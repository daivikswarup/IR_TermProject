Headline::::As RSS Feared, Amit Shah Lost Bihar For BJP



DateTime::::2015-11-08T21:40:00+05:30




                                Nothing, absolutely nothing can beat the instinct of a reporter on the ground. From the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to the thumping Bihar mandate for the RJD-JDU-Congress Mahagatbandhan today, journalists with an ear to the ground have been proved right despite varying and contradictory opinion and exit polls. 
And why would a reporter covering Bihar not get it right when, for the past few months, the writing has been on the wall? In a column just days ago for ndtv.com, I wrote that the RSS wanted Amit Shah, the BJP President and Bihar in-charge to lose the  election. The Sangh, the ideological parent of the BJP, was feeling increasingly left out with Shah's autocratic way of functioning and the extreme centralization of decision-making powers between the Prime Minister and him.
Today, as I write this, the Mahagatbandhan or Grand Alliance is inching towards the 178 mark with Lalu's party, the RJD, emerging as the single-largest party in Bihar. After being routed in Delhi by the Aam Aadmi Party, Narendra Modi, who along with Amit Shah had worked electoral magic in Gujarat during his long tenure as Chief Minister, committed one blunder too many. Shah, the poll manager in most of Gujarat's state elections and Modi's top confidante, played the caste and religion card in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the national election; the state gave the BJP its maximum seats.
 
Shah, now as party president, was also in-charge of the Maharashtra polls in October 2014 and along with an energetic campaign by the PM, he won the state amid a strong anti-incumbency sentiment for the Congress-Sharad Pawar coalition. However the real test for Amit Shah came in Delhi in February this year and it is here that the master strategist first faltered. The power duo of Modi and Shah, who had isolated most voices in the BJP including party veterans, ignored local leaders in Delhi and made a last-minute choice of Kiran Bedi as the Chief Ministerial candidate opposite Arvind Kejriwal. The decision led to the BJP's complete decimation in the national capital.
 
But Shah, who had by now earned the ire of many senior leaders in the RSS, was in favour of centralizing power as opposed to building leadership in states, a strategy that led to the Congress being reduced to 40 seats in 2014.
Despite the presence of ex-deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi in Bihar, Shah dominated all electoral posters in the state along with the PM who addressed nearly 30 rallies, a record in itself.
The Grand Alliance woven together by Nitish, Lalu and Congress forced the BJP to develop amnesia over the RSS' stated line of discourse on Dalits and reservations, and Shah kick-started the election campaign on  Dr BR Ambedkar's birth anniversary, in an outreach to the lower caste vote, which has traditionally spurned the BJP.
The strategy could have well worked for Amit Shah, had he realized the difference of political and caste dynamics between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In Uttar Pradesh, he shrewdly consolidated the Jats, Yadavs and upper-caste Hindus under the umbrella of Hindutva. But "kamandal" (political Hindutva) was not the answer in Bihar, where caste is the tent pole of politics. 
As they say, ask a child in Bihar his caste and he will tell you the difference of caste between him and his closest friend. Shah tried to win the caste formula in Bihar by adding to the mix Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, a Mahadalit and Ramvilas Paswan. But he made the PM the face of the election campaign despite suggestions from senior leaders in Bihar including Shatrughan Sinha and Kirti Azad to consolidate local forces. 
The PM, without any pretence of diplomacy, auctioned financial packages in his rallies for Bihar and targeted infamously the DNA of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. It is from here that the BJP started to make a steady decline in the state. The campaign, which started on the development plank, gave way to the worst possible personal barbs about Mahagathbandhan leaders.
 
The last straw in the decline of its fortunes came when Mohan Bhagwat gave his controversial statement on reservations, asking the BJP not to ignore the aspirations of the upper class. Then the BJP's Union Minister VK Singh appeared to compare the murder of two Dalit children to a dog being killed. 
Amit Shah, the rank outsider or "bahari" as he was called by his opposition hinted at ground being lost when he spoke late last month of the Bihar elections not being a referendum on Narendra Modi. 
Towards the last phase of the polls when nothing worked, Shah and his party resorted to the tried and tested communal polarization with cow posters emerging on the streets and Shah stating that crackers would burst in Pakistan if the BJP lost. BJP MPs used the Pakistan rhetoric to allude to the minorities, and brazen statements on beef-eaters were professed on a daily basis before the last two phases of polling.
Amit Shah's arrogance, which has been called out by one of its most significant allies, the Shiv Sena, had an RSS ideologue confess in an off-record conversation with me that the BJP would be restricted to 70 seats in Bihar. The party will close below that.
 
This election was a high-stakes prestige battle for Amit Shah with the election for Party President scheduled in January. There is already talk of churn, heightened by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat meeting former BJP president Rajnath Singh today. 
If Shah is the big loser of this result, Nitish Kumar, who has won is already being supported by Arvind Kejriwal, Mamta Banerjee and the Congress. The BJP has ceded space to new regional kingmakers. Like Gautam Buddha, it seems Bihar has once again come to the rescue of the secular nature of the country. going on to prove that communalism can and still be given a tough fight by the common man despite those in power. The litti chokha has finally prevailed upon the arrogance of Lutyen's Delhi.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            BJP's latest definition of tolerance, as per their MP - watching an SRK movie. So, an intolerant person should not watch an SRK movie, say DDLJ, even if the person likes the story/movie ? Hilarious.

                            We have to look at the profile and background of Mr Amit shah!! what can we expect from stock broker and an agent! This is a best answer for the arrogance of My Modi, Amit shah in particular and to the BJP. Things in all spears have become worse since Mr Modi has become PM, the only savior for Mr Modi and the BJP govt were the fall in the global crude oil praises otherwise the inflation would have rocked high. The way Mr Modi lead BJP has polarized the nation the less than 2 years is quite alarming! There is a huge lesson for everyone in th Bihar electoral results.. if some of us don't like the politics of Lalu yadav, then we have to blame BJP leadership who are the main cause for his resurgence by playing nasty politics of polarization and cast.

                            The BJP needs to introspect. It is starting to look like the Congress with an all powerful High Command. In a democracy power has to be decentralised and shared to bring the best of talent, especially local, for the benefit of the party. Both the Delhi and Bihar elections have proved that. Perhaps the BJP needs a new party chief as well. Plus there can be only a one point agenda - development and growth. All other irrelevant issues need to be sidelined. The country is interested only in that one point agenda. That is the only way forward, both for the country and the BJP.

                            High time Modiji focuses on working as a Prime Minister instead of being a poll campaigner. Nowhere in the history of a party have we seen a Prime minister running away from his duties to ensure win for his party in all the state elections.  In fact due to this Modiji is always in campaign mode and even when he is abroad his speech and tone is the same even though it is not fair for a PM to talk the way he does in a foreign land. But who is there to tell him that.. Let us hope the Bihar election results may be an eye opener for him while on his tour to UK..

                            Whether RSS feared or NOT, Bihar elections results are obviously as "Desired" by Ms. Ayyub.  Results are due to high population of Muslims, who always "unite" on religion. Hindus have been "kept" divided by PSEUDO secularist politician and in particular by Nehru Congress and adverse effect in Bihar has been, due to very HIGH illiteracy. As well BJP has deviated from Hindutva. Time has come for Hindus  to "unite", to restore lost legitimacy to live Honorably in their OWN country. If Modi &amp; team failed to do so, some one else will take the responsibility, for Hindus.

                            Oh what an article from so called secular reporter. Please don't join the chorus of politicians in the name of journalism in giving biased opinions like this lest no journalism will have an ounce of credit whatsoever. You may have your opinion Rana but try to play the role of constructive criticism. It is all easy to praise the people who won and criticise the losers but that is the reaction expected out of amateurs and children not from matured people. Don't forget that Nitish had given life to the most bluntly corrupted discoverer of jungle raj RJD and created a big problem for Biharis. I know few colleagues of mine who used send their children to school in Delhi or other places but Bihar fearing abduction and ransoms. Today just because of the jealousy Nitish had with Mr.Modi he had come out and out of desperation joined people like Lalu. So what happened is sad and what is in store for Biharis is disaster ( I wish to be wrong). So this talk about communalism secularism had costed us almost  70 years of no development and never ending tag of Developing 3rd world country.

                            Media scuttled the development of India by playing minority card on one Incident. Now that JDU+RJD+CONGRESS won the Bihar, In Rajayasabha they block the development of India. I call media is responsible of blocking development. Media used its ire on Modi to downgraded India's image. One side Modi is working hard to improve the image of India from Corrupt CONGRESS regime other side media is hell bent on downgrading image of India. What a pity? Does media wants development or block the development. This question also applicable to NDTV. We people of India are certainly more worried now that CONGRESS+RJD+JDU block parliament and block the development of India. Our understanding is that media is plays caste politics, media plays pro Muslim  based by ditching Hindus. Whatever happened in Bihar clearly displays that there are bad days awaited for upper castes and bad days awaited for lower castes.

                            BJP lost as dal price increased to Rs200/kg. Also price increase in other things.<br/>
Another main reason is they increased BSNL broadband price, added more taxes &amp; cheated to give minimum 2Mbps speed. We BSNL broadband user &amp; network warriors who supported BJP working 15 hours/day during Loksabha election are being cheated by BJP with false promises. So we didn't support them this time.<br/><br/>
This is warning for their false promises. If you don't fulfill your promises, then we will create a new party Hindu Janta Party.<br/><br/>

                            Rana Ayyub,<br/><br/>
I have been keenly following every article that you have been writing and I swear your's is always the best and most relevant to the topics and the predictions in politics. Most of your articles on the future in politics of BJP hits a Bull-Eye. I like your vision and unbiasness in writing the articles, a perfect journalism attitude and content in today's time. What you had stated in your previous articles is exactly what has happened. I hope Nitish's alliance will not be able to get along far with Lalu and congress. Even in win I did not see happiness on Nitish and Arvind Kejriwal's face. Arvind might have one more PM contender Nitish to fight in next election of 2019 if AAP and Grand Alliance of Janta Dal excluding congress decides to fight next 2019 lok sabha election separately. The aspiration of Arvind, Nitish, Rahul and Modi are same, 2019 will be a big fight on the national front and for the first time I think there will be 4 PM candidate. On Geo political scenario the loss in bihar and continuance of this trend will actually make Modi's life and India prosperity difficult once the CEPC project in Pakistan is completed. The Make-In-India will see a major set back as west China, Pakistan and Afganistan will become the next hub of manufacturing shunting India as a manufacturing hub. USA will take deep strategic shift tilting towards China and Pakistan as USA economically cannot fight against China (China's control in keeping interest rate and inflation in check by investing in USA treasury bonds), and India to overtake China in such a small time around 2018-2019 cannot happen because of lack of political and economic consensus between political parties in India. The disintegration of Pakistan (through political process, as war is not possible) and making it a land lock country is the only way to finish USA, Russia and China hegemony against India which they exercise by using Pakistan against India, secure future for Make-In-India, open the economic corridor to the middle east &amp; Central Asia while integrating whole economies from Indonesia up to Europe via central Asia and spread its dominance in the region but to do this political will is needed which all parties irrespective of Modi is lacking. Politicians are not able to see the troubling time ahead. India will be in a big mess around 2018 - 19 when China and Pakistan will start militarily threatening India after CEPC is success. USA has strategically started getting neutral towards Pakistan if we look at the recent joint statement of Obama and Sharif in USA. In next few years if RSS keeps on behaving fanatically then the USA and West will blame India as a hindu fundamentalist and militant state which will help them in isolating India and patronizing Pakistan as secular state. The west has always been hypocrite, Pakistan always smarter than India because they were able to sustain themselves quite well even when they were a militant state, India always had economically weak allies unlike Pakistan which has USA and China. The geo position of Pakistan is far more interesting to USA economically and politically than India, the reason why USA postponed the withdrawal of troop from Afganistan. <br/><br/>

The BJP (Beef Jealous Party) got its due for killing people by sponsoring riots. Ghost of Dadri hit hard to BJP. You cannot make people fight, and drink their blood and win elections. BJP is a party of selfish criminals who can stoop to any low to gain power. BJP should understand that money-power and muscle-power cannot win elections always.....

                            After I commented few days back on your article and now going through the articles of other writers what I see is by losing bihar Modi and Shah has actually won and this will be confirmed only in the winter session of the parliament in November if the thought hold good enough which will actually contradict your article. There is a big political turmoil after Grand Alliance win in bihar. <br/><br/>
- The increase in the vote share of BJP by 8% (24% in total) which confirms its states quo of dedicated share of forward classes vote is intact and ensured despite of backward class and polarization politics. <br/>
- BJP won seats mostly in western bihar adjoining to UP. So how will the election in UP end up will be question for SP and BSP to answer.<br/>
- If Grand Alliance will project itself as third front in 2019 election then who will be the party candidate for PM - Nitish, Lalu, Mamta, Mulayam, Arvind. Will the congress sacrifice projecting Rahul as PM for third front ? Will Arvind Kejriwal compromise himself as been projected as PM candidate and wait for next 5 years after 2019 for PM. Will Sonia Gandhi compromise Rahul as PM candidate for 2019 and support third front ? Will Mulayam also compromise ?<br/>
- Incase Grand Alliance breaks before 2019 general election and Arvind fight separately, third front separately and congress separately then how will the secular vote bank split between them because BJP's forward class vote bank is secured.<br/>
- The big gain for BJP will happen in South India as can already seen in Kerela where hindus have been marginalized over the years by pro muslim and christian run government. Amma too is not in good health.<br/>
- Looking at Grand Alliance will Mamta and CPI(M) in Bengal come to fight election together ? If yes then who will be CM ? If no then how will the secular and forward class votes split between them ? <br/>
- After bihar election win within congress do the veterans actually feel happy that Rahul is credited with winning 24 seats for congress which will help Sonia in projecting Rahul Gandhi's candidature for party President and PM. The question is over the years what have the veterans worked for in congress just to work under another dumb headed Gandhian dynasty ruler even though they know that they are a better contender than Rahul for presidentship and PM. Based on this differences within congress if you see RSS is radicalizing by creating pull factor towards hindutva and veterans within congress are actually pushing people towards BJP by speaking exactly against hindutva and for pro-muslims thus pushing more and more hindus towards BJP. The reason for doing this is because veterans know that there is no gain for them in congress, at the most they can become cabinet ministers or governors but succumb to dynasty rule of Gandhis.<br/>
- L K Advani and team cannot do anything against Modi, Shah and Bhagwat because they know even together they cannot ensure win for BJP in any assembly election and in 2019. L K Advani ke naam pe tho dus vote bhi nahi milega BJP ko. Just look at Anti Modi people like Gadkari who against Modi as PM is now against comments made by L K Advani. Gadkari had to leave BJP presidentship and replace by Bhagwat because Gadkari was anti Modi and RSS brought Bhagwat because he was pro Modi. RSS believe in Modi as the leader was confirmed when even after tumultuous Gujarat riot Modi stuck to Sangh ideology and won subsequent state elections despite of so much of opposition. It was actually Advani and Vajpayee who in press conference condemn Modi after which RSS believe in Advani and Vajpayee was over. Till date Advani wins elections in Gujarat is because of Shah as Modi has instructed Shah to do so. Vajpayee would not have got Bharat Ratan if Modi would not have been PM. It is a way of Modi slapping Vajpayee and making him realize that despite of Vajpayee blaming Modi for Gujarat riot it was Modi who brought him the honor of getting Bharat Ratan.<br/>
- RSS for the first time in its history is actually ruling the country through Modi in whom the Sangh ideology is deeply engraved. Even Vajpayee had sideline RSS after winning election and coming to power because he was more of a moderate and Nehruvian ideology follower. Modi on the other hand is breaking the Nehruvian framework from its very roots which can be seen in the form of protest at the institutional level by civil society like FTII, IIT, IIM, JNU, Media, Writers, Historians, banning NGOs etc. Modi knows if he controls money he can control everyone against him and this is the reason why he banned NGOs, NGOs were a big source of earning corruption money for Media, writers,historians, political party veterans and their families both for veterans within BJP and congress. He is slowly breaking the back bone of corruption and establishing the framework for promoting hindutva ideology as without it for RSS to rule India for a longtime through BJP will not be possible.<br/>
- The regional parties are better placed with BJP than they were with congress, atleast Modi does not bully them like congress did with them when they supported congress at center. Modi has given more funds to non BJP lead state government like Bengal (40,000 cr). Remember Lalu who was put behind bar under congress rule despite of supporting congress at center. DMK's Daughter put behind bar. If BJP had to win bihar then a stalwart like Shah would have had Lalu's bail cancelled in Jharkhand and send him back to Jail months before election where he is serving sentence for Fodder Scam. It would have been easy for BJP to win more seats but it did not do so and what is the reason for not doing so have anybody thought about it ? Why BJP placed more forward class candidates and criminals in areas where Lalu and Congress have won have anyone thought about it ? Why did BJP announced it lists after announcement of list of Grand Alliance and that too separately ? Why in the middle of the election did Bhagwat raised the reservation issue twice are RSS and Shah poor politician I do not think so. What happened to all the writers and protesters where have they gone after election ?<br/>
- As far as Shatrugan Sinha going against Modi is concerned it could all be a gimmick played by RSS to keep a watch close watch on Nitish and to bring Shatrugan Sinha close Nitish Kumar. Atleast Nitish knows one thing for sure that it was easy to govern with BJP despite of no funding by congress when it was at center than to work in alliance comprising of Lalu and congress after all nature and character of people do not change.<br/>
- RSS is also polarizing Muslims within Muslims and they are doing it in a fantastic way. RSS over the past 10 years has put all the thinking together to rule the country many many years.<br/><br/>
Only the coming winter session of parliament will decide the future course of politics in India.

                            Simple question for people advocating removal of modi-shah, did they ever wondered about their replacement ? real question is do we have a strong leader to lead from the front or we want silent Man Mohan Singh or fractured national mandate in the country ? If we can't suggest a leader who can lead then why keep wasting time on bashing modi-Shah

                            the article looks coherent and logical till the last para, where she blurts out her bias against BJP and Modi. Still points BJP should listen to. However one thing eludes the logic is that as long as the so called secular forces play communal cards - collect muslim votes, christian votes and cast votes , which is what Lalu and Nitish has played and so also Congress for the last, 60 years , the "secular press" is fine, If BJP consolidates the Hindu votes, ignoring the caste barriers, it is an unforgivable sin!!! Is it because they are scared if the old order changes, their sponsorship structure will get dismantled ?

                            Whatever has happened in the country so far in the name of secularism is not accepted, at the same time Modi is trying his level best to improve economical health of India, which Congress never thought of. Best is Modi has some vision for the country at least and he is working on it. Suddenly people are saying he is good for nothing - I would like to ask all intellectuals to whom I should support - are you sure congress or Lalu or.......please advise.
