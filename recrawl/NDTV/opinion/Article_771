Headline::::Why IIT Founder Nehru Wanted Arts for Engineers



DateTime::::2015-08-19T22:06:00+05:30




                                An acronym that has gained great of currency in the last few years, especially in the context of the debate around IITs, is the powerful agglomerate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). What I want to suggest today is that we need a balancing acronym which I will tentatively call LEAF (Liberal Education in the Arts Fields) for a more holistic view of education in general, and Indian education in particular. Such a perspective that gives due weight to culture, history and memory is especially moot when we have a very young population, as we currently do in India. How might STEM and LEAF complement each other under these circumstances? I'd like to ground my answer to this question in a very particular context namely, the role played by Humanities and Social Science Departments in the IITs today.
Although the IITs have been around for more than half a century, many members of the general public still do not know that the humanities subjects were included for credits in the curricula of the IITs from the beginning. Every single engineer who has attended an IIT has passed through its Humanities and Social Science (HSS) Department. But why? To understand this, let's go back to a major difference between a standard issue university and a technical institute.  
Briefly, a university, as its name indicates, aims to be inclusive, universal. This word was first used in English in 1300 to refer to "the whole entire number engaged at a particular place in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of learning" (Shorter Oxford). 
An institute, on the other hand, if we turn to its etymology, derives from the Latin verb for 'to establish' and has a more recent origin, since this word was only used after "1795 in post-revolutionary France" (Shorter Oxford). Note that this usage was coined nearly five centuries after the word "university". No wonder, then, that the characteristic feature of this model of learning is its modern emphasis on specialization or "expert" technical knowledge.
 
This stark difference between the ideologies of the university and institute, we can now see, is in fact exemplified by a 'meritocratic' system like that of the IITs. Students with an aptitude for scientific and technological subjects are exclusively admitted to these institutes on the basis of some extremely tough exams. However, the STEM and LEAF structure within the IITs is, surprisingly, far from exclusive. It actually presents us with an imaginative 'hybrid' of the two models cited. Indeed, the IIT Charter explicitly says that they were set up with two broad, egalitarian objectives:
 
a) the advancement of knowledge through education and research, in both Pure and Applied Science, in Engineering, Social Science and Humanities;
b) service to the community and nation (which we refer to as Extension activity) through the use of their resources both intellectual and material.
 
In the above respect, the IITs closely resemble the great US technological universities (MIT, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon) which themselves gradually expanded to include every discipline, leaving their instrumentalist beginnings behind, but retaining their commitment to 'excellence'. This 'turn to the humanities and social sciences' and the consequent flourishing research in interdisciplinary areas has, we know, been highly beneficial in the case of US universities and by no means detrimental.
 
In India, for a variety of reasons, we have chosen not to follow the US path, although some of the newer IITs (Gandhinagar, Hyderabad) have groomed their HSS Departments with particular care, as have some older IITs (Kanpur, Delhi). Some others offer postgraduate degrees in humanities subjects like Economics (Madras). This is because of a growing realization that the HSS Departments are today far from 'service' departments - if they were ever that. The HSS subjects, at their best, introduce reflexivity, an ability to argue and logically present arguments, delight in unfamiliar, independent ideas and a view of the universe not merely as a nuts-and-bolts construction, but a changeable sphere of human interaction that can be conceptualized from a variety of philosophical and civic angles.
 
The founder of the IITs, Jawaharlal Nehru, appears to have understood this well. Anticipating that such institutes could become too narrow in focus, he wanted a structural component within the system that was oriented towards turning technologists into 'better men and women'. Specifically addressing engineers, he said:
"I know you can measure with your techniques and rules the hardness and strength of this metal or that, of stone and iron and whatnot...How do you measure the strength of an individual? The human being as material is not only a difficult material but an exciting material because it is a live material, a growing material, a changing and dynamic thing. No two persons are alike and we have to build with that material... [and] function in the environment of India with the material of India... It is important that...engineers advance to become better men and women."
It is that task of moulding 'exciting' human material to which Nehru thought that the HSS departments could signally contribute. So I wonder how Nehru would have answered the anonymous commentator in these NDTV columns who not so long ago charmingly wanted to rid the IITs of "humanities cockroaches". With his deep mistrust of the humanities, this commentator is unlikely to have read Kafka's great story "Metamorphosis", where the hero wakes up one morning to find himself turned into a giant insect, prompting a truly deep meditation on the human condition. He would probably not have read the famous Tagore-Einstein dialogues and be quite unfamiliar with Martin Heidegger's mystic dictum that the 'essences' of art and technology are connected; and almost certainly, he would be befuddled by the views of a world authority on cockroaches, Srini Kambhampati at U Texas, who might assure him that not only are roaches are among the world's hardiest species, the nitrogen cycles on which we all depend would be quite shot were we to get rid of these alarming creatures. 
 
Ironically, though, a student at the IITs might be aware of many such intriguing, offbeat truths, thanks to his humanities courses - which could well serve to teach him the fine art of wonder, the basis of all science.
 
For the most part, I believe, the long suffering IIT students seem to enjoy their 'HUKKAH' courses because these allow them, as they sweetly put, to 'learn to relax'. Once, I got them to do a 'stereotypic' self-portrait in class. Here are the half-dozen or so jokey points they came up with:
 
1. Good at PCM, bespectacled, nerdy, very smart.
2. Lacking in communications skills, especially when it comes to girls.
3. Think they can conquer the world, extremely competitive.
4. Interested in sports, video games.
5. Not too keen on reading long books.
6. Practical, focused on details and on getting results.
7. Like the idea of money but are not too sure or sophisticated about how to spend it.
Nehru himself put that last point somewhat more elegantly. He had "no doubt at all" Nehru wrote, "that India will....advance in science and technology. But what I am concerned with is not merely our material progress but the quality and depth of our people. Gaining power through industrial processes, will they lose themselves in the quest of individual wealth and soft living?" he asked.
 
These prophetic thoughts about the corruptions of "soft living" have returned, as we know, to haunt us today. Nehru solidly put his faith in engineers as the "creators" of modern India, but it is this very creativity that he thought would be augmented and extended in HSS classes:
"The Engineering approach to problems would be the scientific approach coupled with the urge for creation, the urge to make and produce new things for the common good. The main thing is that the growth of the individual, the group, cannot be imposed on him."
The STEM and LEAF combine in short was written into the DNA of the IITs. It is time we see it flower.

                            The premise that Nehru was the "founder" of the IITs is a myth. The IITs were set up based on the recommendations of a pre-independence technical committee established by Viceroy Lord Wavell, and Nehru was not on that committee and had nothing to do with it. In any event, Nehru died in 1964 when the first batch of engineers had just graduated from *one* IIT, and the other IITs were still under construction. Nehru had nothing to do with shaping the IIT curriculum or scholastic structure.<br/><br/>
If the Humanities departments at the IITs are still labouring under the misconception that Nehru "founded" the IITs, then it's probably a very good idea to dispense with them.

                            Nehru was the visionary . He took India forward and on the foundation he laid that made India which has become regional power and future super power.

                            Beautiful article, I am an engineer myself but strongly feel that lack of quality history education makes engineers less affinity towards India. We lack education were there is stress about sacrifices made by many of our ancestors to make India reach this level, our history education is only limited to mostly independence struggle.<br/><br/>
There should be a study which should show how many IIT and IIM graduates have immigrated abroad. I feel they lack the will to struggle in India and make it a success, they are supposed to be leaders and if we are building weak leaders then India will always be weak.

                            Hi,<br/>
I remember reading an article by Mr.Fareed Zakaria, editor of CNNs program GPS. He was batting for the same cause that this article's author bats. Mr.zakaria tries to give an argument that USA should not leave the academic syllabus that is followed now which includes liberal arts. He believes (Rightly so) that only because of this USA's enterpreneurship flourishes.<br/><br/>
He also categorically denounces the academic excellence of Asian students (Robots), most of them can only be followers and not creators of anything.(This includes India).<br/><br/>
The author is totally right to bat for this idea that liberal arts is a must for every student or i should say human being. But unfortunately, the time is running out. We in India have already missed this bus and started assembling robots.

                            Credit is given to Nehru for founding IITs.  What a load of rubbish!  Are we saying that had we not had Nehru there would have been no IITs?  This is like saying that Rajiv Gandhi who gave himself the sobriquet 'Computer Boy' introduced mobile phones!  One again, utter rubbish!  Such diverse countries as Burundi, Niger, Bolivia and Laos also have mobile phones and nobody in these countries would have heard of Rajiv Gandhi and neither would Rajiv Gandhi even have known about these countries!  It is time we stopped grovelling to that carpetbagger family and realised that India has millions of talented people quite capable of making progress without having to attribute everything to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty!

                            Probably a greater need of the hour is to include basic science and tecnology courses in liberal arts currilculum especially Journalsm. Journalists today seem too illogical and completely out of touch with reality and just dont seem to know priorities. See the "liberal overload" we had during the Yakub menon affair. I see a red herring the moment someone starts out with jargon like "holistic". One can be sure that the rest of the article will be pseudo liberal hogwash.

                            The article by IITDelhi Professor Rukmi Bhaya has made a case for LEAF (Liberal Education in the Arts Fields) in IITs. While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the value and worth of liberal arts I do not subscribe to beating its drum too much in our engineering and technology education system that is driven by the strength of STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. The only new addition is biotechnology  and biological sciences. <br/><br/>
Let me share with you my experience during my studies in UK in 1970s. At that time the drums of liberal arts were being echoed as being important to create the human face of science and engineering. The emotional appeal was so strong for liberal arts at that time in universities in the west that  it drove the younger generation away from STEM. The net result was a rapid decline in interest for mathematics and science even at school levels let alone at the university. <br/><br/>
Thank God that the western universities were able to draw immense talent in STEM from India and other eastern countries where love for mathematics and science was so profound that the younger generation was keen to explore the realms of science and the joy of engineering and technology in company of the great science and technology minds of learned professors and practitioners in great western universities and in the R&amp;D organisations and corporates.<br/><br/>
Even today the western world is at a loss to understand as to how to bring back the love for science and joy of mathematics back into its schools and universities.<br/><br/>
Compared to this, mathematics is the foundation of India's rich and profound spiritual civilisation and science, vigyana, is the body fluid of Indian way of life. As such the natural love for STEM from school to university levels in India is something both natural to our scientific spiritual civilisation and we should be proud that this craze for STEM continues to drive India's landscape of education, higher education included.<br/><br/>
 I would therefore suggest that rather than beating the drum of LEAF ( Liberal Education in the Arts Field) we should integrate humanities and arts in STEM to make it STEAM (Science, Technology,Engineering, Arts and Mathematics). In any case, the human interface of science and technology is today more important than ever before as we have the monumental challenge of creating a better and brighter tomorrow by creating energy in plenty, moping out the monstrous  environmental pollution (land, water and air), wiping out poverty and hunger by creating millions and millions of jobs and enterprises, all this requires a more profound commitment to STEAM.<br/><br/>
As a former professor of IIT Delhi, I have tremendous pride in the goodness created by the IITs for India and for the great nations of the world. Let us not forget this pride created by the IITians is primarily because of their sustained focus on creativity and innovativeness of science, engineering and technology on the strength of STEM and not the liberal education in arts field, LEAF. Let the new generation not undermine the value and worth of STEM or better STEAM for creating a better tomorrow for India and the humanity at large.<br/><br/>

                            The history of the IIT system dates back to 1946 when Sir Jogendra Singh of the Viceroy's Executive Council set up a committee whose task was to consider the creation of Higher Technical Institutions for post-war industrial development in India. The 22-member committee, headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, recommended the establishment of these institutions in various parts of India, with affiliated secondary institutions.

                            Nehru's legacy has been overstated through the lens of leftist journalists and historians. This country missed a spectacular chance to over come poverty and become a truly developed country only because of Nehru's flawed economic and political philosophy. A man who could not see the intrinisc strength of this country's civilization, who instead borrowed a wrecked and evil idealogy of communism-marxism from foreign shore does not deserve any credit. History of 21st century India will be judge him very harsh. The fact that we are saddled with a huge continental sized population submerged in poverty and ignorance is a direct consequences of warped thinking of Nenhru.

                            Calling Nehru as the "founder" of IITs is stretching it too far. At the political level, credit for founding IITs should go to Dr B C Roy, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, who was instrumental in persuading Pandit Nehru to create the Indian Institute of Technology Act. The main theme of the article - that we need humanities courses for STEM students - is fundamentally sound (just as sound as the argument that humanities students should also know some maths), but, given that humanities courses are completeley neglected in primary schools and high schools, what is the point suddenly dumping it on IITs ?

                            Make liberal arts classes available to IIT students... but don't make any of them as requirements or substitutes. Advanced math can't be learned later in life easily. So hard sciences should be the first priority. But you can learn liberal arts topics at any stage of life, even for entertainment (I took this route). I also don't feel that engineering schools (including IIT) are teaching enough scientific temper. Liberal arts topics like Philosophy of Science are welcome, while topics like Philosophy of the Mind, History and Sociology just dilute the credits, without providing definitive value, at least at this stage. They should be electives, or non-credit courses at best.

                            Nice article in defence of Social sciences. But the best example of including exciting human material in the curricula of the IITs that comes to the Author's mind is from literature and not from the Social sciences. Even though literature is part of Humanities  in several universities it is now separated from the SS and stands alone with Languages. Proponents of including Humanities or SS+Literature in the institutes of specialist subjects forget one thing; and that is, the modern SS is no more Moral science to include a loose, structural-semeological or holistic study of man and his relations with the man, nature and god. It is the methodology of thinking that is at stake and behind the question of what more is to be taught to the students of working of machines.If you add one more positive science to the subjects of modern western science or of technology, that is not going to help. Probably there is still a large scope of adding subjects like Indian Classics, Greek classics, Indo-anglian literature, Indian literature, Linguistics, Botany, Animal Behaviour, Zoology, Western literature (including Kafka), Great civilizations, Evolution, Poetry etc. . Purpose of such additions is to not to let a brilliant mind be trained unidirectionally, but to provide it new dimensions of possibilities. To get to know that even the modern western science may not have all the answers despite the findings in the CERN. To be humble before the vastness of Nature, Humanity and the Unknown. And above all, there is some more ways of finding mysteries of life and of nature, and that may be different from the baggage of observation-Hypothesising-experimenting-concluding, and even found the other way, they are as valid as scientific conclusions!!

In the late 1960s a west African country, a former French colony, started a medical college, the first in that region. The first batch of graduates from that college all settled in France!<br/><br/>

                            For one, the idea of IITs itself was by another committee. Nehru however took it forward along with the other public sector forays. It is too much of a speculation to think that Nehru went into such details as to whether arts should be there in IITs. As things stand, having these departments is good for students as it broadens their experience. On the negative side these departments have encouraged leftist ideology and student unrest, most recently in IIT Madras.

                            Humanaties. Bunch of retards who know nothing and pretend to study or teach something in a college. They got there because they did not find admission in any other college or did not got teaching assignment in any other area of education.

                            I think all IITians in any given year should gather at the IIT stadium and discuss on the utility of HSS. A few former IITans would be good too.<br/>
Such a discussion/debate will give a good grounding to the newbees and look at HSS with more respect.<br/>
Also, these discussions will foster good public debating skills among the IITans.

                            Why don't you say you got a job at IIT because of Nehru ? Otherwise what qualifications do you hold to teach in IIT? And stop preaching your left wing ideologies!!

                            And Nehru would have also liked that despite humanities courses, IITs have traditionally been acting as EOUs or IAS factories?

                            Too much of liberal arts ends up producing leftist extremists and even anarchists like Arundhati Roy. One must now begin to take a hard look at the word "liberal" itself. Most so called liberals are actually leftist extremists who are just as fanatical as the right wing extremists whom they hate.

                            I wish the great founder of IIT had started inculcating the habits in men and women graduating from the institutes right from early childhood education. It would have been more beneficial and meaningful. Just copying some other nation's vision does not produce the same result everywhere unless we fully understand the reason for establishment of such methods and techniques to improve our own society.
