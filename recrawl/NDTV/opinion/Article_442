Headline::::'India's Daughter' Filmmaker, Leslee Udwin, Writes on the Ban



DateTime::::2015-03-04T16:41:00+05:30



(Leslee Udwin is an award-winning filmmaker who has made the documentary ' India's Daughter'.)
	 
	I am deeply saddened by today's attempts to silence the film ' India's Daughter' and to derail an impassioned plea for gender equality.
	This is a documentary I left my young children and the comfort of my home for, to spend 2 years dedicated to a crucial cause in the public interest of women, not just in India but worldwide.
	 
	India is a democracy with civilised laws, but sadly this flouting of a basic right to freedom of speech by whomsoever has lodged the FIR, and equally depressingly, the irresponsible and sensationalist 'journalism' of the Times Group, is flying in the face of civilised values.
	I am hugely indebted to NDTV  which has stood by this film so firmly and with such commitment - because its values are civilised and admirable.
	I urge Mr Modi to deal with this unceremonious silencing of the film.
	I came here out of love for India, and because India had led the world by example in the unprecedented protests of its courageous men and women who came out on the streets to fight for my rights as a woman.
	India should be embracing this film - not blocking it with a knee jerk hysteria without even seeing it. This was an opportunity for India to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime; sadly, the FIR and the banning of the film will see India isolated in the eyes of the world. It's a counter productive move. Whoever is behind this - please see the film and then come to a conclusion.
	 Premission from Ministry of Home Affairs to Interview Delhi Gang-Rape Convicts
	 Consent from Convict Mukesh Singh to be Interviewed for the Documentary

                            Can you explain what the film is intending to achieve by taking an opinion of a convicted criminal who has eccentric views other than sensationalising and causing unrest? Have you balanced it in anyway by taking opinions of normal citizen? How much have you made from this interview?<br/>
How do you think this interview will contribute to the solution? Have you suggested any solution at all?

                            The government should not have intervene to ban the movie. The regressive mindset of these thugs should be exposed. The lawyers defending the convicts were saying that no women should step out her house post 6 P.M. <br/>
What kind of a society tolerates these people. Swift justice should be delivered and stronger laws should be enforced. This is a plea to the judiciary and the government

                            the documentary focuses on the ugly truth that we as a society have failed on the issue of gender equality. there is a tremendous amount of class difference in India. people from backgrounds like those of the 2012 rapists grow up watching their mothers and sisters being mistreated, having no rights or say. they are 'groomed' in a way that they think girls who speak their mind and do what they wish are 'loose' and can be mistreated in any manner.<br/>
people only blame men when it comes to gender inequality. but what about those women who themselves favor their sons over their daughters. the ones who ask for dowry when their son gets married. the ones who insist on a grandson. <br/>
if u really want people to see it, just upload it on youtube. I mean, if people can see crap like AIB roast on it, they can see this too.

                            When Mulayam Singh Yadav's "Boys will be boys...." remarks can be aired on all Indian television channels, this documentary too can be aired. Personally, I do not see any difference between the two uncivilized remarks.

                            Trying to hide existing criminal attitudes and views is a sign of our undeveloped society and country. We are a society hiding under the comfort of ignorance. Women in India will never be safe until we expose and deal with the terrible views of its men.

                            I firmly believe that the documentary can be telecasted but the one thing that really annoys me is the interview of the convict.Nothing is going to change in the mindset of the people after listening to this interview.Had these convicts been hanged before that would have definitely brought in some fear amongst those people who would dare to think of committing such barbaric acts.There are millions of people who would really get offended and hurt after listening to the interview.

                            Nothing has changed in this Country. We are very good at suppressing facts. We are the greatest hypocrite living on Planet earth. We dont Punish Culprits rather we give them their right ti live because we dont wanna work and thats the reason we dont have Laws to punish criminals of any nature. We do our best to hide facts and if at all they come out in the open, we blame it on other country's and communities that they try to defame us BUT never make an effort to make Laws to Punish criminals within the Country.

                            Shame, all that big talk about freedom of expression gone through the roof. I simply do not understand, if Nirbhaya's parents are alright with the film, what the hell others have to say about it? This is a classic example of hiding your face on the wall and thinking no one can see you. The fact that India is a male dominated society is not hidden to the world. By banning this film, we have brought more shame on ourselves. No matter home much we pose to be progressive and modern, deep inside we are still medieval. We have this habit of running away from the fact, dreaming about the "sone ki chidia" we once used to be. But the hard fact is, women in India are yet to attain freedom, hello: that's 50% of the country's population.

                            This is just one off case. Hundreds or even thousands of cases much worse do happen and never get reported. We see such examples re-enacted in our Hindi Movies (although a hero comes to rescue or fight it but in real time nothing happens and the villain is the winner). This documentary may not be any different from our Hindi Movies, did not understand the wisdom of the people who are trying to block it.

                            The 3rd paragraph in the article above reflects the British writer's mindset. Because her film is blocked she no longer considers India a democracy or a civilized state.<br/>
Ms. Udwin, your rights have not been trampled upon by the person filing the FIR. He has as much right to express his opposition as you have a right to express.<br/>
A psychologist or a sociologist would be more qualified to do a psycho or socio analysis of this morass, not a journalist. She could have interviewed qualified people who have studies this subject for all their lives and come up with a documentary. Interviewing and broadcasting convicts and their defense lawyers only gives them a platform which they don't deserve.<br/>
To some of the comments about defense lawyers being "normal" people - normal and lawyers in the same sentence is against all rules :)

                            Highly probable that most of the world will not see the "truth" in the documentary, instead rejoice with their existing STEREOTYPE of India. Funny that UK (the doc maker's own nation) has a Rape Rate way higher than India, yet how many docs focus on "Rapes in UK". Although this is ALSO TRUE that the Rapist's statement represents 90% of Indian men's mindset &amp; attitude, it is just that the Rapist was blunt and uncouth about it. In India, things are okay till the status quo of men &amp; women is maintained; the moment women retaliate, the ugliest of patriarchy spurts out instantly.

                            I'm baffled by some ignorant comments in this comment section. Its not BJP, the govt that banned the documentary. Someone lodged an FIR and Indian courts have banned it. <br/><br/>
What needs to change is the way Indian courts work when it comes to censorship. Currently, its more in favor of championing the rights of those who protest a film, book, show, etc rather than those who created them.

                            Leslee Udwin lost a great opportunity to explain why Mukesh Singh's interview was not central to the documentary. I support the ban, because in my mind it is giving too much attention to a sick mind, and worse, it is making conclusions about larger mindsets in India based on this sick mind. <br/><br/>
The apprehensive side of me goes on to further surmise that Leslee, having not lived in India for long, doesn't have a grasp of the nature or extent of gender bias in India. For example I doubt if she knows how even extremely biased people were shocked by this crime. I don't know Leslee Udwin, she has no credibility - no offense but it's a fact. If Mark Tully had made a similar documentary, I would have given him the benefit of doubt, and would have been keen to hear what he had to say.<br/><br/>
All in all, Leslee could have done a much better job of explaining to me why the ban is not justified, instead of just lampooning the establishment as "uncivilized" because it doesn't allow "freedom of speech".

                            It is far more deeper and called racial prejudice of western film and documentary makers. You cannot air the view of a convicted rapist to form an opinion of the "attitude of men" or "condition of women" in India. This is like making an opinion of racial and religious prejudice in America based on the videotapes of Osama bin Laden.

                            The law says you have to get the permission to air the video, not for just recording. Have you gotten that? Most of all, what are you benefitting from interviewing a sick mind who is already convicted to death by the law of the land? 1. You could gain popularity especially in the west 2. You can make money commercially 3. You can show India in bad light by playing the role of a holy saint. Come on, people are not fools by you invoking the 'civilized values of NDTV or Induan laws' when you have tried to flout the same for personal benefits.

                            As a responsible citizen of India I feel, this documentary MUST NOT be banned. The filmmaker is absolutely right, crimes like RAPE can only be reduced by shift in mindset. No LAW/PROTEST/DHARNA/POLITICAL DRAMA can change this. If the mindset of society is rotten no one can help it and crimes like this will keep on repeating. Have you taken the count of no. of gang-rapes after Nirbhaya case .......there are many which says it all.

                            So are we Leslee. Pl examine the psyche of Britishers when you ans the following question.Is anyone asking Leslee why did she not film this documentary in her own back yard? Do rapes or brutalities after rapes not happen in the UK? Or are the per capita rapes of India much higher than those in the UK or closer to her home? Or is it OK to be perpetually paint India in a bad light. India is trying to regain some pride after losing most of it after years of subjugation by the British.

                            The same task could have been achieved by interviewing rapists in UK. She need not have travelled all the way to India and spent 2 years away from her children to make this documentary supposedly in the public interest of women, not just in India but worldwide. Her own highly civilised  country has many rapists and paedophiles in the jail. She could have stayed in her own country and done the needful. This sacrifice of 2 years was unnecessary.

                            It is true and shameful that Indian men have such a mind set. This film did bring that issue to the front but it is also a fact that it provided a convinced killer a platform to not only say derogatory things but also suggest to others that "rape and kill". Makers of the film has tried to justify it as a courage of the family to revisit the issue but can they show how many times BBC or other western media have shown convicted criminals of such heinous crimes on the center stage and provided them with platform to justify what they did. Also it is shameful that we have lawyers of this kind and mindset too. Why the film maker could not show the other segment of the society too where women have equal rights and stand as tall as any men, why it has to be only negative aspects of the developing world, is it not their mindset too?. We decided 30 years back that we will have only one child and have a daughter we are so proud of. We are also part of the same society but film maker only had time and resources to show negative aspect of the society. Why they could not show other part of the society to show how things are changing, may be slow but there is ray of hope.

                            I agree that the ban is without purpose. But I thought you could have been more insightful &amp; examining in the film. Instead you opted on content &amp; style that made just a powerful &amp; emotional connect. <br/><br/>
Your personal sacrifices &amp; effort are remarkable. Don't mistake me. But in isolation, your film felt more Bollywood than BBC.

                            Let's ask ourselves a simple question:<br/><br/>
1. What would be better? Punishing the criminal after the crime has occured or preventing a crime from occuring?<br/><br/>
If your choice was: punish and move on, please don't read furter, my intention is not confrontation, just to present a slightly different point of view.<br/><br/>
Now if we are really interested in preventing a crime from occuring then I will present an analogy, and it's just my opinion so I don't expect the entire world to agree with me:<br/><br/>
Any crime, from stealing to rape is like a disease and the only way to find a cure or a preventive measure, is to know more about it, understand the psyche of the criminal, find out in what circumstances and mindset does the criminal think he is justified to commit such a heinous crime. <br/><br/>
Once we get to know the root cause and if we can treat that, we have prevented the creation of the criminal (or future criminals) and hence prevented the crime. (Please read Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and you will understand what I am talking about)<br/><br/>
I know in theory it sounds incredible and I am damn sure we cannot prevent crime 100% nor will this happen overnight but I feel deep down that this is the right way, perhaps not the popular way, but the right way to save our society or any society for that matter from it's own narrow minded view towards this crime and the criminals.<br/><br/>
I watched the documentary, and in the middle I felt so sick when the rape in the bus was being described that I almost fainted (I have this condition that makes me faint when I see or hear graphic details of blood). I stopped the video and cried but once I stopped crying, I went back and watched the rest. I watched because I wanted to understand the psche of the criminal and the people who were openly supporting them (Their Lawyers). I didn't agree with them, but I think I understood them a little better than I had before I watched the documentary.<br/><br/>
This was exactly what Jyoti had done when she had stopped that cop from beating the boy who snatched her purse. She didn't punish the criminal, she cured his crime. She was a true doctor! I salute her.<br/><br/>

                            The documentary has been released on BBC website few hours ago, i just finished watching it.<br/>
There is absolutely nothing which warrants banning it, its so plain, it doesn't even make sense why some are so worked up over it.<br/>
This is another instance which proves that Modi has surrounded himself with idiots.

                            Why release it near women day.<br/><br/>

Every country is in transition to gender equality, we may have some dirty linen but also one in your country - rochdale grooming.<br/><br/>
We are not hiding it, there are laws which are also becoming stringent.<br/><br/>
Inspite of these developments which you sure must have noticed.<br/><br/>
My only question why, why sensationlise it near womens day.

                            Ban everything instead of confronting it. The views of the lawyer representing the convict is far more concerning.

                            I have seen the film in UK and found a very unbiased fact presenting film. It was a poor decision banning this film.

                            For the last few years, it has become a practice, diverting the attention every time in Indian parliament during these budget sessions. Nothing much has changed we are still under the british rule. Before 1947, we are under british government and now we are under british corporate institutions.

                            Leslee Udwin is as commercial as they come, no fault there. Callousness of government officials is no surprise either. It seems that no one paid attention. The ministry of external affairs that issued Leslee a visa to make her documentary in India is supposed to read her story, which they obviously skipped. The Jailer was probably amused that yet another firang has come to get a lowly rapist's video, no biggie. Leslee succeeded where many qualified clinical pyschologists would have failed to get access, slipped through the easily corrupted system right to her central character and made her movie; well done. Now self styled feminists are doing their best to promote it on social media. Question is when will we cure our elite of the rabid sickness that lets them make money off of tortured souls? The media made TRP records with a 3 week long sojourn that elevated a sadly dying victim to a hero. I had called a leading reporter in 2012 and asked her this, "Why Nirbhaya? Did she tell you that she fought bravely or did she say that she pleaded incessantly with her tormentors. How do you know if she felt courage or fear? A victim has rights too, why not use her name when her family agreed, so people can feel the hurt? She defended saying its a privacy issue. Really! you blow up detail after detail in every possible medium, for hours, repetitively airing hospital videos of private injury in public channels and still you speak of privacy. Sadly the victim who could connect with people's hearts was killed much before her body died. A hero Nirbhaya was born to satisfy the lust for breaking news. As always happens with heroes, people don't relate; they assign heroes to praise and forget. Now that the pathetic story is eaten away by top predators; the scavengers have started flocking to get their share of the last juicy bits.

                            Its stupid. India has more than 200million internet user, what if BBC upload the video on Youtube ? There is no way u can stop this video once it gets on internet. Delhi court which banned the video should have been properly informed.<br/><br/>
I am more concerned whether the fimmaker in her enthusiasm for a great story broke some Indian law.

                            I know that civilisation is yet to reach India but I for one did *not* know that animals such as this feller existed. <br/><br/>
It was appalling to hear him say that she shouldn't have resisted and that that one act of "insubordination" of hers is now going persuade future perpetrators such as this creature shall have to kill their victims.<br/><br/>
We have all heard of ISIS and its mindless murder and mayhem and their notions of a woman in society and how men can use them but, one instinctively associated something unnatural with them : psychopaths, sociopaths, whatever. One didn't think them part of what we imagined humans to be.<br/><br/>
But, the words this man used and with natural ease really truly is heartrending and also alarming. <br/><br/>
Any cure for this malaise among the mindset of the men of India requires very drastic societal upheavals. Media and documentaries nor vociferous vituperation on TV will be of no use : the men such as these do *not* waste their times on the media. <br/><br/>
Yet, this man should be preserved. They've already wasted money on him and am sure venerable judges in courts have heard his counsel blame that poor child oblivious to her excruciating pain - I do hope the Lord God damns such counsel and their entire tribes. Having spent that money, they can do another thing : help propagate a message to the real grotesque underbelly of India. <br/><br/>
They should cage him, preferably divest him of all his clothes and parade him all over India - every little town and village - just as circuses of yore paraded their animals. <br/><br/>
They should announce in the local dialect what fate awaits men such as these for the sins that they've committed. Over n over n over. <br/><br/>
This should be done across the length n breadth of India. <br/><br/>
Also, at every stop, little pieces of him should be snipped off. Wee little pieces so maggots may feast on him while the people of the village gaze at him and absorb the message.
