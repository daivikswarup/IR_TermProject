Headline::::Bring Kashmiri Pandits Home. But Not to Ghettos.



DateTime::::2015-04-09T13:06:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a senior journalist and analyst.)The involuntary exile of virtually the entire Pandit community from the Kashmir valley in the wake of the separatist insurgency that broke out in the state in 1988 is one of the great tragedies of independent India. It is also an integral part of the story of human suffering writ large across Jammu and Kashmir, a story of murder and displacement, terrorism, torture and custodial killings that has left virtually no family - Hindu, Muslim or Sikh - unaffected.
As the level of violence in the valley has gradually abated, successive governments at the Centre and in Srinagar have committed themselves to facilitating the safe return of the Pandits to their homeland. Sadly, much like the stillborn political initiatives intended to address the grievances of Kashmiris living in the Valley, there has been hardly any progress on the resettlement front either. Barely 200 families have made the trip back so far.
The reasons for this are complex. For one, some Pandit families in exile remain fearful about continuing threats, and wonder about the wisdom of relocating themselves for a second time when the outcome is uncertain, and their children have developed roots elsewhere in India. The indecisiveness of the Central and State governments in adopting a proper resettlement policy has added to the confusion, as have community organisations like Panun Kashmir which have built their career around the demand for the creation of a Pandit 'homeland' within the Valley.
Then there are economic issues. The government can only promise 'sarkari' jobs, and the bulk of those who have been resettled work for the J&K administration. But the absence of private industry means employment opportunities for young Kashmiris - both those who are already living in the state, and those who might move back - are not especially bright.
Keen to demonstrate its commitment to the Kashmiri Pandits, the Modi government in Delhi has sought to give a fresh push to the resettlement project. But its preferred policy - building "composite townships for Kashmiri Pandits" in the Valley, to quote from the Ministry of Home Affairs press release of April 7 - has triggered a controversy as soon as it was announced. Officially, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, who heads the PDP-BJP coalition government in the state, is committed to acquiring land for these "composite townships". But in the face of criticism from several quarters, including the Congress, the National Conference, Hurriyat leaders and also a section of the Pandit community itself, the PDP is at pains to emphasise that what is envisaged are not ghettos where only Kashmiri Pandits (KPs) will live, but mixed townships that will include Muslims as well, in keeping with the state's traditional pattern of settlement.
The idea of resettling KPs in new townships appeals to the Centre for reasons of administrative convenience and security. Instead of contending with the challenge of making individual Pandit families secure in hundreds or thousands of locations, the government would obviously prefer looking after a finite number of fortified settlements. Administratively, making arrangements for land acquisition and construction of flats for Pandits is much easier if done via the township route rather than by helping families acquire individual dwellings in the neighbourhood of their choice. The overwhelming number of Pandit families who are looking for government help to return to their homeland no longer have dwellings or land of their own. Perhaps some still do, but most disposed of their property in the 1990s.
On the flip side, it is possible that a Pandit township may seem like a more attractive, high-profile target for terrorist groups than dispersed dwellings, and this threat perception is likely to turn these settlements into not just ghettos but heavily militarized compounds, further compromising the prospect for "normal" life as far its resettled residents are concerned.
Anecdotal evidence from the KP housing complex established in 2008 in Sheikhpora, Budgam, also suggests some Pandit families have mixed feelings about being clustered together in this manner. From a political, social and cultural standpoint, the pitfalls of de facto segregation - even if for administrative and military convenience - are obvious. What Kashmir needs is a bridging of its various divides; the move to bring Pandit families back home is a necessary condition for that process,  but it must be handled in a well-thought out manner.
Perhaps what the Mufti government should do is commission a proper sociological study of how the Sheikhpora experiment has worked so far. Do its Pandit residents feel secure? Do they feel they have finally come back home? Do they feel integrated with the life that goes on around them? Have their children settled into the wider cultural environment of the Valley? Do they have friends outside their settlement or are they restricted to merely interacting with each other? The Muslim residents of Budgam should also be asked about their degree of interaction with the Pandit returnees, and whether there are any obstacles or barriers that they perceive or face.
The answers to these questions will help policymakers design a better resettlement policy than what they may have considered so far. Rushing to acquire land and hand out contracts for building flats may make the Modi government at the Centre look decisive, but Mufti sahib must proceed on the basis of a well-formulated plan. If new housing is the only option, then the proposed townships must mirror the composite nature of Kashmiri society the way it was before the Pandits were forced to flee. They must provide ample physical and social space for the process of cultural reconnection.
Two generations of Kashmiri Muslims and Pandits have grown up without knowing each other. Resettlement doesn't just mean physical restitution, but the return of a certain way of life. And that cannot happen within the confines of a ring-fenced ghetto.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What the BJP Govt. at the Center and PDP Govt. in Srinagar are doing is just playing a political game with the Pundits. I wonder if the writer of this blog have any Pundit relatives, I , a non- Pundit has Pundit relatives by marriage. And fully understand the pain of the people. Not  a single Kashmiri Muslim of the Valley made any personal sacrifice to protect the Pundits during 1990s. Will the Pundits take the risk of bring uprooted again? Rather, while the desire remains, it will be pragmatic to make other arrangements. If townships are built for Pundits in the Kishtiwar and Doda area and Govt. sponsored enterprise started there for ALL local people, there will be reasons for Pundits to sink their roots there.They can still be targetted there by terrorists but they can fight back from there.

Is he expert on every thing? <br/>
How many days he remained in Srinagar (not on vacation) and how many days he stayed with Kashmiri Pandit? <br/>
Simple logic that first by creating township with full proof security, it will give good feeling for those who want to come back. Then healing process will start and eventually township concept will go and get together concept will take place.<br/>
Let say example of ONGC townships accross the country. The officer transfered will first start residing in township and later on after few years he buys property in same city or locality and move out of township. <br/>
The same concept applys here.<br/>
Hope good sense prevails.

1.The threatening letters slipped in night time in our houses by not all neighbours by some miscreants among them.<br/>
2.Witnessed the killing of a bsnl officer gangoo who hid in a drum on roof top when militants knocked at his door.It was again a neigbbour who did guide the militant about the hiding spot and the officer was pumped with bullets inside the drum and left officers wife and small kids crying.<br/>
3.The posters of hit target lists with leading pandits of a locality were pasted on electric poles,walls and none in the neighbour could object that.<br/>
4.huge processions calling nizame mustafe was echoing every where.<br/>
5.After killing of few moderate muslims by pak based militants we were told by other muslims of our neighbourhood they they couldnt save their own,so cant guarantee hindus survival.

                            yaa bring them back among murders so that they can be killed again whenever required. A separate colony for Kashmiri pandits is not a ghetto as the author here desperately wants to indicate. Will he stay among ppl who at any point can be motivated by militants and pakistan to kill? Foremost importance should be given to safety of Kashmiri pandits and not to opinion of ppl comfortably sitting in their living room.

                            I see this as similar to some of the separate muslim areas (though not 100% muslims in it)in different parts of india. How does that mean ghettoisation.  Integrating back KP's into Kashmir society cannot be achieved in a day. It will take years but have a heart to appreciate any sincere efforts made in that direction rather than criticizing with personal agenda.

                            Let the Kashmiri Pandits decide how they want to live. Give them the choice and let them decide. Why does Mr. Varadarajan want to give his opinion on issues unrelated to him? If he has gone through the trauma of violence and displacement and felt the pain, then there is some meaning. Many a times it is better not to opine when one has not had the emotional experience.

                            I was very small but I remember how we fled, there were posters pasted outside our home with warning to evacuate within 2 days. I visited my old home recently in Sri nagar which is now occupied by mean neighbour. It really hurts we were very scared and these padosi were so eager to capture our shop and home.  Most of Kashmiri pandot moved to Jammu n Delhi . Even though if there is ghetto we may be safe under military protection but still will be in fear and living within the Muslim community no pandot would ever wish because we know how it is. My relatives lived behind delite cinema for years but due to Muslim they all had to sell their property and relocate now you can hardly find any Hindu home.  It would be very hard to stay within a community where Muslims are more, if you are secular it is good and I invite you to stay any colony of Muslims of your choice and feel the pain

                            Dear Siddharth, <br/>
A reason piece, with but one serious flaw:it offers no solutions. I am a little tired of being spoken about and advised about what is best for me, as a Kashmiri Pandit, especially if the advice is that further inaction (and yes a sociological study) is the best way forward. <br/><br/>
It would have been fantastic if your suggestion included proposals like setting up BPO operations, IT parks in these composite neighborhoods open for employment for all and yet residential areas for predominantly (not exclusively) the returning refugees. That would ensure that the youth got the first crack at interacting with each other in a neutral work environment and gradually as trust was built up the refugees would themselves seek out accommodations outside the township (trust me, Kashmiri Pandits don't have a preference for apartments/flats, they will move out as trust further builds up)<br/><br/>
As I read your article I sense a genuine risk of great being the enemy of good; the Utopian ideal of turning the clock back to pre 1989 era in one swift stroke is just but an excuse to accept that refugees, after over two decades, are not seen to be of significance in the discourse of the valley, state or the country.<br/><br/>
Alternately, maybe it would be more honest if there was an admission that the demographics of the valley has changed for good and we as a nation should be comfortable with that. Let us educate the refugees instead and help them  de-link their identity from the torrid past - let them not be bound by the mythical roots to a mirage called Kashmiriat.

                            Since the Hindus left the valley, it has anyway become a large Muslim ghetto so an argument against creating composite townships does not wash. The idea that Pandits should return to live where they were previously is a non starter because isolated Pandit families were insecure and easy targets. They had to turn to government jobs because they had faced an unofficial economic boycott from Muslims. Few Pandits could own and sustain any business in the valley or get jobs with Muslim owned establishments. Separatists are trying to foil this initiative by arguing for an utopian alternative which they know is impossible. It is time to roughshod over them and settle Pandits.

Murder, Rape, leave behind all property, leave business, left their motherland and living in exile from the last 25 years. No help by neighbours. They were having 'Hand in Gloves' with terrorists. What do you want, to put them in danger again, so that they will be a easy target of separatist and Pakistani terrorist. Do not speak Pakistan's language. First you go and live in Kashmir between muslims and than tell Kashmiri Pandits what to do or not. Moreover who are you ? Who wants your advice ? India is secular because Hindus are in majority, go in Pakistan and write articles in Pakistani newspapers in favour of Hindus, which left only 1% of total population, and see what happen after that.

                            Kashmiri pandit's issue is disgraceful to India, where day and night politicians talk about the secularism and protection for all. Where is the protection for the Kashmiri Pandits. They way they have been murdered, raped, harassed, threatened and forced to run for their life in 80s, it is obvious that not only they have doubt about safety even we have a doubt. <br/><br/>
They should be given full protection with separate Ghettos at least for 20-30 years, so that they culturally and demographically grow.

Is this your opinion or criticism? Do you have any better idea to settle Kashmiri Pandits keeping in mind socio economic problems and more importantly security issue?<br/><br/>
This is the problem with our Analysts in our country. Just keep reading the journals of their choice, politically aligned and personal interest. No practical knowledge or experience.

                            While very few people would want to be virtual prisoners inside their protected enclaves, at present it seems that any Kashmiri Pandits who move to the Valley would be at grave risk; those who wave Paki flags could easily be provoked to lynch Pandits. Regrettably, it seems this issue has to be shelved right now.

                            Mr.Siddarth.We do not exactly know, for sure, whether the Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee the valley or it was a programmed departure.<br/>
There are two questions to be answered :<br/>
1.Why they left Kashmir when 125 crores of us were with them.<br/>
2.Why they want to return when the Chemistry of Jammu &amp; Kashmir remains the same.<br/>
  Mass killings of Muslims have taken place hundred of times in Independent India.The latest one " the Gujarat Model " a genocide took place in Gujarat when Mr. Modi was CM &amp; Mr.Shah was the HM and thousands of Muslims were butchered to death under the very nose of Modi &amp; Shah but non of the Muslims left Gujarat because they knew that all Gujarati are not Modis &amp; Shahs.Great majority of them are nice and decent peace loving citizen of the country.Only those who  do not have any humanity in their hearts and minds will do such heinous work whether it is in Gujarat or in Kashmir.<br/>
Pandits or non pandits all suffered alike in 1988.What happened to them is inhuman and barbaric act .<br/>
Just remember Mr.Jagmohan Malhotra ,the the Governor of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and his henchmen's brutal atrocities against the Muslims of Kashmir. How many butchered to death ? But non left Kashmir.<br/>
In Gujarat in 2002 Muslims in thousands mercilessly butchered to death under the very nose of the then CM Mr.Modi &amp; HM Mr.Shah but Muslims did not leave Gujarat .... their homeland.<br/>
Why Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir ? Was it a motivated politically planned migration from the valley ? Now it seems that they realized " all that glitters is not gold " and they want to return to the Valley.<br/>
Yes . I do 100 % agree as a human being that all Pandits should and must return to the valley because valley belongs to them and they belong to valley.<br/>
But never ever make separate " composite township " for Pandits  because it will be a blunder beyond imagination.

                            Even today, Hindu and Muslim communities tend to live separately. It's common knowledge that Muslims are debarred from purchasing or renting flats in buildings which are predominately Hindu. And we are perpetuating this further, instead of fighting this mindset. History and social studies have  has shown that maximum conflicts occur when communities live separately instead of in a homogeneous mix.

                            You need to be a subject expert to have firm opinions. It can't be that you pick up a issue randomly and give your opinion, why should people read and listen to this.  If this an political article then it is a different matter.  By knowing the author, it is clear that it is a political article, so it is more entertainment than substance.<br/><br/>
The media should be publishing articles from the subject expert rather than from political commentators.

                            Mr VR your idealistic world does not exists in reality. Can you ensure safety of lives of Pandit if they don't have the place of their own to live as community? Hard truth is you cant.  After genocide what we have seen, it is better for Pandits to have their own place, rebuild their lives and peacefully co exits with majority of Kashmir. Till then please show some empathy with Pandits who lost every aspects of their lives due to soft handling of terror issues by successive government for their sikural political benefit and divident

                            The move to resettle pundits should be done slowly and gradually. They cannot be dumped there in a hostile environment. First let them settle in 'ghettos' and then as the years pass, they can move to other parts of the state. It is not 1 day process. Those who oppose know that the day when they return to a 'composite' society will never come and would even oppose the move into exclusive dwellings for pundits, just to gain a few votes of separatists in the state.

                            have courage to write that this kashmiri pandit exile was not due to separatist movement but an ugly face of religious intolerance where one religion dint not tolerate other religion.we are having this religious intolerance since the time of independence but we dont have a courage to speak openly on it .1947 Pakistan created why Religion,Kashmir separate movement why religion .1992 babri masjid Reason religion.2008 Mumbai terror attack reason religion.how long will we keep shying away from this real fact .Please note that secular is a hindu word not found in other religious dictionary

                            For once I partially agree with Vardharajan. Mixed Settlement will be more apt and practical. Separate Ghettos settlement will be a constant issue an eventually may become like another Israel Palestine.

                            Problem her his pundits are not making any noise. There is no leader from their side who want to settle back. One who do not is still part of battle and losses to people who fight/attack.
