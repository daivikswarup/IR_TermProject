Headline::::When Jayanthi Natarajan Found Her Conscience



DateTime::::2015-01-30T20:31:00+05:30

	First there was the "Jayanthi tax", now there is her "letter bomb". But between the corruption allegation leveled against the former Environment Minister by Narendra Modi during the 2014 election campaign and her own litany of complaints against Congress president Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul, the public at large is still in the dark about what exactly went on in her ministry from the time of her appointment in July 2011 till her ouster in December 2013 and after.
	 
	In between Modi's charge that Jayanthi Natarajn levied (and presumably pocketed) a 'tax' from companies in order to clear their projects and her letter to Sonia Gandhi came the news of a likely Central Bureau of Investigation probe into her decision to clear two Jindal projects. 
	 
	The Economic Times reported the matter on October 29 and said the CBI wanted to question her in this regard; other newspapers ran similar stories on November 1 and 2. Three days later, the former minister, who had clearly been nursing her grievances against the Congress high command since January 2014, decided to put pen to paper. Had her November 5, 2014 'letter bomb' been drafted a few weeks earlier, it might have had greater explosive charge.
	 
	The BJP hopes to go to town with Natarajan's revelations because they corroborate the well-known charge that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi interfered with the functioning of the government. 
	 
	Her letter contains some supporting evidence, including this damaging passage: "In fact you have yourself conveyed your concern in this regard in letters written to me. In several cases including the stalled GVK power project regarding the Dhari Devi temple in Himachal Pradesh, the Lavasa project in Maharashtra, the Nirma cement plant in Gujarat and in several other cases I was given specific input, to make my decision. Apart from this Shri Pulok Chatterji, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister was in constant touch with me, and officers of the Ministry in guiding the decisions to be taken by the Ministry at that time." 
	 
	If the decisions Natarajan finally took were consistent with the rules, there may not be much of a controversy here. But if she violated the rules under political pressure from the Congress party's "First Family", there could well be legal consequences for everybody concerned.
	 
	Natarajan also acknowledges "directives" from Rahul Gandhi in the Vedanta and Adani cases and how this earned her the wrath of her cabinet colleagues, though she notes that her decisions to deny environmental clearances here were later upheld by the courts. There is also this confusing statement she makes: "So in my decision-making I have factored in the party line despite all criticisms against me and therefore several decisions of mine were expressly overruled by the Prime Minister."
	 
	It is odd that Sonia and Rahul would expend energy getting a pliant environment minister to do their bidding only to have the PM, who by all accounts was just as pliant, "expressly overrule" those decisions.
	 
	Both in the letter and in her press conference in Chennai, Natarajan has been careful not to suggest the Congress party's "line" on the environment during her tenure was driven by monetary considerations. When asked about Modi's 'Jayanthi tax' charge, she said the Prime Minister should look into the matter and that she was "ready to be hanged" if it was proved that she had committed any wrongdoing. 
	 
	She also denied she was going to join the BJP or any other party, though her comments distancing herself from the Congress position on  'Snoopgate' - the 2013 controversy involving the Gujarat police and Amit Shah illegally monitoring the calls of a young woman, allegedly on behalf of Modi --  suggests she is keeping that door open for later.
	 In political terms, there are six broad conclusions one may draw at this stage from the developing controversy:
	 1. The Gandhi family exercised power without responsibility, and their ministers were quite happy to go along with this so long as they were themselves politically favoured by the 'high command'. Jayanthi Natarajan's resignation confirms that all revolts of principle, in this milieu, begin after someone ends up sidelined.2. As the Congress's fortunes continue to decline, more and more of its top-rung leaders will begin to develop a conscience, including some who continue to remain in the inner circle but who feel there is no political sense in remaining within the party.3. The same process may also get underway in smaller regional parties where the Bharatiya Janata Party is trying to carve a bigger role for itself. Defections are possible from the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha, for example, or the Trinamool in Bengal or even the Akali Dal in Punjab.4. The likelihood of strategic defections is directly proportional to the BJP's ability to deliver credible threats about past misdemeanours being probed by agencies like the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate. Here, it is significant to note reports that Natarajan met with Amit Shah in December 2014. 5. The Congress party, which initially saw great political value in defending the rights of the adivasis and farmers against companies that had environmentally-dodgy projects, made a switch towards the end of its tenure when it saw virtually the whole of Corporate India backing the BJP. Natarajan's letter captures this U-turn made by Rahul Gandhi very well. It is a different story that the Congress's change of tack did not cut any ice with large industrial donors.6. The process  of environmental clearances needs to be cleaned up so that rent-seeking opportunities by politicians, bureaucrats and companies are ended. The Modi government says it is doing precisely that but the method it has chosen - of dismantling or diluting many requirements - is very much an over-correction. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

You can't be so apologetic of Congress-I after this lame reasoning.<br/><br/>
Everyone knew that the snoop gate was Congress-I propaganda; Stopped reading your OpEd after that. <br/><br/>
The larger question should be when media crooks will have their conscience back.

                            Congress achievements:-<br/><br/>
1. Power without accountability<br/>
2. Discrediting Prime Minister's Office and his authority <br/>
3. Most likely indulged in corrupt activities by taking bribes for approvals - This ministry was a mere tollgate on behalf of high command<br/>
4. Excessive Sycophancy may not yield results<br/>
5. Finally, no credible leaders find Congress going to survive in the future<br/>
6. Congress Mukth Bharath - achieved!

                            Rats leaving a sinking ship!!.When you belong to a party you are supposed to be loyal to the party  and its leader...If you feel opposed to the functioning of the leadership all the right-thinking people should get together and set right the course....course correction....Instead if you run immediately to the opposite party and betray your own ,how can you have any self respect left.....Bjp rss,vhp are all parties one has to be wary of....they have blood on their hands...and are full of lies . cunning and nefarious methods.They go acourting Jayalalitha who is a criminal indicted for swindling TN , and many who hold highest positions in Bjp are all indicted .out on bail and one by one they are acquited on some ptetext.So its a party with no morals <br/>
So Do not trust BJP.Try to reform your poarty and rejuvenate it .Its a party which got us our Independence and it cares for all Indians equally.

                            Interesting opinion, or should one say tepid writing just to cover himself (Varadarajan) so he does not get called for being a Congress tattu.  It was also interesting to see how Mr. Varadarajan lay more blame on Ms. Jayanthi and no blame on Mr. Rajiv Gandhi or Smt. Soniya Gandhi.  Also interesting how he brings in Mr. Modi when Ms. Jayanthi's letter had to do with her experiences in the Congress party, boy Mr. Varadarajan seems to be obsessed with Mr. Modi.  And finally, had someone from the BJP written such a letter about Mr. Modi, Mr. Varadarajan would have been screaming, probably literally, I told you so.  <br/><br/>
This is the last opinion of Mr.Varadarajan that I will be reading since he does not seem to be an intellectual to me, just a Congress Tattu.

                            Absolutely as indicated there might be many in the regional parties too who will follow Natrajan/Binny/Shazia/100+ before that but in long run in this AGE OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION where people are not more aware this will damage the NATION very disastrously.

                            Siddharth Varadarajan and people like Pavan Verma and that marathi journalist, whats his name.....ah! Kumar Ketkar all have one thing in common.......they have never seen a tarazu (balance) in their otherwise biased lives! So there should not be too much importance given to people like these. They are best ignored or otherwise, treated like dirt! I am not for a minute saying that BJP has only saints in their party, but the unmistakable hatred to any other party other than the congress in these men mentioned above makes one feel that these people are in the wrong profession. There is freedom of speech in our Constitution, not dirty and biased speech!

                            I just was listening to the audio of Rahul Gandhi's Speech and there was nothing really wrong. He clearly stated that Some projects are held back for good reasons and some because of administrative delays. Isnt that a fact?

                            Jayanthi was elected to Rajya Sabha for 4 times.  She &amp; Chidambaram left the congress with Moopanar in 1996and formed their own party.  She has been in the congress for the last three decades, but could not win the election even once.  Over and above, she was not able to make any contribution for the party's support base in Tamil Nadu for the last three decades.  She has been in the Delhi politics and has been enjoying all the fruits of power only by pleasing the Gandhi family. Oherwise, she has noting to claim or project by herself, other than her forefathers. If she was acting against her conscience, she should have long ago left the Ministry and congress party, ever since she was pressurized to take decisions against the oath of office.  Now, at the age of 60+  she has realized that Congress is not going to come back to power in the near future, consequently she feel like a fish out of water.  She is playing her card steadily, by paving the way to enter into BJP. Othewise, there was no reason to talk about "SNOOPGATE". Or, should we assume that no other wrong doing was done apart the issues stipulated in her letter to Sonia Gandhi.  I am sure, within few months now, she will join BJP.  BJP also want some one with her stature in Tamil Nadu for their party. <br/>
Every thing is politics.  Dear politicians, you all are trying  to fool the common man of this country, for the sake of power and money.  But, don't think that the IQ of common man  is lower than yours. We will teach you all proper lesson at the appropriate time.

                            The Jayanthi Natarajan expose reveals that India despite liberalisations from the early 1990s, has retained the License Permit raj in its worst form through 'Environmental Clearnce' ministry.<br/>

                            Jayanthi's long letter and the author's shortlisted six points add up to just one thing we all knew all the time. Congress, particularly its present top leadership,  is 'hypocrisy' personified and shamelessly and brazenly does what it faults other parties for, whether it is the much touted but cheaply exploited cloak of secularism or the holier than thou mantle of "honesty".

                            Jayanti Natarajan is a accused of coming forward only when she was sidelined. What is so unusual? It happens everywhere. In corporate life, it is so common. Even in Hindu it should be that.  So much of bickering happened in Hindu. All said, it is clear that a lot of money is involved in clearances.Ratan Tata said a politician wanted Rs. 15 crore for their airline to come in.  It is no news.

                            Little wonder that rahul overruled almost everything good or bad, usually bad, his govt did. If he had called the action or the ordinance of the Prime Minister as "nonsense," what could stop him from discrediting cabinet ministers. There could be some semblance of truth in Jayanthi's version, although the timing and intent could be a real suspect.
