Headline::::Dear Liberals, Hold Onto Those Awards



DateTime::::2015-10-22T00:00:00+05:30




                                The writers and artists who have returned their awards to protest a few murders allegedly by the Hindu right: what will they do when things get much worse?
People do extreme things when their anguish is not being heard. They shout, they scream, they threaten violence and self-harm, they throw shoes and ink on other people's faces. The returning of awards represents not just a strong expression of protest, but also a sense of exasperation over not being heard.
Every liberal complains the liberal space is shrinking, the fringe is going mainstream. Eminent historian Romila Thapar says liberals must speak up, public intellectuals should be more visible, not cede space. This is ironic because the right complains that liberals and leftist intellectuals have a monopoly over the public discourse in India, that they have too much voice, control over too many institutions.
Here is how I see it: the left/liberal/radical speak, but they are not heard. These are two different things.
The liberal space in India began shrinking much before Narendra Modi became Prime Minister. It has continued shrinking because the liberals are not speaking, but rather because the liberals have utter contempt for mass communication. Our public intellectuals are rather too private. The liberal intelligentsia is unable to shed its Brahminical arrogance.
In her essay The Public Intellectual in India, Romila Thapar complains about the circus that our TV news channels have become. They are shouting matches. Whether we like it or not, these shouting matches are defining the public discourse in India today, as indeed in much of the world. You won't see too many left-liberal intellectuals, there because they refuse to participate. They think they are boycotting an evil medium, but what they are doing is ceding public space. "There are two kinds of people who refuse to appear on our channel," a TV producer once told me, "intellectuals and Congressmen."
Ok, to expect serious intellectuals to attend the Arnab Goswami court could be a bit much. But that's not all. The Indian left has a historical problem with mass communication, and its boycott of TV news is only one example.
Returning his Sahitya Akademi award, Hindi writer Kashinath Singh said that Chetan Bhagat is a "bazaru" or populist writer. He compared Bhagat to writer Gulshan Nanda, whose novels were turned into Hindi films in the 1970s, saying that Nanda was never taken seriously as a writer.
Not everybody has to write popular fiction, but I bet we won't see a left-liberal Chetan Bhagat anytime soon. Singh uses the word "bazaru" derogatorily, but I'm sure even exalted writers go to the bazaar for shopping. The bazaar gives you whatever is in demand, and also creates demand with new and attractive goods the masses would like. The bazaar is where the public comes together, chats and makes new friends, exchanges ideas and information. It is crucial to the public sphere. Our public intellectuals, however, not only want to shun the bazaar of ideas to create high art, but are also not apologetic over insulting everything that is popular.
This political and cultural vanguardism of the Indian left is a hangover of the Communist era. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and our leftists slowly became post-communists, but the bad hangover stays. The left sees the poor as its "constituency" and sees the middle class as right-wing by definition. It no longer engages with the poor because it has resigned itself to the failure of communism. As for the growing middle class, it can never deign to have a dialogue with those bazaru people, those capitalism-loving, mall-going petty bourgeoisie.
The average Indian left-liberal had, for years, great contempt for the internet, dismissing it as the medium of the elite. Today she has upgraded herself but to little avail. Earlier the left-liberal use to run little magazines, today they run small blogs and websites, starting their little fights over who's more radical. They complain about online abuse from the right, and they wring their hands over click-baiting headlines, and shudder at the thought of getting too many hits. The fewer people that read them, the more successful they think their intellectual exercise has been. There is no intent to engage with the wider public, because the subaltern can't speak and the bourgeoisie doesn't deserve to be spoken to.
The liberals can blame TV news for being a shouting match, but they can't blame the Hindu right for dominating the political discourse on the internet. The Hindu right saw in the internet a great opportunity to speak directly to the middle class youth and convert them. The left-liberal isolates itself here as well.  
To see Hindutva online discourse merely in terms of the abuse it comes with is to be reductive. It is the conscious strategy of the Hindu right online to reply everything, to win every argument, settle every debate in their favour. You will see them attack the liberal spaces with (often abusive) responses, but you will rarely see left-liberals responding with the same alacrity.
The best example of the left-liberal attitude towards mass communication was its response to the Jan Lokpal movement that later became the Aam Aadmi Party. While the movement was seeking to mobilise diverse sections of society, our left-liberals were busy fulminating over its lack of radical purity. While Narendra Modi was sharpening his knives for the 2014 election, our left-liberals were busy attacking the Lokpal movement day in and day out. It was a time when they were not silent, they were not unheard. Their derision of the Lokpal movement was driven only partly by the misplaced fear that it would help the BJP by attacking the Congress. It was driven as much, if not more, by the contempt they have for the masses. For them, there is only one way the masses should be mobilised, which is by following a peasant movement they would lead.  
The Lokpal movement resulted in a party that may have its own problems, problems that it owes to the nature of mainstream politics in India; yet even today, the liberals are unwilling to admit that the Lokpal movement showed it is still possible to have mass mobilization, and enter mainstream politics, without being Hindutva.
Today, a new left is emerging. You see it in the Pink Chaddi campaign, you see it in a YouTube video where a young woman sings a rap song against a corporation, you see it in young professionals taking on the Hindu right on Twitter. This is a left that will not seek permission from the old guard that's busy decimating itself. These are not people who will care whether the fuddy-duddies think they are bazaru. They don't have the Communist hangover to shake-off. Give them time, they will speak, and be heard.(Shivam Vij is a journalist in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Dear Rip Van Winkles, Why did you not wake up when unbelievable corruption by and under the auspices of your darlings, the relics of the dynasty, was taking the nation to dogs? You now want to return your awards which were anyway gathering dust on your shelves because incidents as different and far from each other as attacks on writers and a murder by individuals in a village in a backward state governed by a succession of corrupt, "secular" dispensations. With this kind of "logic" and ignorance, one wonders why you were given literary awards, in the first place.

                            What is the need for left-liberal (LL) approach anymore. LL intellectuals in India have thoroughly dis-credited themselves by their  selective outrage on issues and propensity to look down upon the common man. The common men (or women) see the fallacy in LL when their views do not match on issues like moral policing or some religious issues. One good example of this dis-connect was the episode of Khidki ext. in AAP rule 1. AAP is as left as you can get but the LL took a very different view on ideological grounds to what AAP was doing. AK went to Varanasi and was seen taking a devotional dip in the Ganges, will any LL be caught on camera doing this?<br/>
I am not holding any brief for the AAP, and AAP has shown itself to be ideologically confused and going against its founding principles. LL have lost relevance as their political and social formulations are based on some very wrong assumptions.

                            It needs no wisdom to say that the left as well as the Congress, the latter because of alleged scandals, cede space to the extreme right wing during the last election and for a period post elections. This had made the right extremely confident to the point of hubristic , rumbustious and big bully under the impression that the universe had settled in their favour. As inefficacy of the government, mini scandals and major improprieties are being uncovered the sheen is off the much touted government. Social media has been reading more from the left and the left of centre in the last six months or so. Hence there is no need for despondency . The extreme and non-syncretic right will, hopefully,  get hoisted by its own petard

                            What you are basically saying is that left leaning people are Champagne socialists. I agree. I don't know where it started, but left leaning people are always seen as "intellectual class". I am a scientist, and I have never heard an intelligent utterance from a socialist. As a scientist, I believe strongly in Evolution - some how that is roped in under "rightist view". Let me remind the leftists that nature is amoral. That is, nature is right-winged. Oh, have I said some thing controversial to unsettle your cold Champagne?

Chetan bhagat is trying hard to be neutral, even then he is viewed as bjp spokesman. Without responding to the points he made, brigade wants to attack him, that shows the desperation than intellect! Stop calling them intellectuals.

Dear Rip Van Winkles, Why did you not wake up when monumental corruption by and under the auspices of your darling relics of the dynasty took the country to dogs? Now you want to return your awards, which were anyway gathering dust on your shelves for incidents as varied and far apart as attacks on writers (and where were you when a Bangladeshi writer was chased from pillar to post?)and murder of an individual in a backward state ruled by a succession of incredibly corrupt, "secular" dispensations. With this kind of "logic" and ignorance, one wonders whether you ever deserved literary awards in the first place.

                            The author has got it right.  The award returners are the self appointed guardians of the nation's conscience!  Well, I have news for them!  They are not my nation's conscience!  They live in a world of their own!  Where was Nayantara when Priyanka and her mummy Sonia tried to get Natwar Singh to stop his book merely because it sought to tell the truth?  The truth exposed Sonia for the hypocrite that she was!  She had no inner or indeed outer voice telling her not to accept the PM's post!  As far as I am concerned, the award returners can get lost.  They have never contributed to the country's good, they have been selfish and when they are regarded as irrelevant in a new aspirational India, like little babies they have thrown their toys out of their prams.  I will most certainly make it a point to never ever read anything they write.

Incidents of violence is sad and many times inhuman however this is not happening first time. Only difference is now Modi is in power. <br/><br/>
The same people in past has shown no action or words against such incidents but were very selective not to say anything against terrorism.<br/><br/>
These people are cowards who has no principle , many of them got awards due to proximity with politicians in past, now they are paying back as the same politicians are in back sit

                            Just to clarify, Romila Thapar has refused to take any government sponsored award through her career; whether Congress or BJP. So call her anything, but she was never patronized by the Congress. She is a historian of global repute; that doesn't come with Congress patronage. <br/><br/>
She is the Tendulkar among Historians of Ancient India; even those who disagree with her respect her. Except of course, Hindutva propagandists who can't find space within the intelligentsia across the globe anywhere. <br/><br/>
The question Right-Wing intellectuals should ask is: Why are right wing economists like Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati given space and respect in India as well as globally; but right-wing historians, cultural theorists, sociologists and political scientists not taken seriously at all anywhere? <br/><br/>
It is because no one is accepted for justifying Fascism and minority-baiting in intellectual circles across the world; and historians among their own community induct those who have a certain standing and rigour in their work which the Right-Wing Historians don't have. That is why they keep ranting against Thapar etc. Match them; don't yell at them! If you don't believe me, check right-wing historians and see their global standing.

                            Poor articles. First of all take of your shades unless you are blind. Secondly returning awards is a sign of protest. These people personify the awards and not the other way round. When the things get worse these people would still lead the public. Doesn't matter if they still have that trophy or not. They will in fact be better recognized as leaders because the people of India  will remember that these individuals gave up the big rewards which was once a highlight of their career.

Then theirs Shoba De whose only contribution to the society has been, errr, can't find anything after much research. These people want to call the shots in the country. Why ? Why do you want to control the lives of people around you ? What quality you have displayed to be given such authority ? What has been your contribution to the nation ? Absolutely nothing. And these intellectuals want to control the nation. Huh. Get lost. No one's interested in you. Run away and go to US and settle there. This is what most of NRIs have done.

                            Shivam Vij, your writing reeks of misplaced arrogance. It would do you and our work well to be less inflated with hot air.

                            Reality is these pseudo intellectuals are becoming less and less relevant. For years they benefited from the alms doled out by their political masters. Now they are crying foul as these privileges are being withdrawn. It's a fact that many of these 'eminent' writers and artists have not vacated government accommodations even decades after they were required to vacate them.

                            Rightly said. These so-called intellectuals speak only antagonism to become popular. Their main aim of writing is not to make proud of things followed in good sense, not to respect the feeling of mass and not to eradicate the superficial thing.  But to become popular writer to get award from congress government and earn life-long royalty. These handful of people try to arm twist popular government and majority community feeling. They blame RSS as right wing but they are not having any right sense.

                            I don't understand why several people are calling this article poorly written. Poorly written compared to what? If you don't agree with the view expressed in the piece that does not make it poorly written. I for one thought the article was well written and reasoned. I don't agree with everything the author says but that's the nature of opinion pieces. I wish more of us, opinion makers, social media users, members of the anonymous peanut gallery, could be more moderate in our positions and accept that both forces, those of the left and the right, are necessary not only to keep each other in check but also to make sure that our progress as a nation is not too lopsided.

                            Hey, it is not "petty bourgeoisie", it is "petite bourgeoisie". Don't mix French and English or slang French for an English language article; follow a standard dictionary than "Bazaru" Wikipedia. Take an English lesson first. Poor linguistic review of an article to be published by a national level news channel justifies why somebody called you guys "bazaru"!!!!!!

                            I don't know why we put with such inanities by an imbecile like Shivam Vij. <br/>
First, liberal /= (is not) left<br/>
Secondly, a lot among the people who returned the awards have no strong political leaning or allegiance to a political ideology, leave aside communism.<br/>
And lastly, many public intellectuals have appeared on television and written on print and digital media about the shrinking liberal space. <br/>
This is very trashy stuff.

                            Its not that the liberal refuses to speak due to his contempt for mass communication. The mainstream media has become a prisoner of profit and that is why it offers no space for the liberal to speak up. Its the mainstream media in every country that drives the quality of public discourse. By being held hostage to the profit motive the media drives down the quality of discourse in this country. Those aren't my views alone but the views of an eminent journalist P Sainath

                            "People do extreme things when their anguish is not being heard. They shout, they scream, they threaten violence and self-harm, they throw shoes and ink on other people's faces. The returning of awards represents not just a strong expression of protest, but also a sense of exasperation over not being heard."<br/><br/>
If Shivam Viz could, he would probably claim that the killing in Dadri and the lynching of Muslim men on pretext of cow slaughter too is some form of protest. It is ridiculous to equate even remotely the eminent writers returning their awards in protest over the government's acquiescence in allowing the killings to go on with the thuggish acts of the Hindutva goons who go about throwing ink or unleashing violence on people who do not agree with them.<br/><br/>
Shivam Vij was never known for any analytical brilliance, but here, he lost whatever little credibility he has.<br/><br/>
"The best example of the left-liberal attitude towards mass communication was its response to the Jan Lokpal movement that later became the Aam Aadmi Party. While the movement was seeking to mobilise diverse sections of society, our left-liberals were busy fulminating over its lack of radical purity. While Narendra Modi was sharpening his knives for the 2014 election, our left-liberals were busy attacking the Lokpal movement day in and day out. It was a time when they were not silent, they were not unheard. Their derision of the Lokpal movement was driven only partly by the misplaced fear that it would help the BJP by attacking the Congress. It was driven as much, if not more, by the contempt they have for the masses. For them, there is only one way the masses should be mobilised, which is by following a peasant movement they would lead." <br/><br/>
Shivam Vij would like us to believe that just because something appeared to have 'popular mass support', everyone has to be stampeded into supporting it. I have myself been brutally critical of India's 'left liberal elite' and their ineffectual politics, but their incisive criticism of the Jan Lokpal Movement cannot be faulted. Their refusal to indulge in political opportunism cannot be blamed as a sin. The IAC and the Jan Lokpal movement received a large covert support from the Hindutva Rightwing and that was how it appeared to be a mass movement. There was more anti-Congress support of the Hindutva variety in it than genuine desire for a corruption free India. IAC/Jan Lok Pal Movement did play the role of the hatchet men of the Hindutva Right whether knowingly or unknowingly. <br/><br/>
The questions arise, if indeed it had such mass support, why has the movement fizzled out? Were the goals of the movement achieved? If not, why is it no where to be seen or heard now?<br/><br/>
There are more serious questions. Where is the icon of the Jan Lok Pal movement now, around which the "masses" apparently rallied? Have we heard from him about Dadri? Or the Dalit killings? No? Why?<br/><br/>
What fancy activists/journalists of the Shivam Vij of course forgets is that even a massacre like Nellie 1983 at a point of time had 'mass support'. And it was a handful of left liberals like my father who risked their lives to stand up and call out as genocide. In contrast, those like Shivam Vij has not risked even a sliver of their skin for anything in life. So much for pontificating to the left.<br/><br/>
"Today, a new left is emerging. You see it in the Pink Chaddi campaign, you see it in a YouTube video where a young woman sings a rap song against a corporation, you see it in young professionals taking on the Hindu right on Twitter. This is a left that will not seek permission from the old guard that's busy decimating itself. These are not people who will care whether the fuddy-duddies think they are bazaru. They don't have the Communist hangover to shake-off. Give them time, they will speak, and be heard." <br/><br/>
Fancy dudes like Shivam Vij believe India's new left is emerging from the urban elite. It is apparent from the references to the new left he makes. The problem is that, they hardly ever haul their asses to places outside Delhi or metros. India's new left is actually quietly rising village-by-remote village. It is us who are building it. No, it doesn't seek any approval from the old guard either. But they are Marxists without mouthing the jargon or the slogans the trendy urban elite is used to. They don't need to learn how to build a formidable new left from armchair analysts.

                            Returning the awards has reduced the system to be farce. An abject surrender to one class of policy n politics. It's directed against Modiji n incitement of non cooperation against development n system  change. Its being partially aligned to some n alienment to progress. A message of impending failure of democracy n electoral verdicts. The opposition should have been for those flouting lawn order. It should have been directed to prompt state Govt asking for protection. A misdirected misdiagnosed misdemeanours.
