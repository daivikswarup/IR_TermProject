Headline::::Mani-Talk: Where is the FDI, Modi?



DateTime::::2015-01-05T14:50:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)The Government of India's official, routine Mid-Year Economic Analysis has just been published - and a more damning indictment of Modi's economic policies would be hard to find. Not only has there been little development, all his energies seem to be directed at clandestinely pushing the extremists in his ranks to redouble with vigour their not-so-well-hidden agenda of precipitately pushing the country down the abyss of Hindutva.GDP growth is negligible - all of Modi's rhetoric has pushed up the rate by no more than an unimpressive 0.6 per cent. Even that is the consequence of the last gasp of the previous government whose efforts were just beginning to take effect when the Government changed and Modi was able to ride the tail wind. Gross value added in agriculture and allied activities is actually down - by an entire percentage point; the index of industrial production has gone up by a mere 2.8 per cent; and exports have collapsed from a growth rate of 15.2 per cent to a dreadful 6.7 per cent. The exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar is today the lowest ever in the history of our benighted country.  The Sensex may have soared to heights never before attained but that is principally on account of two factors: one, the Modi government having given up its efforts to bring back black money (thus reneging on a core election commitment) and winking at the perennial round-tripping of fresh black money through the Mauritius route, thus making speculation on the stock market the main engine of "growth " in our country. So, Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) floods in, mostly from Mauritius, but it is unreliable "hot money" that enters or exits the economy at the press of a computer button. The real McCoy, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which is a genuine growth engine, shies away from India because real investors know that Modi's claims are bogus and the economy will stagnate under him at 5-6 per cent, no more, perhaps less.The Economic Analysis tells us that over the six-year period 2005-2011, the average growth rate of GDP was nearly 9 per cent annum. It fell thereafter to below 6 per cent, but Jaitley has his work cut out for him to restore the UPA-I growth rate. Recovery had already begun in the latter phase of UPA-II, but all Modi has been able to do is not fall below. There are no signs of the economy accelerating towards the growth rates with which Dr. Manmohan Singh had wowed the world. What then is there to celebrate? Inflation, certainly. But that has nothing to do with the exertions of Arun Jaitley. International oil prices have plunged thanks to a combination of four factors: low to negative growth rates in the developed West; bear sentiment in the New York Metals Exchange; the steep rise in domestic shale oil and shale gas production in the US that has reduced their petroleum imports to virtually nil; and sanctions against the Russian Federation for the people of Crimea having had the temerity to vote in favour of  leaving the Ukraine to rejoin Russia. Plus, of course, OPEC's decision to keep their oil output at pre-crash levels instead of attempting to keep oil prices higher by cutting back on production. And El Nino having at the last minute decided to by-pass India. So, the silver lining has everything to do with the global sun peeking out from behind the black cloud and almost nothing to do with the black cloud backing off from the Indian economic horizon.Indeed, the Mid-Year Economic Analysis confirms that UPA-II was punished for its economic woes just as its Herculean efforts to arrest the downslide were coming to fruition. The general index of consumer prices had steeply fallen from its September 2013 high of  11 per cent to below 8 per cent three months later, while food inflation fell over the same period from 14 per cent to below 10 per cent. The trend has continued.While Modi has received extended applause for his "Make in India" slogan, that is all it has remained - a slogan. No one is making in India, not domestic investors, not foreign investors. No one explains this better than the Mid-Year Economic Analysis that deserves quotation in full: "Growth in real capital formation was around 15 per cent and private corporate investment surged, East Asia-style, over a very short period from 6.5 per cent in 2003-04 to 17.3 per cent in 2007-08, amounting to an increase of nearly 11 percentage points of GDP. Investment was based largely on the perception that growth rates of 8.5 per cent would continue indefinitely and banks, especially public sector banks, could lend to private sector investors in infrastructure." (para 1.43)That is, indeed, a true picture of the economy under UPA-I. Then came the delayed impact on India of the global downturn:"As the growth boom faded, projects turned sour, leaving a legacy of distressed assets. This stock problem is weighing down assets and hence investment. The problem is compounded by weak institutions." (para 1.44)So, what is Modi doing? Weakening our institutions even further! Ordinances galore are weakening Parliamentary institutions that are the very foundation of our democracy. Hitler did the same thing - only by a different route. Immediately on coming to office through the democratic route, he got the German Reichstag (Parliament) to pass the Enabling Act that enabled him to rule by decree. Modi too is ruling by decree, not Parliamentary consent. Fortunately, ours is a seven-decade old, established democracy and, therefore, unlike the short-lived Weimar constitution that Hitler overthrew, capable of surviving Modi's assault on its sanctity. But as we turn the New Year, the country is beginning to realize that it has been taken for a long ride of which the foredoomed failure to bring back black money is but symptomatic. The Government is clearly clueless about how to tackle the fundamental malaise that afflicts the economy - the inability of the private corporate sector to rise above governmental sops to display some entrepreneurial spirit. What our businessmen are good at is leveraging their influence with those whom they helped with monetary donations to elect to power. They use this influence to squeeze more and more concessions out of government so that, through rent-seeking rather than 'animal spirits', they are able to salt away their gains. Yet, it is on the backs of this private sector that Modi hopes to play out his take on Margaret Thatcher. His chances of success are exactly the same as those of a snow-drop in the furnace.

                            Mani, We the people have given BJP the chance this time since you folks screwed it up for the past 10 years. If they dont deliver we will give it to the next best choice in 2019. If that choice has to be Congress, better start acting as a constructive opposition and stop opposition for the sake of it. And for heaven sake, get mummy, beti, beta, damaad combination out of Congress. We like Congress but we hate the 'family'. Do something about it and build good leaders within your party.

And for this too he doesn't have any logic but simply use pen, put words and believe that he is wring truth and all people would believe.<br/><br/>
Person who lost his deposit in last election and came 6th (not even runner up) criticizing man who brought majority government on his own after 30 big years..!<br/><br/>
* O.6% increase in GDP due to late UPA policy - If UPA Policy gave result after 10 years than how current government's policy is going to result in 10 months? His own logic confused here.<br/><br/>
* He talks about average GDP growth. Who would make him understand that GDP -only final year growth counts not average. To get admission in college - your 12th standard marks / result would count; not average of std.1 to std.12. UPA government brings down GDP growth from 8.5% (it got from Vajpayee governmetn) to 4.0% (when UPA left)<br/><br/>
* All major credit rating agencies improving India's rating after new government but this joker saying opposite to it just because he hates someone..!<br/><br/>
* And yes Mr. Mani - do your own wife listen to you any time? Even she doesn't listen to you than why people of India would listen to you?

                            Gandhi family stooges / chamachas like MS Aiyar had started asking questions within just 1-2 months of Modi rule, completely forgetting their 'masters' dismal performance during their regime. Their masters never even opened their mouths in parliament and they want answers from Modi in parliament. Poor Manmohan Singh was not empowered to talk. Sonia Gandhi used to tell others to speak and she herself used to remain silent. Rahul Gandhi in his entire 10 year period only once 'read out' a speech in parliament. And these chamachas of Gandhis want Modi to reply.

Mr Mani, please look within yourself and your parties rule for last 10 years before judging NDA, one thing is for sure you guys are not coming back....One more point. The High rate of GDP you harbouring about you got in the UPA 1 time, please remeber the same logic applies to you. What NDA had left you were only riding the wave. You think we are not seeing what you guys are doing in Rajya Sabha...opposing the same bills you guys bought in ...opposition for the sake of it...Not sure if I should call you Anti Nationals, but yes definitely Anti Poor and Anti Progress. Kudos, keep doing what you are doing and next election you will be only writing as a guest not as a congress man, because there wont be any.

                            A New Year, a newly invigorated Moron Shankar Aiyar.  People involved in serious discourse would not have expected anything less from this putrid retainer of the of the Nehru-Gandhi parivar that colonised India when the British left.Thevery fact that his leaders, the boy wonder Rahul and the expert on waitressing, Sonia are largely absent from the country says it all.  They would not be able to understand economics and consequently would not be able to explain economics.  Cambridge educated Moron obviously thinks he can.  Sadly, all that valuable foreign exchange expended on this moron was wasted.  Simple facts:It takes years before FDI comes to fruition and Modi has not had 1 year.  There is the feasibility study, the world and local economic and political outlook, the purchase and development of premises, personnel training and various other factors to be considered.  But then again this moron wouldn't understand; he has never been a businessman in his life; he has merely lived off them!  What he is good at is have a junior moron to do some superficial research and come up with a few statistics he then spends time distorting and putting his own spin upon!  There also has to be the standard reference to a figure of Hitler to add 'masala' to this  character's tome whenever reference is made to Modi.  As far as ordinance is concerned, does he take us for fools?  The whole world and his wife saw thuggish behaviour of the likes of another retainer of the 'settlor' parivar, Anand Sharma an his new best friend, 'Communist without a Cause' Yecuri.  Sharma was barking(literally) upthe wrong tree.  This diatribe against Modi may be summed up thus:  Moron Shankar Aiyer wants the world and his wife to believe that Congress did so well and got things so right that they lost the election!Perhaps moron is too mild a description for this character.

                            These ppl passed a whole lot of legislation from food security to land acquisition just before their term ended, leaving a host of fiscal challenges for next govt. Chidambaram would never have got 6%+ growth from 2004 in such kind of legislative challenges. Even MNREGA expense was very high, worse was Chidambaram pushing 50000 crore + fiscal deficit to next year.

                            there are few things that need immediate attention:<br/><br/>
- 	education should be for everybody and should be made free (for next 25 years) for childrens of all the people who come under BPL and have 2 or less kids.<br/>
-	education system should focus on morality, creativity &amp; patriotism<br/>
-	people should be encouraged to walk and use public transport as much as possible to reduce pollution<br/>
-	there should be a rule such that students who are studying in the institutes that are funded by tax payer's money have to work atleast for 5 years within India<br/>
-	fresh water reservoirs should be created throughout the country with a gap of max 2-4 kms between each other and then maintained. Trees should be planted close to these water reservoirs and also throughout the cities<br/>
-	the income generated by the people who break traffic rules should be given completely to the traffic police who collect them...and similar thing should be done for income tax officers as well. This will encourage both traffic police and income tax officers to work much more honestly.<br/>
-	the your enterpreneurs should be encouraged so that our market is not completely dominated by foreign companies<br/>
-	there should be a seperate judiciary for rape cases with a deadline of 1 year for justice<br/>
-	tax system should be simplified and should be collected from everybody. I don't know if this will work but maybe there should be tax only on the purchases and should be collected from the manufacturers for both vendor's &amp; customer's purchase...so that manufacturer could add that much price to the product and then sell to the vendors and then vendor should sell to customer with the exact marked price. This way govt only has to track &amp; chase the manufacturers<br/>
-	government procedures should be made as much as online as possible so that there are lesser chances of bribe...although this one is quite difficult to be implemented as poor people don't have a reach to this at the moment<br/><br/>
If we implement above things then we would see our country changing in next 2 decades and we will die in a developed &amp; strong country.

1, You said a CHAIWALLA will never become a PM of India in its History. Now, what is the answer you gonna give for that? <br/><br/>
2, So, before SIX months how many make in India projects has been raised by the Congress Govt? You never worried about the country's progress, you never worried when Pakistan attacked India, you never worried when China attacked India, you never worried when Indian fisherman's were attacked by Sri lankans. You never worried during all these crucial times and you worried when "RAHUL GANDHI" resigned his post from the CONGRESS after the election result?  <br/><br/>
Please advise us, as we the people of INDIA wanna hear the answers from you for the above queries!!!

If your party still allows you to be a spokesperson, then please direct your questions then and we can have a healthy debate. You had 60 years and recently 10 years. I did not see any questions at all being posed during those 10 years even about a word called FDI. We are tired of people who dream of becoming economists overnight, and raise stupid questions, after sleeping for 10 years. Please you can't fool people all the time. Kindly let others do their jobs.

All this crap for the sake of opposing is in very poor taste. All the bad done by Congi and Gandhi Parivar is way beyond imagination and there is an honest effort to improve things. Just one question to you and your party ... for all the hype and hoopla that congress makes and claims that everything done by this govt is implementation of congi schemes .... was UPA able to get President of USA to India for a republic day ... this is symbolic of the stature Mr. Modi has and how he has got the country back on the World Map ....

                            I think Mani Shankar is correctly pointing towards the danger - over-dependence on crony-capitalism for revival of the economy and coupled with foreign investments the jobs would be assured thereby resulting in growth...but not turning out to be that hunky-dory and here the words of the RBI governor may be recollected - first you have to Make-for-India then you can think of Make-In-India...well the message that I conclude is only economic growth has to precede inward flow of foreign investment and not the other way round...which means we need to be self-sufficient in kickstarting our own economy from within and then investors will throw their money - one example is some of the ecommerce players have done extremely well like snapdeal.com which has resulted in venture capital flowing from Japan...but of course that was true entrepreneurship and not crony-capitalism like the Adanis !!
