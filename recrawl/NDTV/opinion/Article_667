Headline::::BJP, Why No Apology for Slander of Hamid Ansari?



DateTime::::2015-06-22T18:35:00+05:30




                                On a debate last night on NDTV in which I participated, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra refused to answer my question on abrasive statements  by Yogi Adityanath and Ram Madhav about non-practitioners of Yoga. Patra and Kiran Bedi, his colleague from the BJP, sought like other leaders from their party to dismiss the serious allegations by Ram Madhav; they suggested instead that  on International Yoga Day, it was the Guinness records and the broadcast message of peace that needed to be concentrated on.
True, it was these records that captured the imagination of most BJP spokespersons and leaders who were basking in the glory of the spectacle at Rajpath yesterday where thousands of citizens practiced Yoga with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
This while one of Modi's closest confidantes and BJP Secretary Ram Madhav took on the second citizen of India, Vice President Hamid Ansari, for not participating in International Yoga Day. Madhav,who made the transformation from the RSS to the BJP about a year ago, asked this question in all innocence if BJP spokespersons were to be believed.
He later tweeted that he was unaware that the VP was unwell and then deleted his tweet attacking the Vice-President.
Yes, Madhav's tweet was innocent, as innocent as his party MP Yogi Adityanath's statement that those whon did not wish to practice Surya Namaskar could go to Pakistan. The connotation here need not be explained - Ram Madhav's dig at the Vice President is not divorced from Mr Ansari's religion, this writer believes.
And Ram Madhav did not stop at this. He accused Rajya Sabha TV, the state-run broadcaster, of blacking out the live telecast of the Yoga Day event 'completely' despite it being run on taxpayers' money. The reason for the attack is that the Rajya Sabha TV channel's controlling authority is Hamid Ansari. However, Madhav's claims were soon contradicted by Gurdeep Singh Sappal, CEO of Rajya Sabha TV who wrote "Baseless rumours. RSTV not just did live telecast of Rajpath event. But also had 3 documentaries, 1 special report today on Yoga."
What Ram Madhav failed to tell us - which was clarified later by the Vice President's office - wasthat Hamid Ansari was in the best of health but was missing in attendance because the Ayush Ministry refused to extend him an invitation to the event at Rajpath. Since then, the government has said that it would be a breach of protocol to invite the Vice President to an event where the PM is the lead player.
This is not the first time that Hamid Ansari who holds one of the highest offices in India had to go through an embarrassing situation that is linked to his religion. On Republic Day, he had to face a humiliating barrage of questions on his patriotism when he did not salute the national flag. Again those who questioned Hamid Ansari and his patriotism must read Section VI of the flag code of India. Hamid Ansari was a true nationalist as he followed protocol which demands "During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the Flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute." Basically, the main dignitary (in this case, the President) takes the salute; the others need to stand in attention.
Ansari did the right thing, but not for "nationalists"in India who used the term "Jihadi" and "Pakistani"for him on social media and other fora.
This time, it was not social media, but one of the senior-most members of the BJP, Ram Madhav, who questioned the patriotism of Hamid Ansari. I do not need to be diplomatic here but state in as many terms that Ansari was targeted by virtue of his faith. The BJP did not just make a gimmick of Yoga by turning it into a one-time spectacle like the Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan but has made the compulsory practice of Yoga in educational institutions a yardstick to judge the loyalty of the people to the Indian state.
The BJP reduced a beautiful spiritual exercise into a  measure of the nationalism and patriotism of its citizens. It wanted the event to be an exercise in which chest-thumping caricatures would perform the Surya Namaskar to prove their allegiance  to the Indian state, a flawed idea which the Indian right-wing and the government seem to be endorsing overtly and covertly.
Why is it that none of us questioned Home Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for not saluting the national flag on Republic Day, but were aghast at Ansari's alleged transgression? Why does the burden of proving nationalism and patriotism lie only on Hamid Ansari and not other (Hindu) leaders?
Perhaps Ram Madhav answered the question himself yesterday and the unfortunate truth is that none of the BJP leaders will condemn him for humiliating the highest office in India.
The 'un-patriotic' citizens of this country who have had to bear the humiliation of being called "haraamzaade" by another BJP MP  were asked to leave for Pakistan by Yogi Adityanath as Pakistan is seen to be the land which Indian Muslims hold allegiance to. And this unfortunate myth-making will continue to be given credence , proof of which was given to the country when Hamid Ansari stood humiliated last night. Sorry to say this BJP, but true to our apprehensions, you turned  International Yoga Day into an exercise not in pluralism but communalism. And we as proud, patriotic citizens of this country are ashamed that you proved true to our apprehensions.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            Living in west I feel blacks and coloured people restrain themselves from playing victim card but people of certain religion can never stop playing victim card. This shows problem with people of that particular religion and not rest of the world. Entire world will fail to satisfy this community. Now should rest of world change for this community or should this particular community stop blame game and learn to integrate.

                            Because he deserves it. The fact is he is a congress stooge and when former politicians take up such posts, it will raise all the right questions. It is also clear you and your community do not have respect or the decency to acknowledge the majority population and culture of the land. You always tend to show your ancestor's attitude, our north western neighbor's attitude. Maybe that's where you belong.

The Prime Minister and the BJP will win many more fans if Mr. Ram Madhav and Mr. Adithyanath and reprimanded. But the question is Will that happen? Mr. Ashok Malik has already tied himself in knots trying to give a spin to the episode.

Rana Ayyub has justification for Mr. Ansari for not saluting national flag but question when Modi refused to skull cup ..!<br/><br/>

                            The author was also complaining that students (30 each per school) were being asked to participate. But this happens for multiple Government events, not just Yoga day. It seems that there were protocol issues to call VP. Considering that some in the media were making a big issue about Yoga day, when a Hindu in Muslim country has hardly any rights, should they not be more gracious?

                            I agree Ram Madhav made a mistake and the govt should apologise to the VP.<br/><br/>
Why does Rana Ayub not write a article debunking the nonsense spewed by minority organisations &amp; Owaisi types when they refused to do Yoga saying it's hindutva? Why does she always write against BJP? Why doesn't she call the bluff of muslims when the govt said they are free to not chant OM while doing Yoga. Why doesn't Rana Ayub write and ask the muslims if doing Surya Namaskar &amp; Chanting OM converts them into hindu's then is Islam such a weak religion and if it is so weak then why maintain such a religion?!<br/><br/>
There are many questions and yes, BJP did NOT communalise Yoga. The minorities &amp; opposition did. They are the ones who started with we will not do this &amp; that. When you keep opposing everything giving the excuse of your religion then don't be shocked if people ask you to prove your nationalism &amp; patriotism. <br/><br/>
Bottom line is if you want to be considered as an Indian over a muslim, accept the country, it's culture &amp; traditions &amp; be proud of them. If you claim to be muslim and hence unable to do something then don't be shocked if you are always considered a muslim over an Indian. <br/><br/>
Give respect, get respect.<br/><br/>
Accept and get accepted.<br/><br/>
That's the circle of life.

Why do you see things so negatively on many issues which are part of Indian heritage.<br/>
We are educated enough (IIT and Ivy League educated ) to see the mediocrity and poisonous atmosphere you try to create on  many issues.<br/><br/>

                            You were tacitly opposed to yoga day by screaming that it was forced on many. Have you apologised for that false claim?

                            Another biased article from congress reward winning journalist. The beauty of her article is that they always criticise bjp regardless of whether they are in opposition or in govt.

                            While I absolutely agree that ram madhav should say sorry for the blunder, don't play victim card all the time for all problems your religion is going thru. 99% protests on yoga which is a non-religious event came from muslims. why don't you comment on that and communal politics of your community and seculars like you
