Headline::::National Holy Book? Perish the Thought!



DateTime::::2014-12-12T14:17:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)There are four problems with Sushma Swaraj's advocacy of the Bhagavad Gita as a "Rashtriya Granth", or "National Holy Book", as I have had occasion to tell her myself.The first is that to cite no less a source than Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, we already have a National Holy Book: it's called the Constitution of India.The second is that we are a land of multiple faiths, each of which has its own holy books; on what basis would we pick any one of them in the capacity of a National Holy Book? Which Sikh would put the Gita ahead of the Guru Granth Sahib, for instance?And if the answer to that question is, as Sushmaji suggests, that it is the holiest book of the overwhelming Hindu majority of our population, the proposition is contestable, like most things in Hindu philosophy. As a practising (and reasonably widely-read) Hindu myself, I find a lot of ideas in the Upanishads that are not in the Gita. I see Hinduism as a pluralistic faith of many holy books and many ways of worshiping the divine.You don't have to agree with those Hindu scholars who argue that the Gita, being Smriti (that which is heard and remembered, orally), is inferior to the Vedas and the Upanishads, which are Sruti (memorised and recorded divine revelation). But arguments about superiority and inferiority apart, there is no doubt that there are many views of the relative merits of several Indian holy books.Sushmaji, like Gandhiji before her, may be inspired by the Gita, but other, equally devout Hindus might have other preferences. Why not the Rig Veda, for instance, the primordial revelation text of the Hindu faith? Why not the Smriti text known as the Srimad Bhagavatam, or Bhagavata Purana, which is recited for an entire week (Saptaham) every year in many Hindu temples and homes?The quest to anoint a National Holy Book will not just divide Indians - it will divide Hindus as well.But it's the fourth problem that's most relevant to a political discussion of the issue. For a government minister to raise the idea of a National Holy Book serves to ignite not just controversy, but fears - fears of a majoritarian project that will slowly but surely erode India's "secular" - I prefer the word "pluralist" - identity and replace it with an overtly Hindu one.Signs of such inclinations have been accumulating since the BJP rode to power in May with an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. There has been the overt declaration by RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat that all Indians are Hindus, and by implication that those who do not consider themselves Hindus aren't actually Indian, and don't belong here. There's the statement by Giriraj Singh that those who don't vote for Modi should move to Pakistan, and the one by Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti that people are either followers of Rama or bastards (Ramzadon ya Haramzadon). Both these offenders have been rewarded with a place on Prime Minister Modi's council of ministers.There was the Shiv Sena MP shoving food down the throat of a fasting Muslim during Ramzan, and getting away without the slightest censure from the ruling NDA. There have been numerous incidents of communal violence, instigated for political purposes no doubt, but instilling fear in the targeted minorities. And now there is the episode of the mass conversion of 57 bewildered Bengali Muslims in Agra, through a mix of intimidation and inducement, under the Sangh Parivar's long-dormant "ghar wapasi" scheme.So Sushmaji's statement may well have been relatively innocent - she was speaking, after all, at an event to celebrate the Bhagavad Gita, and was recalling a recommendation she had made in Parliament a few years ago, when the Russians had banned the Gita and India had protested - but her comment adds to a long list of statements and actions by our new rulers that cumulatively have stirred disquiet across the country.Is this wise? It is ironic that Prime Minister Modi keeps on emphasising the message of development and economic transformation, while his aides persist in raising bogeys that their leader has been attempting to lay to rest. There is little doubt that after the BJP rode to power on a mantra of inclusive development - "sab ka saath, sab ka vikas" - its Hindutva core has begun to take advantage of its proximity to government to assertively push a sectarian agenda.Hindutva acolytes are being appointed to research professorships and vice-chancellorships, the Indian Council of Historical Research is headed by a true believer whose Hindutva credentials outshine his historical ones, textbooks are being rewritten to privilege ancient Hindu glories, and Sanskrit is being promoted. Some of this, one might argue, is inevitable in any democracy after a transfer of power from one ruling dispensation to another. But some, at least, distracts from the Prime Minister's central and oft-repeated message that economic growth is his faith, the Constitution is his holy book and Parliament is his temple.Just as investors tend not to come to war zones - which is why peace on our borders is in our national interest - so too do investors prefer to risk their capital in harmonious societies that are focused on the future rather than divided by the past. The BJP and its government should heed one simple dictum: leave religion to the personal space and preference of every Indian. Let us have no national holy book, just as our Constitution does not permit us to have a national religion. Our country was once divided over religion; let us not now promote a Partition in the Indian soul that will be as bad as the Partition we have already endured in the Indian soil. Let us not awake demons that seven decades of secular Indian democracy have put to rest after the tragic horrors of 1947.It is time to let sleeping dogmas lie.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Now lets hope the ones who comment here think first and write later. Not just write for the sake of writing. Every text book should glorify love of motherland, helping needy &amp; poor, Self Reliance, respect for women &amp; fellow human being, cleanliness, self respect, new ideas, etc. These virtues are mentioned in all holy books. Being a christian, I myself know that it is completely incorrect to follow the book word by word. There are passages about destructions, killings in Bible too. But we have to remember only the good parts. Similarly Sri Krishna asks Yudhisthir to lie to Dronacharya for winning the battle.This was basically to win by hook or crook a battle for dharma. But we cannot teach children this as this can be misinterpreted by them too. In Quran, Prophet talks more of love than war. He talks about war only when there is no choice against oppression and only against the people who do it. But Terrorists kill everyone and hence killing off humanity. Again this can lead to misinterpretation. Similarly, even if I pray to allah in english, he will listen to me. I dont have to act/dress/eat like an Arab to pray to god.<br/>
To conclude, not all holy books are perfect. They are written long way back for a society relevant at that time. There are mostly good virtues in them, which should be followed. Proclaiming any of these books written by these authors as holy books, may not get the desired effect for the civilized society of current generation

                            We have seen and known the Fate of Nations that allow Religion to take center Stage. Take any Islamic State, Pakistan, Saudi, Egypt, Iran or any state which focusses on Religion more than its people. See where there are and see how religious groups tear the fabric of society for personal gain and power and destroy lives, futures and entire nations. See how religion is used by a few to spread far more hatred than hate itself. Learn from what Muslims have done to their religion and their people. I despise and distrust every religious fundamentalist who preaches and talks religion, be it muslim, Hindu or Christian.

                            A pseudo secularist Chamcha of Evangelists, fundamentalist &amp; feku family will say that Gita should by be honoured as national book and even defame Gita the sacred philosophy which only says all Gods are one! Which other religion says all Gods are one? Every other religion says its God is higher than the rest, creating hatred in the world and breeding terrorists! low morals also will not understand Gita and won't allow it to flourish, so if morals are good speed the greatness of Gita which teaches us to love all Gods and humans!

                            With economy improving on its own without much effort of the government, their minds are idle and have become devil's workshop. Well read , well learned and tall intellectual leaders and visionaries like Rajaji, Nehru -Rajaji has even written elevating treatises and commentary on scriptures- would have declared Gita as a national book , but for the fact that they were in perfect senses not to do it considering the syncretic nature of India. Even within the so-called Hinduism , preference to one stream of thought would rile a few sections , who do not subscibe to philosophy of that stream. The BJP government appears to be displaying the existence of government in greatre measure than matters of governance in contrast to their election eve declamations!

                            Is Bhagavad Gita a Holy Book ? Did Sushma Swaraj mentioned it as National Holy Book ? Hiduism has a lot of old literatures that depict just the philosophy of Indianness. Bhagawad Gita is a literature that is widely studied across different sections of people around world.<br/><br/>
POOR INDIANS, sometimes, may be the UN will declare it as a great literature but we, inside the country will fight for the sake of secularism.

                            Thank God that a secular politician has acknowledged the fact that India was once partitioned because of a religion, you don't find any secular person acknowledging it as they believe that it will lead to "Communal tensions", it's the same reason why many people now also oppose Gita, Sanskrit etc as they believe it will lead to "Communal tensions", seems partition is in vain.

You are absolutely correct. An UN official like you should never compromise on this and never praise Modi until his party becomes a forward looking party. Swachcha Bharat can easily become a Aswachcha Bharat if the communal harmony is damaged. BJP should leave the choice of religion and religious books to individuals.

                            All very well to leave religion alone to personal space...but, what must any government (UPA / NDA / whoever) do when foreign forces (read: Christian missionaries &amp; Muslim caliphate state ideologists) are funded &amp; inspired to convert Hindus methodically into their religion? <br/><br/>
Answer: Anti-conversion Law (not even "willing" conversions, for they almost always are induced with the story of better socio-economic status &amp; respect, but, ultimately to secure vote-bank)<br/><br/>
Hindus would be ready to accept such a law, are other minorities too?

                            I tend to agree with Tharoor ji on this. No doubt the Gita is a very enriching holy book, but there is no need to have a "national holy book" as such in a secular country.<br/><br/>
Maybe, what Sushma ji meant was to celebrate the Gita as an important Indian treasure. That's fine I guess, but it can't constitutionally be made the official book in the likes of our national animal, the tiger, for example.<br/><br/>
It is best to acknowledge the Gita as an "unofficial" national holy book.

                            What is the need for a 'national book' which will not be accepted by many in the country? Instead of trying to force religion down the throat of the people, the government will be better of focusing on the economy and the social aspects. Although born 'Hindus', there are many who do not practice the religion, or who do not subscribe to the practices associated with it. Then there is the problem of the caste system. Let the BJP focus on eradicating the evils associated with Hinduism, rather than promoting the controversial aspects.

                            There is no doubt that Mother  India then termed as   Bharatha varsh was the punya bhoomi in the entire world around 5000 years back . Its ideal location between equator and the   latitude of around 30 degrees North, with  mighty snow clad Himalayas on the north and the great Hindu maha sagar on the south and Arabian sea and bay of Bengal on other sides with their warm waters, resulted in bountiful  monsoons and perennial rivers and  thick tropical forests all over the country. This  resulted  in  flourishing of great civilization more than 5000 years back with abundant wealth and thoroughly satisfied population turning their attention to philosophical inquiry of the cosmos and the human soul. As a result the great scriptures like  Vedas, Upanishads , Brahma suthras were produced. Ayurveda, astronomy and mathematics were developed as sciences. <br/>
It was too good to last. Some thing went wrong. The most tasteful fruit started to rot.Probably that is how Nature works. <br/>
Asathoma sadgamaya has reversed and people started to move from Sath to Asath and from brilliant light to thamas or darkness. Gone were the claims of Vasudhaika kutumbam and we divided the countrymen into innumerable castes and sub castes and a new caste of Dalits was created. They were castigated as dalits and segregated. From the position of one and only one universal Para Brahman which is  pervading the entire universe we stooped to create  hundreds of Gods. The worst of all is we have to feed the Mighty one who creates and feeds and nourishes all of us. Hypocrisy and foolishness can not go beyond. We did every thing that  Bhagavadgeetha teaches and best way to bury it is to place it on a high pedestal and forget it forever just as we did to Gandhi.<br/>
When will India rise above these petty minds and walk like a colossal around the Globe? Will it ever?

                            Very objective manifestations of the current secularist or pluralist mindsets as you may like to call. One may not call Mrs Swaraj or anyone else for that matter a non-secular for raising such an issue but definitely being secular 'in my way' is the most troubling part these days. I myself being a hardcore BJP supporter commend you for your laudable penning down of this article Mr. Tharoor.

                            "Rashtriya Granth" is "National Book" - and NOT "National HOLY book" -<br/><br/>
The first line of this article is logically wrong and looks prejudiced. Hence did not bother to read the rest of it. Maybe on the whole it could be right, but I can't believe that Shashi could make a literal translation "error" - so my conlcusion is that he wilfully introduced this misleading translation, to suit his subsequent points.<br/><br/>
Not expected from Shashi Tharoor. Disppointing.

                            What the RSS lead BJP has ever given a true single line from the holy book ? they want Ram Rajya on the country, but never practise on the foot path of RAM, they want Bhagvad Gita to be holy book of this country, but never ever say or preach the world a single line from the holy book. They are simply fooling the poor follower in the name of religion. They are talking about development but never acted on development, they talk about women empowerment but never ever reach to the women to empower them. I think this government is the worst ever elected by the people and will regret for years.

                            Gita is not a holy book.  Gita is a book of incomplete debate. Arjun raised questions regarding necessity of war. Srikrishna had not answered all his questions properly. Instead, he used hypnotic tactics to serve his emergency purpose and provoked Arjun for war, which solved the problem for the time being. However, the debate remained inconclusive. So those who are serious about Gita, they should conduct the debate of Gita again; this debate should continue till achievement of logical conclusion. Till then, use of Gita as a holy book is to be kept at halt.....

                            Shashi beta, first try to control ur marriage life. then start giving advice to the government on what to do and not to do. Congress screwed India by looting poor people and now BJP is creating development to India at a rate that u know that if u dont bring communal violence and LTTE as ur topic, u cannot definitely not win the next election.<br/><br/>
BJP surge is on and it will not decline.Indians are moving towards a United India, not the breaking India what we saw for the last 70 years.

                            I do not know that the meaning of Rashtriya Granth is National Holy Book. Its literal meaning is only National Book. Where from did the word 'holy' come in, except for making it a religious controversial issue (true to the character of the so-called secular stream) for political purposes. The words National Bird / National animal etc. do not have 'holy' attached to it. Please do not bring religious hatred.

                            There are Ministers and MPs who do not seem to understand that they were elected to deliver on governance. They are still trying to please a relatively small group with vote bank politics. To waste time and column space on them is really not worth it. Mr Modi and the BJP should decide their place based on their contribution to governance.

                            I just have 1 question to Mr. Tharoor and all others who oppose this idea of BhagavadGita being the National book. I agree that all religious books like Quran, Bible and co. are equal to Gita. But, it is also true that none of the others were "born" in India. Neither were they part of Ancient India. I accept that they form a crucial role in shaping the Indian culture of the present day. But, they are, I repeat, not "revealed" in India. No one is saying that you should put Gita ahead of Bible if you are a Christian. Tiger is the National animal of India. It doesn't mean everyone should consider lion as inferior to tiger. The same goes with Gita and other books as well.

                            @Anonymous: Shashi Tharoor does not have a choice. He cannot write his thoughts independently. If he wants to retain his place in the Congress party, as well as any position he is given, he has to adopt the party stand. If he praises the BJP or Narendra Modi, it will definitely attract displeasure from many party colleagues, who are from parties dead opposed to the BJP (examples: Kerala Congress, Muslim League and so on). After all, he is not an independent writer, or person now. He is part of the Congress party, and he better fit into the culture, if he is to survive.

                            It was only a question of time before Tharoor took advantage of the furore created by the media relating to Sushma Swaraj's suggestion of making the Gita a National Book and of course, various related 'non' issues.  These issues seem to trouble nobody except publicity seekers such as Yechury, Anand Sharma, Mulayam Singh Yadav and a newly vocal Jyotiradatia Scindia.  Most of the population of India do not consider these issues to have any bearing on their everyday lives and this population includes members of all communities.  Like it or not, Modi is in charge, and unlike congresswalas like Scindia and Tharoor most Indians will not pay abject obeisance to Sonia Gandhi, a relatively uneducated Italian merely because she is white and happens to be a widow of the dreadful parivar that took over India on 15 August 1947.  There is a new Golden Age possible in India where Indians of all communities can take pride in their heritage and not kow-tow to the likes of the parivar.  In the meantime, 'Sub Ka Sath, Sub Ka Vikas'!

                            Just get out of India or ask any foreigner. They will be surprised by the fact that India has 2nd largest musleem population and more then 30 millions christians which is more than the population of majority christian countries. This shows that the whole world identifies India with its hendu identity. India's identity comes with its native hendu religion and native identities like Spirituality, Yoga, Geeta and many more hendu related customs. It is a shame that India's hendu identity is being removed in the name of secularism where as world's largest musleem country Indonasia and other musleem country like Malaysia dont despise their hendu past and still remember and respect it with sanskrit names like Garuda, Indraprasta, Putrajaya etc.

                            Indians somehow live for others but not for India.  They see India as if it started its journey only after Independence, although it has the longest, rich, traditional and cultural history.  Many of Indian leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi drew inspiration from Vedas and bhagavat gita and tried to universalise its teachings through some of their actions.  Many of those actions, including non-violence are being appreciated.  Today many appreciate their actions but failed to recognize the source of those actions.  India has the great spiritual character which can unite every religion in this world and it respects those as well.  But you should learn to learn respect your home and the source.  "Hindu of view of life"by Dr Radhakrishnan provides outstanding insights as to why India is great.

                            Creating a national Religion would be disastrous and throw the whole development back in the 18 century and a lovely nuclear holocaust.

                            I am not sure if making Gita will solve all our problems, but it will definitely create some fresh ones. The Gita's glory is not dependent on its recognition by people how were not even born when this was written. That the Gita provides life's lessons and guidance for us which is relevant even today is testimony of its greatness. It is obvious that it is an attempt by bankrupt politicians to gain relevance in the current dispensation, but do they realise the damage they are causing?
