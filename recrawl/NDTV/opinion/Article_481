Headline::::Dear Prashant Bhai, This is How You Let AAP Down



DateTime::::2015-03-30T14:09:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	Respected Prashant Bhai
	Some relationships are all about shock and awe. I have never been in awe of anyone in my entire career, be it Nelson Mandela or Vivian Richards, but yes, I was always shocked by your audacity to challenge the establishment in courts and I was awed with the hope and aspirations of millions who voted for AAP in 2013, and of whom you are an integral part.   
	But during the 2015 assembly elections, I was looking for that man with determination that I knew you to be, but unfortunately I could not discover that man in the vicinity of my horizon. I was shocked by the turn of the events, and was in awe of the travesty of destiny.
	When I look back, I remember with fondness my meetings as Managing Editor of a news channel with you,  when I would seek your expert legal advice on a few stories which we wanted to carry. You were always more than willing to help.
	During the Anna Hazare anti-corruption movement, you were always open to sharing any information which was news-worthy. I broke many stories. Those were not leaks but genuine information which deserved to be shared with millions. When I joined the party, you were one of the few who genuinely welcomed and encouraged me. It was new territory,  but I knew I was in safe company.
	The initial few months were great. We all were comrades in arms, but during the parliamentary elections, I could sense a tension which grew after the humiliating debacle and turned into an open fissure. I can't exactly pinpoint the date, but it was probably in Tilak Lane, Arvind's residence, when I was jolted out of a slumber in the PAC (Political Affairs Committee) meeting, hearing you shout - "Let us wind up the party". I could not figure out what was the provocation. Later, it became almost a rule. Every now and then you would shout - "Let's wind up the party".
	After hearing this at least four or five times, you will remember that in one of the meetings,  I lost my cool and shouted back and said, "This party is not anyone's property that we should wind up the party. This party belongs to thousands of volunteers and when the whole world is looking at us with hope, what kind of future can we present when we can't talk in a sober and smooth manner?"
	I immediately realised that my outburst would not be liked by you and some others. I was probably provoked by the previous meeting's outburst by your father, Mr. Shanti Bhushan. I remember a few of us were very upset with the frequent outbursts that came from you and your father. In one of these meetings, Shanti ji had openly said, "The National Convener is there only to convene the meetings. He has no power." Everyone present was shocked. A copy of the constitution was brought in, and a heated discussion ensued about the power of the National Convener, Arvind Kejriwal. All of us were sad. This reached a pinnacle when Arvind ended up crying in the National Executive (NE) meet held in Jangpura at your place. Arvind had decided to leave politics and everyone at the NE heard him say that he had fought with governments and top leaders,  but he could not fight with you and Yogendra and let Yogendra ji be made National Convener.
	A truce was reached between you and Arvind. But it was short-lived. Shanti Ji wrote a nasty letter. He told Arvind "You are good for nothing and you better resign and let Yogendra be appointed as National Convener, otherwise he will hold a press conference and expose you." Arvind was very hurt. He had always considered him a father figure and this was most unexpected. Shanti ji had breached the Lakshman Rekha. This is when you should have stepped in and reined in your father. It did not happen. I was also told that you were very angry that Arvind and a few of us for trying to explore the possibility of forming the government with the support of the Congress. I can very well understand if you were upset but to brand us "immoral and opportunist" was not democratic. Everyone has been ordained by the party constitution to express his or her opinion. It was up to the party to accept or reject it. To call names due to this is most undemocratic. It was typical of a Leninist-Stalinist approach. I could say that whenever the PAC did not agree with your opinion, then you lost your cool. May I ask, is it not democratic to accept a majority opinion?
	This tension continued. But it got ugly during the assembly elections. You just rubbished us as a group of hoodlums who are out to grab power. You know very well that I had left a very lucrative job and had been a respected editor. Nobody could ever point a finger at me during my entire career. And here you, who knew me so well, were calling me names. Your father said that I had sold party tickets for some crores. Prashant Bhai, I request you and your father to please ask your friend Arun Jaitley and get an inquiry done, and if I am found guilty,  then put me in jail, otherwise you both tender a public apology.
	Prashant Bhai, can you explain when thousands of volunteers were slogging day and night, were fighting a life and death battle for party, how many days did you campaign for the party? Let me remind you if you have forgotten -  just one day in Timarpur for your friend Pankaj Pushkar.
	Can you inform the whole world how many times you threatened to hold a press conference and destroy the party? Why don't you confide to the public at large why senior members of the party from outside Delhi had to be deputed to talk to you, to convince you to not go public? These people spent days and hours at your residence and in your chamber. All of us who were working day and night lived in dread as we were living in eternal uncertainty wondering when, you will hold a press conference and destroy the party. We knew it would be a great scoop for the media and the BJP.
	The reason was that  you were upset with the candidate selection. You had a problem with a few. Let everyone know that all these names were sent to the Complaints Committee, and when you were not satisfied with their decision, then it was taken to the Lokpal,  and when the Lokpal decided to drop two names on the last day of nominations, it was immediately complied with. You had no reason to be angry. Every process inscribed in the party constitution was duly followed. Every scrutiny was done, and may I ask you, which party drops its candidate on the last day of nomination? We could not have done more. Sorry, sir, you were wrong.
	I am not blaming you but the reality was that the entire list of candidates whom you thought were inppropriate was leaked to an English newspaper and this traumatized us no end. Shanti ji gave an interview to a business daily and praised Kiran Bedi, and the next day, his praise turned into hate and he described Arvind as worse than  Ajay Maken of the Congress. It is true that you contradicted your father. But the damage was done. Ideally,  you being the chairman of the national disciplinary committee, should have given instructions to issue a notice for him to be disciplined. It was an anti-party activity. But that did not happen. Please tell me, why I should not conclude that he had your silent consent, as you yourself had openly declared that AAP should lose the elections and should not win more than 22 seats?  And it was you who had discouraged outside volunteers not to come to Delhi for campaigning.
	Prashant Bhai. I was really shocked by your behavior. And open defiance. No organisation will survive if a minimum discipline is not adhered to. Tell me, if you had been the National Convener, and a senior member would have replicated your behaviour, how would you have reacted? I am always in awe of life, and always remember it takes millions of seconds to create something, but only a few seconds to destroy. It. Even if things did not move the way you wanted, was it not possible to sit together after the elections and force everyone to see the light, instead of damaging the party when it was in the battlefield? Prashant Bhai, someday you will realise you were wrong, and then you will regret it, but maybe by then it will be too late.

                            Dear Ashutosh: This is how you let India down.<br/><br/>
For a moment, think beyond AAP and about what is good for India. It is important for India to have a corruption free party with strong morals, very strong internal democracy and a very strong system of checks and balances. This helps drive reform in other parties as well.<br/>
Even the best of intentions need debate else as we all know - the road to hell is paved with good intentions. <br/><br/>
You seem to believe that AAP winning elections is best for India. Unfortunately most of us believe that AAP winning elections in the RIGHT way is best for India. Ceaser's wife should be above suspicion. <br/>
Why is it that undeserving people were given tickets and then PB had to fight to keep AAPs moral compass straight? If it were not for PB, they probably would have gone ahead and maybe even won the elections. If you were willing to tolerate that, I have to doubt YOU, Arvind, Ashish and not PB or YY. Former PM Manmohan probably never took a bribe but his sin was to tolerate it.<br/><br/>
And THAT is the root of my disenchantment with AAP. If there were not one but multiple undeserving people who got tickets, it is a very strong indication that AAP is willing to cut corners to get power and that Mr. Ashutosh, is an extremely slippery slope.<br/><br/>
I was elated when AAP won seats the first time round. When AAP chose to take support of Congress, I grieved as if my family member died. I knew that day that AAP was willing to compromise for power instead of fighting on principle. There is no salvation on that path.<br/><br/>
Just because you take a few voter friendly decisions does not make you a party with a difference. For all the corruption of UPA and NDA, they too took some decisions which benefited voters.<br/><br/>
Given the current polarisation, I doubt that anyone in AAP will understand the point I am making. It is always easy to find justifications to do whatever you want to. USA justified the invasion of Iraq, Iraq justified invasion of Kuwait... The Holocaust was justified too.<br/><br/>
It was a cheap shot for you to mention that you quit a lucrative job to join AAP. If you cannot participate in AAP with integrity, you might as well go back. You cannot even begin to comprehend what you, AAP and ultimately India lost over the last few months. <br/><br/>
I was considering donating 25% of my life savings to AAP and I know of many of my friends who we considering substantial donations of money and time. Just like Subhash Chandra Bose did, AAP could have asked for blood and AAP would have  got it. You were supported because you promised to changed Indian politics and not just a few policies. <br/><br/>
What happened was a tragedy and you were one of the perpetrators.<br/><br/>
A heart-broken Indian.

                            Mr. Ashutosh --- whats has been "your" contribution to AAP or India against corruption till date? <br/><br/>
Bhushan fought tough cases agains Coal scam; in fact single handedly led the court to quash coal allocations that brought in 2,000,000 crores (count the zeros once) for the nation. Even you accept he was the brains behind exposing corrupt Congress politicians. <br/><br/>
Which brings me to my question -- what have you done for AAP till now? You accuse Yogendra Yadav and Bhushans. May be they were angry that AAP gave tickets to corrupt people. Even "your own" Lokpal found 2 of 10 candidates corrupt. Yo also accuse Yadav, but give no proof.<br/><br/>
I can only assume that you are licking Arvind's boots and will do everything to make a unipolar party where you get your own cut.

                            The sting shows Arvind is genuinely mad at Prashanth. And may be it is true he wanted the party to loose to learn a lesson. But why would he do that? What lead to a scream that woke you from the slumber during the PAC meeting? The meat is in the reasons. Perhaps he felt that you guys are making compromise to the founding principles. Like Arvind said several times, AAP is not important. AK is not important. This country is important. But now that you are in politics, AAP is important and it coming to power is very important. Values dont count. Now after the win, you are degenrating into a communist regime, where people will be purged because AK does not like them. Who is in a neutral position to evaluate if AK's assumptions are indeed true? Well now PB and YY are gone, you and other chamchas may fill those positions. Good luck. After all when Anna said politics is a gutter and it corrupts, we all disagreed and supported AAP. After all he has been proved right. Does not matter who is right AK or PB/YY. You have let us down. <br/><br/>
BTW If power is Delhi is what defines you, Many of us who did not have any stake in delhi supported you for the idea of AAP. Other wise who cares who is the CM of this small city. There are many who do a decent job.

                            This constant stream of public letters from AAP members and its expelled members are now getting boring. AAP is reduced to a single state Delhi-centric party. No need for the media to give it so much space.

                            It is more than two months since they came to power and all that we see is egoistic billiards and nothing else.  If they are not capable, President's Rule must be imposed.

As you're writing this letter, the lokpal has been reconstituted with loyalists, the disciplinary committee has been reconstituted with yes men. Not sure you may write another open letter with charges on Admiral Ramdas.. But the writing on the wall is clear, it has become Arvind Admi party..

You are worst person to tell Prashant and Yogendra about how they should have behaved. I think Arvind and you and thousands of people in AAP think that since Delhi is won we are done but dont forget that you are going the Congress and BJP way make use of people and then throw them out. Arvind sir I was supporting you all this while now I think you are just one of those power hungry politician with sycophants like Ashutosh around you. Ashutosh when you get time just think, what has been your contribution to AAP and then weigh it with what Yogendra and Prashanth have done to bring AAP to this studio. There is a established credibility that you are loosing and you guys are not bothered I can only be surprised. Sorry I do not support anymore.

Comment::::<div class="com_user_text">
                            Dear Mr Managing Editor the blog traces your transformation from <br/>
"During the Anna Hazare anti-corruption movement, you were always open to sharing any information which was news-worthy. I broke many stories. Those were not leaks but genuine information which deserved to be shared with millions."<br/>
to<br/>
"I am not blaming you but the reality was that the entire list of candidates whom you thought were inppropriate was leaked to an English newspaper and this traumatized us no end."<br/>
The way I see it is <br/>
when you are a receiver it's NOT a leak and when you are the story then its a leak? Is that what you are saying? Are you not using the term 'leak' to your conveninece here? Would you care to explain that Mr Ashutosh?<br/><br/><br/>
You said,<br/>
"Shanti ji had openly said, "The National Convener is there only to convene the meetings. He has no power." Everyone present was shocked. A copy of the constitution was brought in, and a heated discussion ensued about the power of the National Convener, Arvind Kejriwal."<br/>
And the above (incident) made you sad. Why? Do you think anybody (Mr Kejriwal) to be too sacrosanct to be questioned about, either of his power, position or authorities, within the discussion forum of a party? And, you kept back to yourself what provocated Mr Bhushan's(Sr.) to make such a comment. Was Mr Arvind Kejriwal tried to exert too much of power or was it that Mr Bhushan just shouted out of the blue? <br/>
While you clearly called out why you lost your cool and shouted back, you fail to state the reason (intentional, is it?) for Shanti Bhushan's outburst. Sorry, Sir, I think you are paiting a fabricated view here to your conveninece and your inclination is not much in the hiding.<br/><br/>
And, you continued<br/>
"This is when you should have stepped in and reined in your father."<br/>
And, you think it is quite logical for a person to be responsible for his father's action; to intervene and 'rein' his father in, just like what Aurangzeb did to Shah Jahan, when his father put forward his own opinion.<br/><br/><br/>
"You know very well that I had left a very lucrative job and had been a respected editor."<br/>
You know Mr Ashutosh you should have restrain from putting yourself such bare open - your regret resonate in the above statement. If I understood the genesis of AAP correctly then it was perhaps not built for people like you who keeps repeating the above statement at the slightest opportunity. I have not heard Mr Bhushan or Mr Yadav say anything similar... ever. Perhaps you expect a fitting return against your leaving of the lucrative job and at the slightest 'fear' of not realising that return, the above thought keep gazing at you much to your regret, is it? Give it a thought Mr Ashutosh.<br/><br/><br/>
You posed a question "how many days did you campaign for the party? "<br/>
May be because you left a 'lucrative career' to join AAP you fail to realize that there is no scope for (political) compromise in the 'alternative  politics' which is built on honesty and integrity and not to compensate a lucrative career. Hence, if one doesnt feel for a cause it is just worth compromising.<br/><br/>
So far so good, but what blow off the lid was....<br/>
"All of us who were working day and night lived in dread as we were living in eternal uncertainty wondering when, you will hold a press conference and destroy the party."<br/>
Where from the dread and fear originated Mr Ashutosh? Generally, people who have a lot to lose or who fail to be on the right side of things fear either or both of consequence and truth. Which one could be said was applicable to 'All' that you mentioned here? Was it the fear of losing the opportunity to come into 'POWER' - The Consequence? Or was it that you had something to hide which you 'All' dread to get bare - The Truth?<br/><br/>
And, then came the judgement<br/>
"We could not have done more. Sorry, sir, you were wrong."<br/>
So its a judgment, is it? --- YOU WERE WRONG.<br/>
If you would allow me, Sir, who passed this judgement? Have you cared to even glance at the party discussion board? Have you seen how Arvind is being criticised for his megalomanicaism? How the people are loathing this budding 'Yes Men' around him? How they are criticizing only Arvind's smiling face on the AAP communiques of all form? How irritated they are at being fed with one sided stories? How cynical they are sounding? I think you haven't and I think its time to introspect Mr Ashutosh.<br/><br/><br/>
Finally, came the best of 'em all.<br/>
"Even if things did not move the way you wanted, was it not possible to sit together after the elections and force everyone to see the light, instead of damaging the party when it was in the battlefield?"<br/>
Hullo, Sir. Let alone his claims of making personal attempts to reach out to "The Arvind Ji", I myslef have heard Mr Bhushan publicly requesting for a time to meet and talk to iron out any differences, that Mr Arvind did not care to oblidge with. I think he is too powerful to stoop down and talk to any other leader now. After all its 5 saal Kejriwal why would anybody else be given so space to speak. You have the mandate and You have successfully graduated to real politics leaving the 'alternative' one for us to carry forward. Your desertion will make the process slow, may be, but you cannot kill the hope and the dream for cleaner politics. <br/><br/>
I can't help my FAILURE TO TRUST YOU, you seem to be just another opportunist 'YES MAN' of Indian politics who is here for better prospects than the 'lucrative  job' that he has left behind. No wonder your blog start with "I have never been in awe of anyone in my entire career, be it Nelson Mandela or Vivian Richards....."<br/>
I am not surprised that you had never been in awe of anyone, Mr Ashutosh,  you are far too conceited person to do that.

Thought that AK would be a game changer in Indian Politics and thus more and more youth attracted towards politics. Alas, AK within a short period provided he is worse than MK, Mulayam, Mayawati Lalu etc., If you do not believe, go and seek fresh mandate from the people of Delhi and you would know the popularity of AK

                            Prasanth is correct in that AAP promised a different kind of politics. NOT 1-man supremo culture. Such culture inevitably leads to Megalomania ( Modi is an exception ) and we can clearly see Arvind showing symptoms of it.

We know you are an opportunist but please don't show it on face.<br/>
Where were you when Mr. Kejriwal along with his fellow comrades was fighting the war on corruption?<br/><br/>
You only joined them when they were doing well and got recognition of the People.<br/>
Stop treating yourself as a gentleman as we all know what you media folks are in Real.<br/><br/>
Shut mouth and do some good work for the people who still believe in AAP.<br/><br/>
We are not here to see theatrics , we had enough of the same in last 60 years we want genuine Action.<br/><br/>
Hope AAP listens to the real Aam Aadmi and fulfills its promise else it would be a revolution in futility.

I can rebut each point in your slander email but I only have time for one.<br/><br/>
SO Prashant Bhushan was expected to take disciplinary action  on his father, a Man who is one of the topmost lawyer in the country, who voiced his opinion on Kejriwal.I ask you if you think that SHanti Bhushan has done something wrong , why did you not file an application to disciplinary committee.AT that time , Mr Kejriwal was doing drama , saying things like .. SHanti Bhushan is like my father .He can say anything to me .Even slap me.Why did Mr. Kejriwal say at that time that this is not right and it should be punished.If what Mr Shanti Bhushan has said was wrong you should have taken action right there .If his words sound wrong now , there were wrong then also.<br/>
I will never  believe Kejriwal words any more.I also have learnt another lesson .If a thing is wrong in present,it should be corrected in present and not waut for future.I feel ashamed that even though i could see inconsistencies of Mr. Kejriwal , I still kept quiet and encouraged friends and family to vote for a delusional person.

You dream of becoming an MP will now realize soon. Now that you and your biddies pushed out founding members PB and YY, you will be the beneficiary of becoming Rajya Sabha MP with the help from newly elected Delhi MLA's. You are right they are selfish and they formed the party with Arvind but you are a saint. You joined the party for no posts but you contested the general elections. With your saintly skills you eliminated competition for that MP seat. Soon you will be that MP.

                            Taking whatever you are saying on face value without even listening to other side's version,Two things Ashutosh: 1. You can accuse PB of un-parliamentary behavior, treating party as his personal property but he could have "chastened" after Delhi election instead of AK taking the position "either them or me". PB's ways were wrong but not his thoughts. If AK had taken position to throw Shanti &amp; Shalini out that was all right but not PB. 2. What about YY? Your best spokesperson till date (learn something from him, coz u are worst). How do u shove down my throat the charge that he was working against party when i voted for u beacuse of him! Even if he was angling for NC's post (a charge with no proof directly against YY till date accept Bhushan's endorsement for his name) what is wrong with it? Has the AK been given NC's post for a life time? U cannot kick someone out because of his political ambitions only! In the nut shell, this problem was solvable but the ego and tyranny of AK and men made of Tin &amp; Straw like u it blew out of proportions. And by the way how do I take ur word as gospel truth against the words of likes of Anand Kumar, Ramdas, mayank, Prbhat Jha etc? r they all liars? Why AK is referred to as tyrant by every single person who has left AAP? Was it the behaviors of PB and Shanti that triggered this problem or was it huge ego of AK which could not take dissenting voice? This whole drama has caused irreparable damage to brand AAP. so, sir how different you guys are in terms of Anti-Party activities. By the way I have been a staunch and active supporter of party.

Well, how would you know about the founding issues as you were not there and joined later as an OPPORTUNIST MONKEY.

                            This is the level they have come down to. Really, I mean this is a totally different party. Instead of fighting the opposition, they have created a opposition party within themselves and fighting each other. They however realised that the 70 promises to the people of delhi are a damp squib and cannot be fulfilled without the help from the central Govt. so divert the mind towards this fiasco and when not in control, run away giving some lame excuse and call for fresh elections.

                            Hello Ashutosh,   Bulk of the comments on your blog as well as the ones you wrote during the last month or so when issues in AAP came public are all critical of you and the AK coterie. Hope you realize this and understand the overwhelming mood of the volunteers. You have written a lot about PB/YY/SB tempers and they shouting and calling you and AK camp names etc. The language used by AK in the leaked tape with Umesh Singh does not hold AK in good light either. So lets ignore these kind of issues of shouting, calling names etc which happen when tempers flare up. Lets get down to core issues.<br/>
1) Is there inner party democracy in AAP? You may give few examples and say procedures were followed, but they all give the impression that things were done for names sake<br/>
2) Who gave AAP the 2 crore rupees donations? Why is AAP not investigating it? Even if you now say it has been agreed to be investigated, why there has been so much pressure to get it done. With the standards AAP was expected to function, this investigation should have been launched as soon as the news came out.<br/>
3) Similar point about the person who was caught with loads of alcohol. Some of the defense I heard in TV was that police is investigating. Well, that is the defense that normal traditional parties give. Has AAP stooped to that level?<br/>
I cant remember all, but the issues that YY/PB raised are quite valid and action should have been taken automatically without all these problems. The fact that it was not done shows, AK camp has things to hide. The very nature in which the NC meeting was done was stage managed.<br/>
1) Why was no secret ballot<br/>
2) Why was independent observers (like Lokpal) not allowed<br/>
3) Why was proceeding not web cast?<br/>
4) AK tapes from NE released are just selective.<br/>
These further strengthen the belief of ordinary supporters like me, that AK camp did not do things in a manner expected from AAP and are hiding things and have stooped to level of other traditional parties. India does not need another traditional party - we have enough of them. What we need is a party that AAP set out to be - a party that upholds very high standards of alternative politics. Its not late. Diverse opinions that go to nasty levels can be expected in any organization. What is needed is to realize mistakes on either side, reconcile and work together. Otherwise you shatter the dreams of millions of volunteers.

                            "You know very well that I had left a very lucrative job and had been a respected editor. Nobody could ever point a finger at me during my entire career."  <br/>
So, back to self certification, are we? I'm amazed at the gall of AAP and its Hall of Shame. Each one is a master at running down others without a shred of proof but equally quick to give themselves a clean chit for their own outrageous misdemeanors. Respected editor, my foot!<br/><br/>
"I was also told that you were very angry that Arvind and a few of us for trying to explore the possibility of forming the government with the support of the Congress."<br/><br/>
So, the cat is out of the bag! AAP's shadowy figures were lobbying to deal with Congress while promising their voters &amp; volunteers that all these rumours were lies &amp; floated by the opposition.<br/><br/>
"Can you inform the whole world how many times you threatened to hold a press conference and destroy the party? Why don't you confide to the public at large why senior members of the party from outside Delhi had to be deputed to talk to you, to convince you to not go public? These people spent days and hours at your residence and in your chamber. All of us who were working day and night lived in dread as we were living in eternal uncertainty wondering when, you will hold a press conference and destroy the party"<br/><br/>
If Prashant Bhushan has the power to "destroy the party" with a single presser &amp; if Ashutosh n Co were "living in dread" of such a presser, it is a clear acknowledgement that the skeletons in the AAP cupboard are large, numerous and obnoxious. The faster the Charlatan-in-Chief AK and his 40 or more thieves are sent packing, the better it would be for us. Otherwise, no one will ever trust a "kraantikaari" anymore.

However, I cannot say the same thing on your leader AK. He is egoistic, gets emotional when somebody expresses an opinion he doesn't like, impatient.

ironically some times ago few people criticise prashant bhushan on his views over kashmir disputes and Yogendra for his  salim controversy and views in favour  naxalites but now they are hero for those who wants to sabotage AAP.

                            Ashutosh is blaming Prashant for actions of Sh. Shanti Bhushan as if Prashant is guardian. Ashutosh probably has not seen different political linking within families. further, it is expected that every one should behave the way one individual would like. This would only be possible if party consists of people of low intelligence. I still wonder if present crisis is successful operation of some competitor to draw a wedge between persons who matter. This would ensure that party disintegrates by next election and such people will go for ghar Wapsi!

This is not same AAP which has sacrificed 49 day Govt. for so called lokpal people of Delhi are in state of shock after knowing the thought process of Kejriwalji the result of fall our is evident some of AAP prominent members have opted for immediate resignation viz. Mrs Damania, Mrs Patkar and it can be simply said that the some were kicked out though it is not a slang for AAP. <br/>
Instead of writing letters and justifying what has been done it is time to undo entire episode say sorry sorry and start afresh people of Delhi  will accept it no issues whatsoever forget and forgive.

                            Please keep such post break up conversations limited to party's personal portal. Publishing such an op-ed on a national channel is nothing but juvenile. Washing dirty linen in public is something your party excels at, be it Mr. Bhushan or Mr. Kejriwal. What Mr. Kejriwal did to others is exactly what Mr. Bhushan did to your party.He kept threatening to break out into a press conference at the blink of an eye. Mr. Bhushan as it seems is a quick learner and pulled off a Kejriwal on AAP itself.We suggest that it will do a world of good if you break this trend or rather stay away from it. Introspect and regroup without trying to sound like a nineteen year old lovelorn girl. Not recommended. <br/>
Best wishes.

The people were no option, so voted you, don't think you are now Super man..App means gentlemen Party, not like the word (Galis)  used by your leader and eliminating good people from Party..The people not think AAP means Sanjay Singh, Mr Shishodia, Gopal and the great poet !

                            "Its simple Ashutosh...we the outsiders can see it clearly. You are right in thinking politically and having joined a party on a rise to desire more and more of its rise at any cost. After all you also get d rise. Nothing personal brotger but what about the hope and faith of the people that AAP will be a party of difference. If AAP was to in d end be no different then any other political party...then what right you had to talks about political morality, transparecy and ethics. You talk about betrayal, it is us who have been betrayed the most. You yourself need to personally introspect and find out what is it that you truely want. And come out in your true colurs this time.i

                            That Kejriwal was wronged by the Bhushans is widely acknowledged. The contours of the motive could well be traced to the personal ambitions of the senior Bhushan, for himself and his family. But does the shabby treatment given to Prof. Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha and the somersault on the internal Lokpal Admiral (Retd) Ramdas have any justifications? The conduct of the National Council meeting on 28/03/2015 is full of illegalities, irregularities and absurdities. Do two wrongs may a right?

                            One sided story coming out in public first about YY and then about PB. This is plain dirty. I don't care about YY and PB either, but the whole AAP dispensation at present is just lion in sheep's clothing. Saying things with a straight and pained face is either pure duplicity or they just believe in their own holier than thou attitudes and block out reality. Just a bunch of liars. No ideology, just compromized anti corruption crusaders.

Sanjay,Ashish, ashutosh and kumar Vishwas are sure to Get Rajya Sabha Seat so they will keep quite too.......<br/><br/>
Kejriwal is like Mahishasur' PENANCE to Lord Shiva, and when got boon he tried killing Lord shiva....he portrayed working for Greedy People of Delhi and these people gave him vote...now this kejriwal turned to screw Delhites.....<br/><br/>
Neither Yogendra, bhushan kejriwal is fit for administration services...they can announce free or compensatory offers, but don't know how to administered and generate revenue

                            I know you will deny this. Ashuthosh, for your kind information, just as you and your party including your boss arvind were spreading lies about BJP approaching your MLAs inducing them with crores of rupees in return for their support to form the govt at Delhi, it is now clearly exposed by your own MLA and eminent party worker that those calls were faked by arvind kejriwal asking someone from your party to impersonate Gadkari and Arun Jaitley. Those calls were recorded and shown as proof to the innocent public. But when the Delhi police traced the calls, picked up the callers (AAP workers), they spilled the beans stating that they did these fake calls on the instructions of arvind kejriwal. These AAP workers broke down in the police station (that is what your party colleague confesses) and came out with the truth without the help of a lie detector. what do you have to say about this? I am not a BJP supporter, but I am aghast at the level that you, your party workers, your leaders, and arvind kejriwal can stoop to defame others. What if the BJP filed a defamation case against you? All of you will be behind bars, but who will govern delhi? I only hope this happens soon because the delhi police is an efficient force and will eventually dig up all the hidden agenda of AAP. It is shameful that you all had to stoop to this level. Refer to Mr.Garg's statements on television channels about the issue and you will have no place to hide, not even in the confines of your bedroom. So it is always better you carry mirrors instead of bouncers and body builders with you. And a very important thing, please make it a point in your next NC meeting to bring about a resolution for all AAP leaders and workers to "hold their tongue"....it is simply dirty  to listen to you all speak and what you all speak makes no sense at all. learn to behave in public. This is not your family backyard...
