Headline::::Lok Sabha Passed This Bill, But It's Deeply Flawed



DateTime::::2015-12-18T10:42:00+05:30




                                On Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed the government's Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill. Had the Congress Party not been boycotting parliament, I would have spoken on the subject. I would have taken longer than the length of a column to do it, but my main concerns haven't been addressed, and they are worth airing before the Bill goes to the Rajya Sabha.
First, all citizens of India should be alarmed at the large number of Ordinances which have been brought in under the garb of "governance'' by this government. The power to promulgate ordinances, under Article 123 of the Constitution, is a special intervention by the Executive as a matter of last resort to fill a policy vacuum. By promulgating more than ten Ordinances in the last few months, including the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 (on 23 October), the government has overlooked the route of mediating to achieve conciliation among parties, but has instead bred a culture of 'governance through ordinance'.
Having said that, however, there is no doubt that an efficient Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) system is crucial for a country like India. We cannot expect our business ventures to succeed if they are stuck in long and tedious judicial proceedings to resolve their disputes. It is an undisputed fact that litigation is a time-consuming exercise in India. As of 2014, the number of pending cases in the courts of India were as high as 65,970 cases in the Supreme Court, 44,79,023 cases in the High Courts and 2,73,60,814 cases in the District Courts of the country - a total backlog of more than three crore cases in courts across the country.
Our economic growth and burgeoning population have not seen an equal increase in the number of courts and judicial officers. I have myself urged the government on many occasions to establish a Bench of the High Court of Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, to supplement the High Court at Ernakulum for the expeditious disposal of cases. I have a pending Private Member's Bill in this House for this cause. But no action has been initiated by the Government to set up such a Bench or generally to increase the number of courts and judges in our country. Delays continue, cases pend, while justice weaves its stately, process-laden course into the dreary desert sands of dead habit.
No wonder foreign investors have shown great reluctance to set up offices in India, citing our tedious legal system. Arbitration is an excellent mechanism for speedy resolution of conflicts, but to our shame, international businesses operating in India prefer to arbitrate abroad in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. Even Mauritius is offering itself as a place to settle disputes affecting businesses in India! Â 
To take Singapore as one example, apart from a strong legal framework, it offers hefty tax breaks to law firms on income from arbitration cases and has eased restrictions to enable foreign law firms to practice in Singapore. Singapore is therefore attracting arbitration business from our country (India is the country with the most number of cases at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre). This is a standing reproach to our failure to deliver an effective arbitration mechanism in India. We cannot urge businesses to "make in India" without encouraging them to Arbitrate in India.
Mahatma Gandhi mentions in his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, how it struck him one day 'that the true function of a lawyer was to unite parties riven asunder'. This is perhaps the best argument for arbitration, which has been an alternative system of justice since ancient times. One doesn't have to recall examples of arbitration in Roman law, when even in ancient India, disputes were often resolved by a single headman or a village panchayat.
The economic reforms of 1991 ushered in an era of globalisation and created a need for an alternative forum to resolve disputes involving international commercial transactions. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was introduced by the then Congress government to consolidate the law on domestic arbitration and provide for international commercial arbitration on the basis of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law model. But India has resisted adopting this practice widely, and though the Act has been in force for nearly two decades now, the practice has not kept up with the law.
The BJP government's 2015 Ordinance did not do enough to minimize the supervisory role of courts in arbitration proceedings. Under clause 15 of the Ordinance, for instance, arbitration proceedings have to conclude within a period of 18 months, or else the mandate of the arbitrator will be terminated unless the Court extends the time period. But arbitration proceedings in our country take a minimum of two years to conclude and vary depending on the nature, complexity, and stakes involved in different disputes. For arbitration proceedings that exceed this time period, the parties will have to apply to the Court for an extension of the mandate of arbitral tribunals. This has created an unnecessary interference of the Court and will defeat the very objective of arbitration by delaying the arbitration process.
While the Government wants to allow High Courts in India to pass interim orders for international commercial arbitrations seated outside India, it has failed to specify the criteria for determining the jurisdiction of the High Court. Ideally the jurisdiction of a Civil Court or a High Court is determined on the basis of the place or territory of the subject. But when you are talking about International Commercial Arbitrations seated abroad, involving transactions conducted abroad, how do you decide which High Court will have jurisdiction? If we do not address this loophole, parties in dispute will have to wait for the courts to decide the criteria - which will bring in more delays in arbitration.
Additionally, the new law should have had a provision for recognizing emergency arbitrators and their decisions. Decisions of emergency arbitrators are now recognized in arbitration rules of most international arbitral institutions to assist parties who want urgent relief. Countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore have recently amended their arbitration laws to enforce the decisions of emergency arbitrators. Our new law doesn't do this.
The Arbitration practice in our country should encourage academicians or lawyers as arbitrators instead of only retired judges of the Supreme and High Courts. This is the practice in countries with successful arbitration mechanisms, such as the US. While a judge would bring judicial experience to a proceeding, arbitration doesn't have to resemble a judicial hearing. There is a need to create a pool of experienced professionals in Arbitration who can be formally trained and certified as arbitrators by a specialized body. In that regard, the law also overlooks the need for a specialized body such as an Arbitral Commission of India to encourage and create awareness of the practice of Arbitration as an alternate method of dispute resolution.
The objective of the law is supposed to be to put in place an updated and modern practice of Alternate Dispute Resolution. Yet there are no provisions that encourage the use of technology during arbitration proceedings. Use of teleconferencing and video-conferencing to replace formal sittings of the arbitral proceedings would save time and aid in a smoother and more efficient conduct of arbitration proceedings.
While I welcome the government attempting to promote arbitration through an amended law, I feel that it could have done more to modernize arbitration in our country, especially when India is favourably placed to take advantage of the shift in global trade and investment from the West. Instead of taking the challenge from Singapore and Hong Kong head on, the government has missed a golden opportunity to address and resolve issues plaguing our dispute resolution system.
We need to reform our arbitration regime to bring it into the 21st century. Sadly, the government's new law doesn't come close enough. Instead of creating the legal equivalent of a bullet-train, the Modi Government has simply missed the bus.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why government has to pass ordinances? Because the Congress party is not interested to work and discuss the bills to pass them in the interest of the nation. If your party would not wash out entire session after session; then you can work with government to discuss, debate and amend the bills before passing. Therefore your stats on high number of ordinance is actually your fault!

And there you have the root cause. How's exactly is "boycotting parliament" going to add to the richness of deliberations of a democracy? If people with a valid point can't speak, if people can't have their genuine questions answered,then clearly, Parliamentary Democracy isn't going to work.

                            These amendments were long overdue. These only reflect the march of law in various decisions of Supreme Court and are substantially the Law Commission's recommendations. More importantly, the power of Indian Courts to pass interim orders in International Commercial Arbitration has only been restored (Bhatia Intl case). When one does not allow parliament to function and boycotts parliament, would he be justified in faulting the Ordinance? The amendments and the Ordinance have reinstated the faith of the stakeholders in arbitration as an effective dispute resolution mechanism.

Having said that it's better to walk two steps rather than promise 10 and not walk at all. Let's get a flawed legislation at this time and improve it as we go along. We have lived without one for so long. Let's at least start reaping the benefits of an improvement even if it doesn't go all the way!

                            Also, the pending cases are not due to erecting more courts but due lack of empowerment the laws create due to its cumbersome nature. Make it simple to give judgement in a day itself. Eg: For murder, why on earth we want separate the motive of muder, planned operations, attacked nature etc... etc.. Make it simple - by real or by mistake. That's it. And award verdict on the day itself. SEVERELY. Otherwise n number of courts or judges won't make anything better but will another curse in our already reeling system.

                            Dear Mr.Tharoor, I agree with your views and could also notice the frustration you have while publishing in a news article of NDTV instead of talking in parliament. Your views are very valid, but the same would have been considered while debating the parliament, rather than just complaining to the public thru news channels. You being an educated MP, should teach discipline, decency and Tolerance to your party who is just disruption the parliament due to personal reasons of your party leaders. I as a citizen is also having equal frustration for not being able to know, what kind of policies government is adopting.

Debating, passing bills, making legislation and implementing those - is the work of the Parliament. Those MPs are chosen by their electorates to act in the interest of the people of India, and not to not to demonstrate, make a mockery of the temple of democracy, bring another policy paralysis and make 125 Crore people suffer for the sake of dynasty. Is there no way in the Constitution to call back such fools and correct our mistakes? Must we suffer for full five years? It's frustrating!

                            Mr. Tharoor, you are a reasonable man and so will probably agree that every lawmaker in the country has his/her own perception on every subject.  You have a perception and probably can put it across in the parliament, if you permit it to function.  If you think that there is a scope for improving it, you must permit the bill to go ahead unobstructed and then take up amendments, based on the experiences gained over a period of time.  Secondly, you were in power for most part of the period after independence.  This problem of us not being able to attract foreign investment has been there right from the beginning, what were you doing then.  It appears, your only objective is to put Gandhi/Nehru family stamp on everything that happens in the country.

                            In India arbitration may not work unless it is incorporated into the contract. The fact that 3 crores cases are pending is an ugly blot on the country. Independence of the judiciary has no meaning with so many pending cases. Why should the judiciary be independent? To refuse accountability, do very little work and not be accountable? The Indian Judicial System is a total disgrace. If courts do not dispense justice, we may as well dispense with courts themselves.

                            Dear Shashi Sir, I still read your column because it is good and makes sense. Some times you take the party line in your columns and those are tough to read. I agree all the recommendations in this column makes sense. We need SME's as arbitrators along with people with knowledge of law to arbitrate. It would have been great to have you in the ruling party than in the opposition which only obstructs. I was reading a statement from Anand Sharma that BJP should have approached congress for backroom deals on other bills. But that is belittling the parliament. Discussions were supposed to happen in Parliament and points debated. When you use the institution for other purpose like settling the scores then there is a problem.<br/>
Request you to write an article about how to make parliament work which takes good points from opposition too.

                            There is not much of a difference in the approach of UPA and BJP. When UPA introduced important bills, BJP ensured the same are not passed. Bills on FDI in Insurance, Land reform, GST etc. are testimony to the same. Now with BJP in power, the bills are more or less the same with a few changes introduced here and there, UPA is ensuring the same are not discussed and passed. Given the situation, there is nothing wrong in going through Ordinance route except that we risk ending up with inapt and inefficient governance. Something noteworthy here is, the number of ordinances brought in by Modi is exactly the same as Indira Gandhi which is one ordinance in 28 days of its governance. The best record is that of Manmohan Singh - 1 ordinance in 60 days in spite of the fact that the disruption time of both houses during UPA was 61% (LS) and 66% (RS). Considering Indira Gandhi's record on Ordinance and BJP's record on disruption, neither have any moral standing to point fingers but both have responsibility to govern efficiently &amp; honestly and oppose sensibly.

                            Heres a thought, let it go through RJ, and fix it when your sarkar comes ( I Hope it never does, or another misfortunate Indian state will go down the route of Assam where, forced demographic shift took place last 3-4 years.)

                            Wow.. so People of India send you to parliament to help with exactly these matters- to debate the bills. You don't do your work, get a salary and write an article for an online news portal for which you were paid as well. Lame, Mr. Tharoor. You should have fought internally with your party but you, by your admission have now allowed this bill to pass in a 'flawed' form. You need to be ashamed of yourself and your party.

                            Sorry Dr Tharoor....while you've gone to great lengths to point out what hasn't been incorporated in this bill you have failed to observe the critical issues that the bill does address....the sector which desperately needed this bill to clear a massive logjam (and which has a huge multiplier effect on the economy) is construction and infrastructure, and this bill does address the issues of timely arbitration completion, arbitrator appointment and arbitration costs, all of which were essential. It's frankly very difficult to take such blatantly biased oped's seriously and that's sad because you could have used your indisputably high intellect and sophisticated world view in support of the country at such a critical juncture

                            Dear Sir<br/>
I am glad that you are making a difference by saying your point and engaging in law making.<br/>
This raises hope and pray there are a few more of you, Baijayant Panda come out to engage in discussions and law making rather than shattering the popular mandate.

                            The last bill passed by congress Govt before 2014 elections (Andhra Pradesh Re Organisation bill) was a assassination of democracy in this country, Where were you Mr ? What were you doing that time?

                            Glad you accepted that the proper discussion on the bill couldn't happen because congress is boycotting the proceedings. And see, you and many others wanted to speak but couldn't because of Congress's dirty game of politics.<br/><br/>
I keep wondering why an intellectual like you (and I didn't like you until I heard your famous debate in UK) is doing in Congress? Don't join BJP or any other party but why to threat your own identity by identifying yourself with Rahul and Sonia like leaders. Think big man, you have been this close to be a UN Chief and for you, these petty politics doesn't make any sense. Wake up and show some courage. I like you but I really don't like you bowing in front of Rahul and Sonia. And I am sure there are million Indians like me who like many congress leaders but are pissed off seeing them impotent due to the pseudo charm of Gandhis.

                            We love quantity over quality. Pendency is due to adjournments granted to litigant party. Regulate adjournment and issue will be resolved to a great extend.
