Headline::::Vajpayee, The Best Congressman We Never Had?



DateTime::::2015-03-27T19:59:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
		 
	Might Atal Behari Vajpyaee be the best Congressman we never had? Given the company he has kept all his political life, he remains amazingly untainted by the vices of the family from which he has emerged - the Sangh Parivar. It was Govindacharya who chanced on this revelation when he called him a 'mukhauta'. Although it was Vajpayee who had coined the notorious equivalence between 'Hindutva' and 'Bharatiyata', it is hard to find in his words or action any extremism of the RSS kind. He seems to have instinctively learned that the exclusivism of his peers ill-suited an aspirant for the office of Prime Minister. He, therefore, kept away from Advani's Rath Yatra and the movement to demolish the Babri Masjid. 
	 
	Indeed, he was the only BJP leader of eminence to stay well out of Ayodhya that Black Sunday of 6 December 1992 when the three gumbaz of the Masjid were brought down one after the other. It was perhaps the finest moment of his political life, to be a BJP leader and yet not be part of the "Ek dhakka aur do/ Babri Masjid thod do" crowd. I do not recall his having leant his voice to the hypocrisy of the claim that Mir Baqi's structure was a not a place of worship, but a "vivadhit dhancha".
	 
	He was also much more a socialist than his peers. It was at his instance that the economic philosophy of the Bharatiya Janata Party at its foundation was described as "Gandhian Socialism", a phrase they have since abandoned. They switched to the free market only after Dr. Manmohan Singh's reforms began to get reflected in higher GDP growth figures. 
	 
	Unlike his disruptionist followers, Vajpayee loved the cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate - and, indeed, was a master of the dialectics of democracy. I remember attending a function to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the inauguration of the Lok Sabha (2002) when he bemoaned that while, in the past, MPs would walk out when they wanted to show their opposition, now the Opposition was walking in the opposite direction - right into the Well of the House. The irony is that when a couple of years later, the BJP found itself in Opposition, it made the invasion of the Well its primary instrument of politics. Had Vajpayee continued to lead the BJP in Parliament, there might have been occasional disruptions but not the forcible closing of Parliament for days on end as we witnessed in the worst period of the BJP's Rajya Sabha chief whip, S.S. Ahluwalia, who would repeatedly lead his 'shouting brigade' right up to the Chairman's elevated height. 
	 
	Illness has now muted Vajpayee's extraordinarily powerful voice but evidence of his outstanding Parliamentary abilities is available to anyone who cares to look into the parliamentary records - preferably not in English translation but in the original Hindi. He spoke impeccable Hindi, almost never using an English word. His style of delivery was peculiarly his own - jocular but with rapier trusts, never offensive but always telling. I spent hours in the Lok Sabha just listening to him speaking, fascinated by the long pauses, usually followed by a punch line. Not only did he command attention when he spoke, he was also an excellent listener, allowing the argument from the other side to flow over him without betraying anger or annoyance, without disruption. He also did me the great kindness of taking particular care to take his seat when I was on my feet. 
	 
	On one occasion, when I was commenting on the Narashimha Rao government's decision to accord full diplomatic recognition to Israel, I thundered that we must not allow the Israelis to dictate to us the religion of the person we should be sending as our first Ambassador to Tel Aviv. I heard Vajpayee asking his neighbour in a loud sage whisper, "Yeh kiski ki baat kar rahein hain?" Pat came the reply "Unke dost, Hamid Ansari ki". Hamid, then our Ministry's most accomplished West Asia expert, is now the Vice President, and as such, the chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  
	 
	Entering Parliament in 1957 at the age of 31, he quickly became the leader of his tiny Parliamentary party, but notwithstanding his party's minuscule numbers, had a voice that was listened to with much anticipation every time he rose to speak. His high moment came in October 1962 when, at the peak of the Chinese invasion, he led a four-member delegation to see Nehru to persuade him to convene the Rajya Sabha. Nehru agreed, and Vajpayee launched into a scathing attack on Nehru's foreign and defence policies. He was given his full head without interruption. It is a pity, therefore, that when the Opposition was calling for a debate on the Kargil invasion, Vajpayee ducked it, failing pathetically to rise to Nehru's stature. 
	 
	His other notable passage of arms was with C.N. Annadurai over the role of Hindi in national affairs. Both were orators par excellence in their respective mother tongues. Vajpayee had the advantage of speaking in Parliament in his mother tongue, Hindi. 'Anna' responded in faultless, free-flowing English. They kept the nation riveted until Indira Gandhi's three-language formula quieted the dispute for a while.
	 
	When in 1979, the Janata government of Morarji Desai appointed Vajpayee as Foreign Minister, my first reaction was one of alarm. Why were they appointing a right-wing, anti-Islamist to this vital portfolio? Vajpayee fooled everyone. Taking to his assignment like a duck to water, Vajpayee became the first Foreign Minister since Swaran Singh to visit Islamabad. There, he delivered his banquet speech in flawless Urdu, much to the chagrin of his Madras-born counterpart, Aga Shahi, whose Urdu was non-existent. He then quickly rushed through a programme of normalization of relations, including the reciprocal opening of Consulates-General in Karachi and Mumbai. I heard the news over the radio in Baghdad where I had completed only two of my three-year posting and would, therefore, not even be considered for the assignment. To my immense delight, a few days later, a telegram arrived transferring me to Karachi. Vajpayee, who did not know me at the time, knew nothing of why I had been selected, but in later years in Parliament he did me the great honour of waiting in the chamber, or returning to it, to hear me out on Pakistan. 
	 
	The single most severe challenge to his championship of higher values in politics came in the wake of the Gujarat pogrom. After Home Minister Advani had visited the state and given Modi a clean chit, Vajpayee went to Ahmadabad. At his press conference, he said,  "I have just one message for the Chief Minister. He must adhere to 'rajdharma'. For the King or the ruler cannot discriminate between people, whether on the basis of birth, caste or religion." So stinging was the public rebuke that Modi butted in, "Hum bhi wahi kar rahe hain, sahib." Vajpayee did not respond. It is now learnt that he intended to dismiss Modi. (I am indebted to Manoj Mitta's The Fiction of Fact-finding: Modi & Godhra for these details) 
	 
	That was the moment Vajpayee could have been considered for the Bharat Ratna. But, after having privately complained, "Is kalank ko mere moonh par laga diya", Vajpayee back-tracked - and the same Modi who had never visited a Muslim refugee camp in the aftermath of Godhra except when, for protocol reasons, he accompanied the Prime Minister to the Shah Alam camp, found his road opened to becoming Vajpayee's BJP successor in Race Course Road. That lapse makes it clear that while Vajpayee might be deserving of a high Padma award, giving him the Bharat Ratna is really going too far over the top.

                            It is a shame that person like Mani Shankar Iyer suggest that Atalji should have been given Padma Award and not Bharat Ratna.  Please Mani, dont show your loyalty to the Gandhi family and be a true Indian.  Go to your constituency and do something good for the people rather than fooling the country by writing blogs.

                            Yeah, Yeah ! we know all about Atalji, he is our Role Model.  <br/>
But I confess that I am impressed by the way you somehow find a way to yap at MODI's heels in every article of yours.  <br/><br/>
Now about "vices of the family from which he has emerged - the Sangh Parivar" and " disruptionist followers" which you have quoted above:<br/>
You know that they are the ones FIRST at sites of Natural Calamaties like, floods, earthquakes, cyclones etc who are there to help the general public in need, while expecting NOTHING in return. They are the ones (along with our Jawans) who help in removing rotting corpses, clearing debris etc. while people of your party only make a perfunctory visit in a helicopter to such sites. They are also unlike other NGO's who go to 'help' the affected, but demand their  very souls in return. They are the true heroes of the motherland unlike the people of longest ruling party of this country, who lived only to loot the country.

                            After many years some other Mani Shankar Iyer will write about MODI also like this..They do not recognize the value when these greats were/are in action. Thank God that the dynastic rule was interrupted in 1977,1999 and 2014..otherwise difficult to imagine what harm would have been caused to the country..perhaps a high commissioner in Kashmir, coal mines being handed over by direct orders from dynasty to damads, constitutional amendment to perpetuate dynasty... to think of a few.

                            Let the country know, in the last 67 years of independent India, Congress has celebrated only one festival every year in its offices. Any guesses which one was it ? It's Id. Why no Diwali dear Mani Idiot Aiyar. It's because of your minority appeasement politics that your biradri has been reduced to 44. I wish it goes down to 4. Can never vote for Congress with such rats around the country. And for records will really like to know what Indira Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi have done to have received Bharat Ratna.

Your multiple contradictions seem to suggest, though subtly, that Vajpayee ought to have been a Congressman to deserve the Bharat Ratna.  Not sure if and when you and your will grow up.

Describing him as chaiwallah and use it to run such a steong part of his campaign that congress is reduced to nonexistance... We get it... That many in your party as well as others consider you responsible for almost 30 to 40% of what happened to congress... But my friend, the damage is done... Vajpayee did great service to the nation and you not thinking him deserving of Bharat Ratna for his position in 2002 is just your hate towards Modi which again... We can understand... But is supremely unfair to Valpayi and his contribution... Anyways, doesnt matter what you say...

                            What a tribute it is! It seems that , as on today, there is no body of similar eloquence in English in the political realm of India including the BJP . All Ayyar bashers must know that Ayyar's politics and opinion on politics has never been coloured , although he gives an impression of raging at saffron like a bull at the sight of red. One is very sure that Vajpayee would have certainly prevented sowing seeds of communal hatred among the young and impressionable minds

                            Aha, ha, Aiyar, you people revered the same SS Ahluwalia when he was at his vociferous best when he was with the Congress.  This is just one of your usual endless self-goals.  By the way, Nehru's stature was never a benchmark for anyone to match and so it is no regret that Vajpayee ji did not scale up to that.  You new found love (??!!) shows desperation in the aftermath of the brute power that BJP post-ABV era that effectively decimated Congress.  You minority appeasement will never ever be accepted by the people of India.  You are not an acclaimed statesman, so don't project that you did a great job as a diplomat. Irrespective of what you hypocrites think, Vajpayee ji remains a true Bharat Ratna and the people of India know that.

                            "Vajpayee might be deserving of a high Padma award, giving him the Bharat Ratna is really going too far over the top."  Everything else was okay, but the last line of the last paragraph was a bit too dirty, even by your standards. You might feel you are a big man to comment on such an eminent personality like Vajpayeeji, but the people dont even consider you as "dirt" and they do deem you to be even lesser than that. Can you tell me the names of congress leaders who got the Bharat Ratna even when they kept on looting the country, massacaring sikhs, and other anti-national activities? Learn to be a bit gracious at least now, a couple of years before you go to the grave, because you will have at least a couple of insane people lamenting your loss....For your kind information, your nonsensical comments on policies, activities, on eminent personalities, bootlicking your leaders, etc., are never solicited by the people of this country. Your comments are as irrelevant as what rahul gandhi or the congress party is today. You keep all your comments in a diary of yours and will be referred by any one of your ugly desecendants when they come across the diary, the diary which would be felt by the rats in your house as "too dirty and smelling of sewer."

                            "Hum bhi wahi kar rahe hain, sahib." Vajpayee did not respond : This is factually incorrect. There are videos on youtube where Vajpayee is clearly responding in agreement with Modi that Modi is following rajdharma.

Where do all of the corruption, scams, colossal miscalculations, complete absence of governance, sycophancy in the extreme which were the real UPA (read congress) hallmarks in the last decade? Here you have, another sycophant of the Nehrus, occupying a lofty perch pompously, which truly is like a congressman!

Nehru put his own pride and international stature in front of the National interests and lost half of Kashmir and 1962 war.<br/><br/>
Vajpayee won the Kargil war and never considered himself above the National Interests

                            Dear Mani Sir,  Your article on the initial paras were laudable on Vajpayeeji.  But at the end you have exposed of your real colour ( disliking ).  I still of the firm belief that Rajiv Gandhi should not have been honoured with Bharat Ratna since he has not done anything which calls for this prestigeous award.<br/><br/>
Also you have pointed out of "Rajdharma" comments of Vajpayeeji on Modi and you mentioned when Mr Modi responded, ex-PM kept quiet and this one itself shows your editing of the subsequent sentence which Mr Vajpayijee did utter clearly - " Aur Karna hai" for Mr Modi's response.<br/><br/>
As usual you are always Mr Modi's baitor and you have nothing to say than bunch of lies.  It is clear still you could not just digest Mr Modiji's popularity and his single point agenda of "development".  It is sad that you become "irrelevant" and that's also one of the reasons of your spewing venom as well as lies on all unrelated.  <br/><br/>
In a way you accepted Mr Vajpayeeji the best even amongst your so called Congressmen !!!!!!!!

                            MSA displays the usual one-track-mind mentality, one who has no leaders to speak about in his own party. <br/>
Judging great giants among leaders needs wisdom &amp; maturity . Pygmies like MSA neither have the stature nor the maturity. A person whose political career has been founded largely on political sycophancy, can express such views. Not that they matter much to the public at large. <br/>
A B Vajpayee had the courage to offer good counsel to his own CM during the crises. None of the Congress leaders had the spine to stand up to the excesses &amp; wrongdoing of their so called Stalwarts. MSA, please look inside the mess inside your own party &amp; get busy cleaning it up. It would be far more  productive than sporting that perennial scowl &amp; passing comments on the true great leaders of our country .<br/>
P.S. The people of this country have given an overwhelming mandate to the same Gujarat CM  &amp; made him the PM of this country. Hope MSA does not dispute the collective intelligence of the entire nation.

As tthe PM he brought Telecom revolution , Road &amp; highway revolution (golden quuadrilateral and PM Gram sadak yojna),GDP more than 8% (first time in india's history), Nuclear explosion (which exposed the hidden nuclear weapons of Pak) ,Educational revolution (sarva siksha abhiyaan) , initiatives for RTI/RTE , Normalised relations with neighbouring countries as well as with US,Russia,China etc , restoration of Kashmiris in Indian democracy and many more. Can you tell what made Nehru to predict Atalji as the future PM ?? Atalji is the personofication of democratic,genial,noble but Strong values !! India was never so happy as it is today when he has been bestowed the Bharat Ratna !! If he did not deserved the award then so does 43 others in the list !!

                            Do you have the courage to tell the nation what was rajiv gandhi's contribution to the country, if at all, so that he deserved the Bharat Ratna? On what grounds was he given the BR? You distributed the Bharat Ratna for congress leaders just like PDS rice and as if you were doing the nation a great service. Just take a look at the list of Bharat Ratna recepients till date and you will find that the "Gandhis" stand out as odd names for the list. Indira Gandhi, at least, was a name to be considered..but rajiv gandhi? For what? I think an educated man (that is what you claim) like you should explain. Even if you dont explain, the people of India know your credentials....We can only say one good thing about the congress party and its leaders like you......a person working in a Modi chai stall like you is able to write blogs!

                            Had Congress not deviated from Gandhiji's path and chosen to please one man and his family, Congress would still be ruling India.<br/>
Gandhiji opposed partition, religious conversions, (Soviet or Nehruvian) socialism, democracy, person-worship, cow-slaughter, alcohol/tobacco and so on.<br/>
A typical non-partitioned Indian, including Muslim Indian - and a Pakistani Muslim - still sees no problems with these ideas.<br/>
Congress (including Nehru) tried to "cast" Gandhiji to its political needs. Thus it deviated from the path of truth - and from the masses.<br/>
The only advantage of leaving Gandhiji behind was industrialization. Till Congress left Nehru also behind, industrialization was more anemic and symbolic.<br/>
Essentially, Congress today has betrayed both Nehru and Gandhi. There is no wonder they see "original Congress" in everyone.

                            It is such a shame and pity that we, as a developing nation, top in the IT industry, pioneers in so many aspects in life, that we are not able to produce a single psychiatrist, neurosurgeon, or a psychiatric facility across India where this retard called mani shankar iyer can be treated. Other psychiatrists across India refuse even a consultation with this fellow fearing that they might go mad the moment they see him....The next time Modi goes overseas, he should ask the PM or President of that country if they have a rehabilitation center for mani...In fact, this is the greatest service modi can do for one of the employees of his tea stall.

                            I am regular reader of Blogs by MSI and the comments by the readers.The last sentence says "That lapse makes it clear that while Vajpayee might be deserving of a high Padma award, giving him the Bharat Ratna is really going too far over the top" This parting remark by MSI  is cheap and reveals the petty mind set of a typical Congress  sycophant of NG family. If one mishap or incident in one's long political career disqualifies Vajpayee for BR, then more questions arise about BRs to three NG family members. Did he write anytime on BRs  to Nehru for gifting POK to Pak or on IG for imposing emergency or RG for Bofors. It appears that he never cares to read the comments, perhaps mistakenly thinking that readers are fools.

                            Mr. Iyer is the most negative person I have come across. He is so much indebted to his political masters that he has no right to accept the truth!! <br/>
and Being a former Diplomat we know that he can lie with straight face!!!

                            AB Vajpayeeji on 22nd December 2002 attended the swearing in Ceremony of Narendra Modi as CM for Second Time and blessed him.. Narendra Modi brought a landslide victory for BJP. English Media internationalized the  Gujarat 2002 Riots. ABV Feared that he might loose his Post. IF BJP lost Gujarat Elections in 2002 even the Central Government would have fallen.From then till 2013 Narendra Modi brought wonderful victories to BJP in all elections in Gujarat.Regarding Vajpayee I agree with the Opinion of Dr Subramanya Swamy.

                            Give it to Aiyer. He must be the only guy who feels that Vajpayee does not deserve the Bharat Ratna! Who deserves it - Rahul Baba perhaps? If they can find him that is. But give Aiyer his due. In spite of the repeated Congress failures, he still stands and fights for his party. Even though the party has made it clear that it has no use for him. His loyalty to HMV is awesome.

                            Like always Mr. Aiyar is confused. Does he wanted Mr. Vajpayee in Congress or show his indebtness to Mr. Vajpayee on his political abilities or like congressmen politicize the Bharat Ratna. Please look at the persons who have been awarded Bharat Ratna during Congress time. Several flaws can be seen. We must respect the person and his contribution. Learn the good ones and proceed.

                            When the useless Rajiv  Gandhi was given BR because he was  the dynasty, when MGR was given because he gave away tax money free for all, and many more useless people getting this award This idiot MSI did not open hid mouth. He is the stooge of the dynasty who cannot even get his deposit from his constituency, talking nonsense. Mr  MSI why don't you at least make Congress get 1% more votes in the next election in Tamilnadu and then talk and write.

                            I am utterly surprised and disappointingly amazed that a person of Mani Shankar Aiyer's stature and caliber writes such one sided cynical appreciation of a statesman like Vajpayee ji. For him Rahul Gandhi is a great leader- and this explains his views. <br/><br/>
Mr. Aiyer, please pick up Jan Sangh's election manifesto in 1977 followed by BJP's manifesto in 1984/1989/1991- all these manifesto's provide the road map of what Manmohan singh and Narasimha Rao did in 1991. This was the tacit understanding between Rao and Vajpayee and thus the opposition never intended to challenge a monority government in the center- since the govt was following the opposition's policies.

                            Where was this Iyer when congress governments after governments were conferring BRs to the Royal Gandhi families and neglected the greatest leaders of this country including Vajpayji for the award ...Now Iyer woke up from dreams , took a tea from Modi Tea Stall and started writing ... Iyer you go on writing .. when you write each time , you are putting more nails on congress grave.... Good for the nation as you help simultaneously BJP to wipe off congress from Indian political scene with the Royal family you support without shame ...

                            If Manishankar Aiyar thinks that Vajpayee is the best Congressman they never had, why didnot Congress government give him Bharat Ratna? They played all politics when it was to be given. They gave it people like Sachin Tendulkar and denied Vajpayee for 10 years. And now to project that they are also supportive to this award they are playing politics and twisting words.<br/><br/>
Being Congressman doesnot become saint and all RSS related or likers are not devils. People have understood this now and will not pay heed to the stupid comments of Mani Aiyar

                            Here goes once again our Mooney Shankar... Now please don't belittle the honor bestowed upon him (Bharat Ratna) by calling him a Congressman (who never was)! I had great respect for NDTV &amp; I am deeply disappointed that it is indulging the idiocies of a rabid, sycophantic rantings of a rightly defeated individual. I request the current government to give him some job like selling idli-dosa (I am not a racist when I say this - I belong to the same ethnic background as Mooney!) outside the BJP (or for that matter any party's) convention. They say he was a professor in US previously. I am sure he would have been kicked out.

What great deed they have parted to our society?<br/>
Just because, he got a column to write and to sensationalize his presence(anyhow, his own constituency he lost the relevance) he his writing these barbs.<br/><br/>
Mani - You don't have to be elected Member to serve your consitituency. If you really served the people, irrespective of wave or Tsunami you would have elected from Mayiladurai Constituency. Take Kamal Nath - he has been elected irrespective of his party butchering.<br/><br/>
Do it in action Mani - stop stoopping so low. Just for being relevance in Politics.

                            Right wing fanatics reading these column abuse the columnist instead of dissecting the column. Modi-ram has completely wasted the 10-month enjoyment at Race course road. He fooled 1.2Billion people by his words. Now he is fully exposed in his Rs. 10L suit. He will go down as the biggest cheat in Indian democracy.

                            Congress has made poverty its business, not eliminating it, but keeping it alive and well through its defunct populous policies. Otherwise Congress will not be relevant. Country after country has pushed well ahead of India. India still has more poor then anywhere else on the planet - primary contribution of Congress.

                            It is a pity and most unfortunate that incompetent and eternally partisan people like Mani Shankar Iyer should make comments about the star statesman Vajpayee as to what national award Vajpayee deserves. Disrupting parliament proceedings has always been the birth right of all parties in the opposition benches. Looks like Mani Shankar has chosen to forget the number of times his pseudo-secular party has effectively indulged in this!      <br/><br/>
To say the least, he is no comparison to Modi - in any and every respect! How true, people say idle mind is devil's workshop! Mani's workshop is extremely busy!
