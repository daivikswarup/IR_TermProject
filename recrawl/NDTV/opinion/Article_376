Headline::::Michelle Obama, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? Why the Sulk



DateTime::::2015-01-27T19:46:00+05:30



(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Let's find a scapegoat. It was the fog over Delhi that got her down. That, and the unseasonal winter rain. But, hello, does that justify Michelle Obama coming across as pretty much another grumpy American tourist, tagging along with a busy husband? She is the most-watched First Lady on the planet. And the questionÂ  everybody is asking is this: why did Michelle Obama undertake the long and rushed trip to India's capital, when she was neither really seen nor heard from? The last time she was here, she had "rocked India" according to her husband, Barack (we are all on over-familiar, first name-terms with the most powerful man in the world, encouraged by the proximity and chumminess displayed toward POTUS by the second most important man in the world - Narendra Modi). Barack reminded journos that on his wife's virgin trip to our humble shores, Michelle had danced and smiled and done the whole 'American First Lady in the Third World' thing! We had been charmed and disarmed by the missus, and her eloquent husband. But, he quickly warned us, he can't dance... and he wouldn't be wearing a Modi Kurta (thank you, Sir, for sparing us). What happened this time? Why was Michelle Obama so out of it? Did she feel sartorially upstaged by the Indian Prime Minister's fashion show? She needn't have. We are still cringing! Narendra Bhai is no Style Bhai, we concluded, after he made the biggest fashion faux pas known to mankind - he wore his ego on his sleeve, and his chest, and his back! That 'pin-striped' suit really and truly did the man in. And placed him in the company of two other megalomaniacs - Hosni Mubarak and Evander Holyfield. But Michelle was no belle -she had lowered her much-highlighted fashion antenna and apparently worn something thrown at her by uninspired stylists. Bibhu Mahapatra will definitely lose a few ardent fans after this disaster. But supposedly, it could have been worse. And she wasn't having a bad hair day. So, what was her trip about?First Ladies have an important role to play. While their husbands go off to sort out the problems of the universe, the gals are expected to show a bit of interest in social issues confronting the people of the host country. Most pick an NGO to visit. Meet underprivileged kids. And/or distressed, disenfranchised women. Make an obligatory chakkar of the Dilli Haat. And go home loaded with arty-crafty junk. Michelle did none of this. She rested in her suite and had her hair done. Ummmm - she travelled thousands of miles to India to get her hair done? Catch up on some sleep?Here's what I think - and my conclusions are based on nothing more substantial than judging Michelle's unusual conduct from her public appearances. It's about reading her facial expressions and decoding her body language. I think she had had a scrap with her husband. A scrap serious enough for her to make it apparent to onlookers. Look at her cold and studied deportment during the entire duration of the Republic Day parade. She was seated at a safe distance from her husband - I find that a little odd - does protocol demand it? There was zero eye contact between the two, forget an exchange of smiles. President Obama concentrated on chewing Nicorette, while she stared stonily ahead. It's possible, she was a little relieved the Taj Mahal visit was cancelled, or else the First Couple would have been obliged to share the famous 'Love Bench' and fake it.There have been a few discreet murmurs in the recent past about trouble in the Obama paradise. It must be really difficult for Michelle to manage her emotions, whether in public or otherwise, if there is any truth to the stories. While the world watches, calibrates and judges every blink and twitch, couples in this unique position are compelled to play act - hold hands when the cameras are on them, for example. The Obamas have consistently projected a picture of the ideal and idealized American family. Michelle has done her bit to promote and protect this cherished image.Something happened in India that held back the popular First Lady from participating more fully in events during a historic visit that is equally important to both nations. As the Obamas left New Delhi to attend the funeral of King Abdullah in Riyadh, Michelle was clad in uber trendy bell bottoms. She seemed to have got her groove back. Well, sartorially, at any rate. We'll forgive her for not being herself while she was our 'mehmaan'. Hota hai. But the next time - if there is one - Michelle darling, go ahead and give your husband hell in private, if you wish. But do smile for us in public. And one more thing, honey - ditch your stylist.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Shobha De, get a life instead of conjecturing and that too completely off the mark about reasons for Michelle Obama's demeanor during the trip. Michelle Obama at the events that she attended was completely gracious, attentive and genuine in her interactions, and I say this as I was present at two of the three public events she attended. The fact that she is as accomplished as her husband and was his boss when they met adds to her persona as being willing to stand and serve in his shadow while he hogs all the glory. So someone supposedly liberated  and standing up for women like Ms. De should know better than to expect her to smile like a marionette and be a pinup girl wearing outfits to suit Ms. De's taste. While there was speculation about whether she would come at all since this is their second visit and Mr. Modi  does not have a spouse in residence, it could also be interpreted that she chose to accompany her husband and not necessarily to jump through the hoops of attending first lady in the absence of resident first lady.  Throughout the trip and at the town hall speech at Siri Fort there was a great deal of warmth shared between the President and First Lady, which may not have been apparent to Ms. De in Mumbai. She also wasn't wearing bell bottoms when she left, but was in a dress. Stop dreaming, making things up, Shobha De and at least do a fact check. NDTV do we really need to read this drivel????

                            I congratulate for your subtle and precise observation. You have really micro EYES. I appreciate your expressions. They are really lovely. I also felt the same what you described in your writings. I look forward to your writings on these lines. Your observation especially has been spontaneous (I mean without the background of any thought) and that is the reason it is beautiful to read - at least this time. So, please write spontaneously hereafter. If you think before you write, then it will corrupt the writings as thought is partial. Thank you again.

                            @test: I agree. I also find this article to be deeply sexist towards women, although its written by a woman herself. <br/><br/>
Some women blame men for being judgemental on issues like where women go and what women wear but don't realize that they themselves are overly judgemental on other women. <br/><br/>
I don't understand why Shobha should character-assasinate Ms. Obama just because she made a trip to India.

                            Michael was very graceful through out the event. If she was unhappy, it would be because of uncouth behavior of one our bureaucrats. Couldn't PM Modi get a lady companion (Some one from his ministry or bollywood) to accompany him realizing President Obama is coming with his wife. I did feel sad for Michael sitting all alone away from her husband and without proper company all through the parade. It speaks pretty bad of our Mehaman Nawazi.

                            The entire article is about what PM Modi and Michelle wore during Republic Day stirred by the criticism on why the first lady failed to depict her true emotions in public glare. Looks like De forgot that the visit was not about what she wore and how she talked; but the serious business that Obama and Modi need to do for the future to enhance relations between the two nations. So stop being so cynical about the choices people make in wearing clothes.
