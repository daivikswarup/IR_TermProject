Headline::::Modi Government Has Lost Face, Big Time



DateTime::::2015-08-20T18:38:00+05:30




                                I'm a very keen observer of the dynamic that exists between India and Pakistan. I follow each twist and turn, each up and down with undiluted interest. I weigh each word, whether spoken or written, for hidden meaning. In all the years that I've followed developments between the two countries, I've never seen a situation like the one that is playing out these days - a scheduled dialogue that both would rather not proceed with. What makes what has been happening over the last few weeks more like the theatre of the absurd is that rather than call off the dialogue, each side has been trying to force the other to take the decision.
It all began in Ufa in Russia where against the direction of play, PM Modi sat down to talk with his Pakistani counterpart. There was no build-up to this meeting, seemingly little preparation and, given the general atmosphere of hostility, little expectation that the meeting would be anything other than a photo-opportunity. The Prime Ministers both came together to pull a proverbial rabbit out of their shared hat when a joint statement was agreed and read out by the Foreign Secretaries of both countries. It was seen as a victory for PM Modi with the Pakistani side agreeing to keep any mention of Kashmir out of the joint statement, while agreeing to mention justice for the 26/11 attacks. I wrote an opinion piece for NDTV immediately after Ufa and nothing has happened after I did to suggest that I was wrong to not be optimistic about the developments. 
One of the key outcomes of Ufa was the scheduling of talks at the level of the National Security Advisors. From what I can recall, this is the first time talks between the two country's NSAs have been scheduled like this.
The build up to the NSA-level talks has been anything but smooth with everything that could be done to derail the process thrown in to the mix. To start with, Pakistan was anything but keen to fix a date. The dates proposed by India were met with stony silence for the longest time. At one point, it looked as though for want of a reply from Pakistan the talks would not take place at all.
The last few weeks have seen major terror attacks in Gurdaspur and Udhampur, both areas in Punjab and Jammu respectively that haven't seen terror attacks in many years. The BJP's oft tom-tommed line, while in opposition, that talks and terror couldn't go together was put to the most severe test. Infiltration attempts continued unabated and the Line of Control (LoC) has seen a major escalation in ceasefire violations, particularly in the Poonch region of Jammu. These violations have targeted civilian populations with a number of deaths and injuries. Curiously, while all this was unfolding, PM Modi maintained a steadfast silence with no reference to any of these developments either on Twitter or in his address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day.
The only possible conclusion that one could draw from all this was that Pakistan wanted to give the Indian side a reason to call off the talks, and do so without taking too much of the blame. India stubbornly withstood the attacks, the infiltration and the ceasefire violations while refusing to pull back from the planned meeting. 
This is where things took a bizarre turn, one I must confess I've never seen before. Pakistan pulled out its trump card - an invitation to the Hurriyat leaders to meet Sartaj Aziz, the Pakistani NSA, before the meeting with his Indian counterpart. Recall, if you will, the Indian reaction to a similar invitation before the scheduled Foreign Secretary level talks in July 2014. India reacted with a swift, harsh, no-nonsense approach not seen before, the talks were called off, and a line drawn in the sand - no Hurriyat meetings will be tolerated. So the invite to the separatists to Pakistan must have seemed like a sure-shot way of getting India to do what it's thus far been refusing to do - oblige Pakistan by being the bad guy and calling off the NSA talks. 
Except that isn't what happened. In another bizarre and new twist, no cancellation announcement followed the invitation to the Hurriyat. Instead, the central government got its ally in Srinagar, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, to place the invited separatist leaders under house arrest to prevent them from traveling to Delhi to meet Pakistan's NSA Sartaj Aziz. Now the onus was on Pakistan to call off the talks since they couldn't been seen to be accepting this Indian strong-arming tactic. Of course there were reactions on expected lines with the supporters of the Modi government lauding this step as another indicator of the famed 56 inch no-nonsense chest, and so called anti-national apologists for the Hurriyat like yours truly severely critical of the decision. 
No sooner had I and many others registered their unhappiness with the decision and Mufti Sayeed's spineless conduct that news broke that the hitherto detained leaders had suddenly found themselves free to travel. A pair of confused governments in Srinagar and Delhi decided to give even more evidence of just how confused they were, as if more evidence were needed to make the case! I can imagine a lot of very satisfied people in Islamabad and Srinagar - the sidebar was now the central headline piece. 
Predicting what will happen between India and Pakistan is fraught with enormous risk, but I'll live dangerously here and stick my neck out. Here's what I think will happen - the talks will go ahead as scheduled, and the Hurriyat will meet Aziz after the talks, over a cup of tea (their current invite is for dinner at the Pakistani High Commission on Sunday). The Modi government will claim this change as a major victory for their strong stand while remaining silent on all the contradictions and dilutions that this actually means. Mufti Sayeed will remain silent in the misplaced hope that he can count on notoriously short public memory, and people will forget that his strings are pulled from outside the state. Pakistan will be able to wash off the sins of having remained silent on Kashmir in Ufa by claiming this as a victory of their Kashmir position, and the Hurriyat will just claim this as a clear indicator that they are the true representatives of the Kashmiri people.
I wish the government of India attached as much importance to not losing face as the Chinese do, because today, the Modi government has lost face, big time. There are two losers and two winners today with the Modi and Mufti governments the clear losers, displaying what can only be termed as gold medal-winning skills in twisting, turning and back tracking. The clear winners are the government of Pakistan and the Hurriyat for self-evident reasons. 
If this is how India-Pakistan engagements are going to handled over the next four years, God help us. (Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I agree fully. Embarrassingly amateurish display by Modi and Doval. They look confused and weak - very Manmohan like. <br/><br/>
What were they thinking?? I sincerely hope Modi stops spending all his time and attention on foreign trips and expensive dinners. There is serious work to be done at home first. His attention seems to be elsewhere.

                            Why do you ask your brother in law Sachin Pilot why they did not do anything for 10 years . As far as I am concerned all you in politics are for yourself and do not care about the country. You and your father talk 2 different things. Try and speak with one voice from the family.  You are half Indian so cannot have same love for india as full Indian would have.

                            Stop tweeting your ignorance and incompetence. You and your close friend RaGa wasted the precious years at your command. Now you both want to play spoilsport when Modi is taking command on all fronts and desperate Pak is on the mat. Sad and unfortunate that politics by losers is harming the country to this extent. Both of you will be out of power for the next 20 years and out of public memory by then.

                            Every country must have one or two problems to keep it alive for the benefits thats beyond reach of ordinary citizens understanding. India has a problem of 'Pakistan' which has been there and will be there forever. From 1947, we have had enough of brilliant politicins, officers and situation to solve this issue but yet it is there. If Mahatma Gandhi, Nehur, Sardar Patel, Indira, Bajpayee and many more couldnt solve it than what makes you think NaMo is capable? Lets get real.!!!!

                            Slightly out of context...but might drive home my point....<br/><br/>
I happened to see Rajesh Pilots interview about the Mumbai blasts (for which Yakub Memon was hanged)...In 1993 we were saying Pakistan should not test our patience...The many other blasts happened and we said the same thing...Pakistan should not test our patience....Finally Kasab happened...The statement still was Pakistan should not test our patience.  For decades.....the statements have been exactly the same...albeit the individuals have changed; ruling party was still the same...And look at today....So its not as horrible as Omarji is trying portray....We have been directionless and Senseless since 1948...Hamari akaal ghaas charne chali jaati hai...<br/><br/>
So while the ex-CM of J&amp;K has some valid points...he is criticizing for the heck of it.  Having said that...his father has been an amazing; realistic; passionate and truthful human.  If we had few more politicians on those lines then maybe we would be better place....

NSA talk is important,  This is new beginning. <br/><br/>
There are big brain seating in Delhi to handle our elder son Pakistan on border and national issues. <br/><br/>
Indian media looks more worried than Pakistan media doing biopsy of every word and action, Media should support government initiative.

                            Instead of writing blogs and flaming YOUR government, why can't Omar fly to Delhi and talk to the Government and come up with an Indian response to Pakistan. No matter which party you belong to you say the same thing. Leave your party politics aside for India. Once you do that then you see the difference in Pakistan.

                            Mr Abdulla, if you are very serious of resolving Kashmir issue and bringing back peace in Kashmir than support to abolish article 370. This will enable people from India to settle in Kashmir and take it to mainstream of India. Else keep you suggestions to yourself, we have seen how you guys eat from India and sympathies to Pakistan.

                            Its good to see so much being written against the current government. I would like to point a few things;<br/>
&gt; I'm not a subject matter expert ( read "Foreign Policy") but may I ask Omar Abdullah what had he or his respected father along with the congress achieved in the last 60+ plus year post independence. Is it not the Congress which had been at the centre for a major portion of time?<br/>
&gt; Foreign Policy - as i understand based on what ever limited knowledge I have is ever evolving. Infact very dynamic as far dealing with a country like Pakistan is concerned. Again, why do we forget - was there a Pakistan 68 year back ! No.... Its a nation formed by division of Bharat. Again why was the nation split ? there are various theories on the same but the actual truth has been hidden by the INC - INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS for obivious reasons. So coming back to dealing with Pakistan - as I understand - the main issue with Pakistan is they are a nation which is low in morale and highly insecured. When they compare themselves with India they feel frustrated - be it in any field. Science,Technology,Arts, Music, Business we are way ahead of them. ( Please don't compare by saying Indian land mass is much larger than Pakistan - compare with a tiny country like Singapore !). Further time and again the Indian National Congress has bullied Pakistan which has made them what they are !. <br/>
&gt; PM Modi is not even 18 months old in the office and we start expecting him to clean everthing at one go ! Come on ... grow up guys. I not saying this because I'm a Modi fan... but the reasoning has been logical.<br/>
&gt; Please understand there will be unrest only when the state ignores its people.

                            I thought of reading this piece by reading its title, but then I happen to see the writer. I scrolled down to comments section. Its very funny for me to see what is happening in India. One Modi has put everyone on their toes. Everyone means everyone from Media to Political parties. I never happen to see so much enthusiasm about ONE PERSON in the past 20 years. It is all the attention that Modi is getting that has made him what he is today. Seems those politicians, media houses and the topline of the government administration is worried about Modi's Presence around India. Every one knows of the word Modi (Mr. Narendra Modi). There is a clear sense of insecurity among other political parties. One more thing I am not a Modi fan but I am find it very amusing the amount of importance that he is getting from other political parties who are trying to find Modi anywhere and everywhere they can by hook or by crook.

                            Is this theater organised for the consumption of third party ? Indo-Pak are behaving as if they have to blame each other if talk derails and war break out . If true, then this talk is a step towards war , third party intervention and snowballing Kashmir issue for the satisfaction of Pakistan. Writing is on the wall just read it and avoid  debacle.

                            The BJP does appear to be searching, without a definite plan. If you are anti-BJP and want to celebrate, go ahead. But if you are pro India, what is clear is that Modi is trying to help Sharif against his military. The military pushes the Hurriyat angle. Sharif pushes the talks angle. That is why we see twists and turns.

                            Dear Mr. Abdullah,<br/><br/>
It is not the Modi government that has lost face, it is the Pakistan establishment. Do they need a more resounding slap than the cancellation of Commonwealth Speaker's Meet in Islamabad? It is a different matter that Indian media has hidden all of that behind the coverage of "talks" news. Instead of saying, like all previous governments used to mouth, "no talks unless Pakistan gives up terrorism and then not sticking to it, this government has made terrorism the subject of talks. No third party, no back door dialogues. A sea change. Successful and difficult to digest. Understandable.<br/><br/>
Regards
                         </div>

                            Keeping these elements in detention was right. However whats the point of releasing them and allowing them to meet the Pak NSA. If they are not the "the THIRD PARTY" then why this legitimacy and arrange them to meet the visiting NSA but only for them to tom tom that the GOI is scared of them.

                            Give some solution Mr. Farooq Abdullah, you are leader and leader must find solution which is acceptable for all stakeholders. People from India, Pakistan and Kashmir has been suffering a lot since the last 68 years and it is enough and should be stopped. They have the right to move forwards for the prosperity of the region for their new generation.

What is keeping them going is Mr Modi's roadshow to entertain the NRI's.

                            Omar Abdullah, you are no better. I have been observing you since a long time. You are taking full advantage of the unrest and mess in Kashmir for your personal gains (power). Selfishness abounds in all your acts. The children born in Kashmir are so unfortunate to have this mess. But people like you don't really want peace, because you will not benefit from it.

                            This is another example of Prime Minister Modi assuming that his persona alone can make things happen in foreign policy. He did the same with the Chinese Premier but with hardly any effect on trade; he did the same with Obama, addressing him even by his first name Barak, with little impact on the outcomes. This way of thinking and acting is very very unprofessional. Without involving experienced bureaucrats, ministry officials and respective departments, counting merely on one's personal chemistry with leaders of other nations, makes this whole approach apperar puerile. Does this not exhibit a personal trait where the person thinks that he and he alone can manage things without the help of the state apparatus? Something is seriously amiss here. This is affecting partliamentary procedures by way of failing to manage the opposition, foreign policy as demonstrated with these scheduled talks, and within the administration where all the ministries appear to be redundant.

                            Modi's Team India (repeat 40 times) directionless foreign policy especially towards Pakistan has created total chaos. We don't know who is the FM,  Sushma, Modi, Doval or Jaitely ? This uncertainty of direction has given an upper hand  to Pakistan for the first time. This Govt should take advice from the seasoned foreign policy, Security and Defence experts to workout a clear future direction. Mr Modi is all out to undo everything which the earlier governments including that of Mr Bajpai have followed/done. His  arrogant attitude and approach will do no good to India in the long run. Pakistan establishment will never ever give up its hostilities (overt or covert) and Kashmir issue, as these are the life lines of Pakistan Army.

                            This is the best outcome for any talk so far. From now on<br/>
(1) Talk will be only about terror<br/>
(2) No Hurriyat - The chapter started in 1999 will be closed. They have to decide whether to become MLAs or terrorists. If it is latter they should be exiled. When Pandits can be thrown out of valley, why Hurriyat who pose a national security challenge as proved through their friendship with Hafeez Saeed, be anywhere in India. May be one of the four houses of Dawood Ibrahim?

                            Historically whenever anywhere in the world there is a totalitarian regime that wants to crush its citizenry - 99% it is acting at the behest of some foreign power.

                            The biggest problem with Modi govt is they want a solution where as Pakistan doesn't want a solution. They just want to keep it boiling. This is what they need to understand and comeup with alternative solution. Make Pakistan bleed as much as possible.

                            Kashmir problem was created by a king of Kashmir who wants to remain a king of an independent Hindu nation like Nepal. But he fails to recognize his strength and when death comes to his neck he agreed to a conditional surrender to India and rest is history. Now the same mistake separatist leaders are committing that they fail to understand if they get the freedom, will they able to maintain it. Within an hour, Pakistan will make them to surrender and this time India will not come to save them at the cost of own growth. Instead of remaining permanent salve to Pakistan, their future is very much bright with India as India is protecting them at the cost of own development to honor the accord of safety between king of Kashmir and India.

                            It is absurdity and lunacy at its best when I read through Mr Omar's Opinion piece and the comments here from all the others who have taken the opportunity to criticize Mr. Modi's government on this NSA level talks including the Media. I don't comprehend the dynamics of J&amp;K and neither do more than 98% of the Indians including the people of J&amp;K themselves. Common man opinion is either politically motivated or a victim of mis-representation and wrong information but certainly distorted. We have a neighbor who is playing a game of cat and mouse shifting positions every other day and none so ever interested in solving this through diplomacy. Having said that, Mr Omar Abdullah, it was absolutely fantastic the way you handled security situation in Kashmir and frankly you almost make it seem as though the region was conflict free under UPA/Nation Conference rule in J &amp; K. If as you claim are a keen observer and follow developments in J&amp;K, then for once be selfless, don't wait for your party to come back to power, setup a meeting with Mr. Modi (without expecting him to invite you to seek your opinion, since you are no God), offer to be a mediator, suggest a solution which is agreeable to all stake holders (India, Pakistan) and those who claim to be stake holders (separatists, terrorists), work with them and solve this problem once for all. If you can manage to do this you will be bestowed with Nobel Prize for Peace. Don't write columns at length to criticize someone's effort. If you have something constructive to offer, please do, else shut up and mind your own business.

                            I am sorry to say that Modi seems to be a coward who only fights people in India (retired military, common citizen etc.). He must have done the same with people of Gujarat (political opponents, police, common man). He is good for Bhashans in poll bound states and to the NRI audience overseas. Pakistan is a country that has exploited 9/11 to its advantage on a global level and one needs a lot of diplomatic skills, depth in character and global good will to counter them; alternatively it needs a strong Indian state - both of which does not seem to be happening.
