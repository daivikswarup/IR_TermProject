Headline::::The Sena-BJP Alliance Running Out Of Steam



DateTime::::2015-04-14T14:48:00+05:30



(Kumar Ketkar is a senior journalist, political commentator, globe trotter and author. He has covered all Indian elections since 1971 and significant international events. He is a frequent participant on TV debates.)
Yet again, there is an organized effort to raise communal passions in Mumbai. But mercifully, no violence has erupted. Not because the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance has become tolerant or secular, but because the divisive and aggressive language used by Sanjay Raut, the Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member and editor of Samna, has not found takers in the state.The reason that Mumbai did not get unduly alarmed is because within the Shiv Sena, many leaders or activists do not support the style and substance of Sanjay Raut's politics. He has raised the issue when the Sena is completely fractured into many factions. No faction would like to burn its fingers, and stake its future electoral prospects by supporting him right now. The election for the wealthy Mumbai Corporation is less than two years away. It is a very prestigious election. The Municipal budget of the Metropolis is larger than many states in India. Bollywood, the stock market and cricket, the three major mass-based institutions which define the societal fabric of Mumbai have remained steadfastly secular and liberal. Business is dominated by Gujarat and Marwari communities, as also Punjabi and Parsi; they have a stake in co-existence, not ideologically, but purely out of self-interest and survival.Mumbai, despite the ranting and rhetoric of the Uddhav-led Shiv Sena or Raj-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has remained true to its spirit of cosmopolitanism and cooperation; voters have roundly routed the MNS and brought the Shiv Sena to its knees. The so-called Marathi votebank is split. It was never really a Marathi vote bank anyway. Marathi voters have voted for the Congress, the BJP, the RPI and so on. They have voted for the BJP even when it had called off its alliance with the Sena. There was a time when the BJP felt obliged to play second-fiddle to the Sena.  At the time, we had an India of "class divide". The middle class Marathi-Maharashtrian with upper-caste roots was close to the Sangh Parivar and the BJP. The economically lower middle class, a section of the working class, some lumpens and  unemployed youth were the Sena supporters. Later, even that base was broken up, with a younger and militant lumpen joining Raj Thackeray's MNS.Raj Thackeray has not joined the Sanjay Raut bandwagon, if indeed, he has one. Not a single Sena minister in the Fadanvis government has even mildly endorsed the line. It is unlikely that Raut was unaware of this lack of enthusiasm for his communal campaign. Then what did he want to achieve? Or rather what has he achieved? He has embarrassed his leader Uddhav. He has embarrassed the state BJP leadership. But he has also created a rift in the alliance before the Muncipal Election.Veteran politicians in the staet like Sharad Pawar and Narayan Rane have already begun to say that the state government is on tenterhooks. Not because of a threat from the opposition, but from detractors within the alliance. There is talk that the BJP-Sena partnership will break on the eve of the Municipal Elections. It is at then that there will be some new arrangement of political forces is likely to take shape. Pawar has maintained a close relationship with the Sena (read Sanjay Raut !). His NCP may have an underground treaty with the BJP, with Modi declaring publicly that Pawar is his Guru, but the Marathas who dominate the NCP are not comfortable with a Brahmin as  Chief Minister. Brahmins constitute less than 4 per cent of the state population and Marathas are around 36 per cent (with Kunbis).It is significant that despite the end of the Congress-NCP relationship, Pawar campaigned intensely for the Congress candidate Narayan Rane for the by-election in the Bandra East constituency. Rane, formerly a  militant Shiv Sainik and Sena Chief Minister in 1999, today swears that the Sena is his Enemy No1. The BJP is keen to marginalize the Sena before the Municipal election, and hence has not helped their fraternal candidate. The picture will be clear once the results of the by-election in  Bandra are announced tomorrow (April 15). If  the Shiv Sena wins, it will not entertain Raut's views as they won't be compatible with Mumbai life. If the Sena loses to Rane, then they will have to find another agenda and reposition themselves vis-a-vis the BJP.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            BJP - Sena running out of steam in Maharashtra. Modi &amp; BJP running out of steam in India. Time to bring Prince Rahul or Princess Priyanka. That will be pleasing thing for likes of Ketkar. These people have never done any positive journalism in their life. That is their big problem. And there are many like him in India that is our problem.

                            India's ratings in improved by several foreign agencies for economic &amp; business environment which was downgrade year on year during UPA regime. Kumar Ketkar needs to accept change. If not then wait for Rahul and he will give you bharat ratna...like they have given to Saif Ali Khan.

                            If abc happens 123 will be the outcome, If xyz happens 456 will be the outcome. Is this the analysis of a "VETERAN JOURNALIST" (And I am not accusing KK to be a journalist). His open hate for BJP SENA RSS &amp; open blind love for Nehru lineage &amp; all this under the garb of "JOURNALISM" is becoming farcical day by day.

                            The Brahmins of Maharashtra have been at the forefront of casteism. Their philosophy of if I can't get something then I will not let others also to have it made them untrustworthy with the other groups. They played one group against the other by using the dominant position self-assumed within Hinduism. Their lust for political power led them to launch slanderous accusations on Royal Maratha rulers. This created rifts between them and the ruling section of Marathas (not Kunbis). Having said this the author is right when he says the upper crust Maratha was never with Shiv Sena which is a party of lower class, lumpen and unemployed.

Unless Kelkar introduces himself as BJP hater and/or Congress /Nehru clan servant,NDTV or any other media space should not be given to him. He calls himself a journalist and political commentator.He is too prejudiced to be any where close to these descriptions.One must be truthful when introducing oneself in public space.He should not be allowed to mislead the public about him self and glorify him self through deceipt.How many times and how many countries and howmany days a year, he trots the globe to justify that description. Can he atleast come clean on that.These are highly prejudiced, parasite like people with mountain size ego.Seems that channels and websites need somebody to fill the time and space. sorry state of Media?????

                            'Globe Trotter' Ketkar goes on and on but his ranting is of no consequence.  Other than TV studios who need somebody to fill space, he is not taken seriously by anybody other than himself.  His analysis, like him, is worth nothing!

                            Oh! Kumar again!!<br/>
This chap has his head filled with hatred towards Hindus,in general and BJP-Sena in particular. He has turned blind eye towards atrocities carried by Congress in various states and by Communists while the party was rulin West Bengal. This man will never write about a Christian Religious leader exploiting nuns and sisters ( so many cases in Kerala) and will never ever write a word about Muslims, He will support any stand taken by Muslim militants and never support the dowry case-Shah Banoo.<br/>
He has never used recycle activite to refresh his tiny brain. He should go for formatting his small and big brain.........

                            Kelkarji, its high time congress to improve its public image by doing some constructive work in the interst of larger interest of Farmers, Industrial Workers, Unorganized Workers, IT Wokers and removing inefficiant party loyalist from the congress party. Also they have needs to get rid of people of criminal backgrouns and corrupt as well as money power. people are by and large allergic to these kind of politicians. So far as Uddhav and Raj Thakre is concerned they have their vote bank among local ambitious youths who use their platform for promoting their business and political careers. They surface whtn there is vaccum in ruling party and opposition is weak they become natural choice. I think its high time morethan any other political party Congress needs your advice to improve its rank and file.

                            It never had any steam. BJP stands alone and will deliver alone. Shiv Sena, very muck like Congress and its various allies is a One family says, goes party. BJP is the only party that has democracy. Rest are just an opportunity to vent ambitions of various families. Congress is searching hard and fast for their missing leader, as that leader can come only from the first family. So this article is kind of also pointless. And so predictable.
