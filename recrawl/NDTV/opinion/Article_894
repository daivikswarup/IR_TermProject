Headline::::I Was Circumcised When I Was a Girl of 7



DateTime::::2015-10-30T15:46:00+05:30




                                One day when I was around seven, my grandmother took me to the Bohra mohalla (at Bhendi Bazaar in Mumbai) with a promise of buying me some chocolate and ice-cream.
Gladly I went. Grandmother took me to an old, decrepit looking building in the narrow gullies. We went to the first floor and entered a home; she led me to an inside room; there was a woman there who drew the curtains and asked me to lie down. I was petrified by then, and was clutching onto my grandmother's hand. This woman who made me lie down, pulled down my pants and held my legs while grandma held onto my hands. I was just so scared, I didn't know what was happening. The lady said it would just take a minute and there will be just a little pain. I just clutched my grandmother's hand and closed my eyes. There was a nick, and then she pulled my pants up and told me to go.
I went home and hugged my mother and cried. My mom told me it was alright, I would be fine. She explained to me that it would hurt when I would pee but the pain would soon subside. This horrific incident has stayed with me all my life.
I was too small to understand what happened to me and nobody explained it to me either.
I was hurt, scared and scarred by this one incident in my otherwise very happy childhood.
It was only as an adult that I realized what had happened to me on that day was Female Genital Mutilation (FGM, also known as female circumcision and 'Khatna').
This was more than four decades ago. The practice continues till date in my community.
I belong to the Dawoodi Bohra community which is a small, prosperous, highly-visible Shi'a Muslim sect based in Western India. The Bohras are an exclusivist, conservative, male-dominated society; however, interestingly, the women are seemingly proud of the measure of independence they have achieved and often describe their sect as egalitarian in its treatment of men and women in education, marriage and basic freedoms. Yet, they observe several conservative, male-dominated traditions, one of them being the practice of female circumcision.
 
Mumbai is a city of approximately 22 million people, 17 percent of whom are Muslims. Asghar Ali Engineer in his book The Bohras attributes the origins of this sect with the arrival of Shia Ismaili missionaries in early 11th century AD, to the port of Cambay from Egypt via Yemen. These missionaries found converts among Indian traders, largely in Gujarat, who came to be known as Bohras. There are now approximately one million adherents in India and across parts of Eastern Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America.   
According to scholars, the sect today is largely comprised of traders, business owners and professionals. The Bohra world headquarters is in Mumbai where the Syedna, the religious head of this community resides.
The Bohra practice of FGM is very much alive and kicking today, and is ordained and supported by the current Syedna's decrees. The Syednas' support and sanction of the practice is enough to want all the Bohra women to observe it and perpetuate it unquestioningly and blindly.
 
Many Bohra women argue that this practice is part of the egalitarian nature of their religion, as both men and women are circumcised.
For men, the circumcision is done for health and hygiene, while for women, it is meant to curb sexual desire and tame them. The benefits of male circumcision apparently outweigh the risks - according to federal guidelines from US health officials released in December 2014, "There is scientific evidence that supports recommending the procedure". The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that medically-performed male circumcision could help decrease the risk of contracting HIV and several other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as other health problems.
The circumcision of men is a celebration in the community, while for the girl child it is a dreaded, secretive event done in the confines of the home without any proper instruments or medical supervision. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies. Immediate complications can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage (bleeding), tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue."
Jameela, an elderly matron, states matter of factly that, "Boys are circumcised at birth, and girls undergo the procedure at age seven, it's part of our religion." However, Zainub, a practicing doctor, acknowledges that "For males, the circumcision is for health reasons and that for women the procedure is to curb sexual desire and prevent wives from straying from their husbands." She also narrates a case of FGM gone horribly wrong because of the primitive methods causing excessive bleeding and a subsequent hospitalization of the girl child.
Young Bohra women continue to support the practice even though they may be ambiguous about the so-called benefits of the practice. Some elderly women call it "haram ni boti" which can lead young girls astray and say the process is needed to ensure they obey the wishes and commands of their husbands and don't lust for other men. FGM seems to be motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital virginity and marital fidelity.
Rashida, a childhood friend of mine, described the procedure as "Just a small snip of flesh done without anesthesia" and admitted to getting her daughter's circumcision done by a doctor in Dubai recently without really questioning the need for it.
Intellectually, some Bohra women accept that the rationale given for female circumcision of preserving the sanctity of marriage does not stand up to scrutiny, but they nonetheless accept it as part of the requirements of their faith that they share equally with men.
In December 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation. The resolution was passed unanimously and India was part of this unanimous decision. Several countries in the world have banned the practice of FGM. Nigeria is the latest country which recently passed a law banning FGM, taking the total of countries banning this practice to 23 in Africa alone.
Research shows that if practicing communities themselves decide to abandon FGM, the practice can be eliminated very rapidly. However, talking to women in my community shows this practice is perpetuated and even supported by some women among the Bohras.
Bohra women are among the most educated Muslims in India, they practice all kinds of professions from medicine, teaching to being businesswomen, artists, and research scholars, lawyers, journalists, making one wonder that why this educated section of women continue with this practice.
A large section of the women in the Bohra community genuinely believe the practice is religiously ordained and is good for them. Some blindly follow it as they are ordained to do it by the clergy. It is one of the many diktats which get followed without any questioning glare.
Another reason perhaps could lie in the complete indoctrination within the community to accept any and every decree of His Holiness, the Syedna, their religious head. The threat and fear of social boycott or excommunication for any form of protest or disobedience is so deep and so real that not many have the stomach of be booted out of the confines of the close-knit community. Any stepping out of line immediately attracts ostracism from near and dear ones, disallows you from participating in social and religious gatherings and meetings, prevents the marriage of your kids into the community, and prohibits your dead body from being buried in the community burial ground. This fear has prevented women from raising their voices against any oppressive practice.
A few years ago, Taslim (surname withheld) had started an online signature campaign on change.org to stop FGM among Bohras. The fear of the powerful clergy was so palpable that she refused to identify herself or come forward, even though her mind and heart were strong in their opposition to the practice. However, there are many like Taslim in the community who have read about the harmful effects of FGM on their little girls and refuse to subject their daughters to this barbaric practice. Taslim's parents had  taken a stand and had not got her circumcised. Taslim in turn did not allow her daughter to be circumcised, thus effectively breaking the chain of perpetuating the practice. There are many intelligent, questioning and enlightened Bohra men and women who have ensured this practice does not perpetuate. I have three sisters and we each have a daughter; we have not circumcised them.
The ritual of female circumcision does not have any religious sanction as such. If it did, why is it not practised uniformly across the Islamic world? The practice of FGM predates Islam, it is more cultural than religious. It is most widely practiced in Africa in all communities and religions (Muslims, Christians) and the practice of it among Bohras has something to do with their historical roots in Africa. In India, which has a large Muslim population, it is only the Bohras who practice FGM.
 
The way forward for us as Bohra women perhaps could be to break the vice-like grip of the secrecy around this practice. We need to talk about this practice and start questioning why is it done. We need to start voicing our experiences, our thoughts and our responses to this practice. Even if it is among family and friends. The secrecy and shame surrounding this practice should go. The practice is wholly voluntary. We need to openly acknowledge that something like this happens in our homes, in our families and in our lives, and that if we have to break the perpetuation cycle for the next generation, we have to start doing it first in our own homes. We owe it to ourselves and to our daughters.
All forms of female genital cutting must be seen to constitute a sexual mutilation and violation of bodily integrity. It amounts to a violation of human rights and child rights as it involves removing healthy, sensitive tissue from a non-consenting person, a girl child in this case. What happened to me years ago was an act of coercive violence without my consent, and I have chosen to speak out against it today and I sincerely hope others do so too.
PS: A trial has started in the Supreme Court of Australia in a case where where circumcision was found to be done on 2 girls belonging to a Dawoodi Bohra family in 2012. The girls mother, a senior clergy member Sheikh Shabbir Vaziri and a 68 year old nurse who performed the genital cutting on the girls, all these belonging to the Bohra community, are facing the trial. If convicted, the three accused could face seven years in jail as per the Australian law.
This case has begun to cause ripples in the Bohra community in India as well. Fear of the law and fear of arrest and a jail term can perhaps act as the best deterrent to abolish this practice.Masooma Ranalvi is a Dawoodi Bohra.

                            A truly detestable practice that has no place in any religion and must be stopped along with other such malpractices in the name of religion. I wonder why male circumcision is acceptable in todays society?

                            Bravo lady. You have taken a huge step by speaking up. So many customs and traditions IN ALL RELIGIONS are so ridiculous, dangerous and most of them are against women - and the worst part is that they are blindly practised without questioning and out of fear of being thrown out of the community. Which is pure rubbish. Its high time to stop torturing ourselves for nothing. If we all stand up and speak no one will be ostracised and things will be better. But it has to be ALL so that no one is targetted.

                            Look at the way things are in every community, but any practice which is part of Hindu community and especially Brahmin community is seen as a violation of human rights and to be condemned. In fact it is Brahmin community only which is most progressive and logical. I support ban on FGM not just in Bhora community by in any community.

                            You are brave and courageous to speak out and to have taken up a just cause in fighting against FGM. Keep up your commitment and you will gradually be joined by many others to put an end to this unacceptable social practice which continues to exist in many parts of the world, often undertaken secretly to avoid the law! What we need is a change in the mind set of parents to break away from this unnecessary and ugly practice that brings serious harm to innocent girl children and destroys their rights in womanhood. It is not FGM that will keep a woman from leaving her husband but the way in which husbands otherwise ill treat their wives in their day-to-day conjugal living.

                            Well the justification of male circumcision is bogus. It certainly reduces the chances of STD because of less friction and less chances of blood to blood contact. But this is applicable only for vagabonds who have too many partners. So if you visit pros then it makes sense to have your katna done else it is nothing but mutilation.

                            The practice of FGM should be banned altogether by the global community...  It is not a Islamic law and it is purely a cultural practice... The Sayednas should stop this as it violates basic human rights... The Bohra community men should wake up to stand against this inhuman culture.. The men who allow this practice should in fact be castereated to make them understand how it feels...

                            This is a barbaric practice that needs to be abolished quickly. In a male dominated society the aim is nothing but to deprive women of sexual pleasure and substitute it instead with pain. Abolish it now.

                            Dear readers, I would like and request you to do a small survey about health benefits of FGM before coming to a conclusion. A lil pain is always acceptable of a life time relief. Plz find the benefits of FGM below. It takes away excessive libido from women<br/><br/>
It prevents unpleasant odours which result from foul secretions beneath the prepuce.<br/><br/>
It reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections<br/><br/>
It reduces the incidence of infections of the reproductive system. <br/><br/>
In the book on Traditions that affect the health of women and children, which was published by the World Health Organization in 1979 it says: <br/><br/>
With regard to the type of female circumcision which involves removal of the prepuce of the clitoris, which is similar to male circumcision, no harmful health effects have been noted. <br/><br/>
And Allaah knows best.

                            What Bohra community practicing are against Islam,  they don't pray 5 times, they do whatever are forbidden in Islam. They taken the 100 old man as their Syadina(leader) and he is no more now. There is no relation between Islam and Bori muslim.

Hindus never ever did circumcision yet no disease in normal situation,it is about adopting hygienic habits to be practiced to prevent disease.

                            The writer of this article Ms.Masooma Ranalvi deserve a salute for being bold and fearless declaration of her suffering during her childhood.The misconception and adopting blind unreasonable practices of any religion is harmful to its own people.The hard core fact which is dangerously suppressed by the muslim community mainly by its religious heads who pre-dominantly males about treatment of women in their community.The importance of education for muslim women is very much needed in order to create a right kind of social balance of religious practice and protection of physical and moral values of women in the same community.The children are subjected to unwarranted physical and mental abuses under the false pretext of practicing religion.What we in civilized society term it as 'Blind faiths'.Every one is free to practice their own religion as people born in each and every religion not with their choices but know about it only after their births.Having born as child in this world it is duty of parents to protect their children against all kinds of wrong and unlawful practices including religion and from its blind values.Every human has right to live full life as a fit person both mentally and physically.No one has any right to deprive right of a child who is not at all aware of any consequences for their future lives.The child develop trust and love for their parents and grand parents and child follow them all the time.It is bad that grand parent or even parent misguide their own children and subject them to physical torture or mental torture.My thanks to writer again for explaining her experience with others in the same religion in order to protect their children and future generation from becoming victims of blind faiths.Good work.Pls keep it up.All the best to you Ms.Masooma Ranalvi.

                            Desires are not born with child. It is created by outside world. What is needed is that open free communication about Sex and Organs at the right age in families. I admire the balanced efforts in writing. We should stop pushing age old practices to the next generations.

                            If male circumcision is human rights violation as it's done without the consent of the child, is not cutting off the umbilical cord also a violation. What about being born without getting consent?<br/><br/>
Human mind has amazing capability to wander and it's always the odd opinions which gets most attention. It's the reason why few people are able to make our cities filled with stray dogs and dangerous for everyone.

                            Nobody has a right to take away that nature has given to you. It's a height of cruelty; FGM has to make a punishable offense by UN itself and should stop all the assistance to the countries those practice it. Instead of celebrating so many useless days, UN must concentrate seriously on the issue of human rights violation.
