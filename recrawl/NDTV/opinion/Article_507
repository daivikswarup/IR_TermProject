Headline::::My Sister Sania Mirza, World No. 1



DateTime::::2015-04-14T15:22:00+05:30



(Sania Mirza, 28, has become the first Indian woman to be crowned the world's top-ranked doubles tennis player. Her sister, Anam Mirza, 21, explains the journey to that mega-accomplishment.)
My first memory of Api was watching glimpses of her forehands while I climbed up a slide behind the tennis courts. Little did I know, one day my Api would be world-famous tennis player Sania Mirza.
Babba and mamma narrated to me a story a while ago - when Api was a child and they drove her around the country to play tournaments, people asked them extremely sarcastically if they were crazy, and if they thought they could make Api another Martina Hingis. Little did anyone know that was Api's plan. People were right, Api was crazy, crazy enough to think she was strong enough to change the world.
I don't remember a day in my 21 years when I haven't seen Api fall in love with tennis every day. There were days when mamma, Api and I woke up before sunrise. The two of us followed Api in a car, while she cycled all the way to the courts. There were weeks when my entire family drove through the country for tennis tournaments. There were months when I didn't see Api because she was playing tournaments in different countries. And there were years when the four of us worked on being a happy family while being on different continents.
My Api is super-human, she trains for six hours a day, she goes to the gym for two hours, she manages to fit in a family dinner and catching up with her friends. She travels to five different countries in three weeks, she doesn't get time to go sight-seeing, she manages to stay active on all forms of social media and she barely eats dessert. And this has been a constant routine for 21 years now.
I've seen her closely all my life, she's been the most disciplined person I know. She hardly ever gives up. She's the most determined person I know. She is passionate towards what she does. In the 21 years of my life, I've seen Api work to reach where she is today. All her teenage life, when her friends cared about looking pretty, she wasn't uncomfortable being tanned, she is the most self-confident person one can know. While her friends went for birthday parties, she chose going for practice. That is the thing about her, she did what she loved, and she loved tennis. And that is what it takes to make history.
She is not lucky to be the World Number One today. She has worked hard every day of her life. I've spent my life watching Api work and grow towards her dream. She knew it was hard, she knew it wouldn't be easy but she knew it wasn't impossible. Api has always been my World Number One, but today, she is everyone's.
Sania Mirza had finally turned one - it's been a 21-year-long journey.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            That's a lovely write up for your sister, Anam. Hard work does pay off and once you achieve a dream, there is no other feeling like it. Sania is an inspiration, whatever crap others may say.

Its her passion for tennis, determination and hard work, for last 21 years, gave her this well deserved pride. I am sure, her family has supported her whole hearted and this position will give them happiness and India is proud of her achievement

                            only if there was a nicer way to say this but Sania is NOT world no 1 ( if you take Martina Hingis out of the equation )....<br/><br/>
Martina Hingis spent a total of 209 weeks as world no. 1 already [1] She won five Grand Slam singles titles (three Australian Opens, one Wimbledon, and one US Open). She also won nine Grand Slam women's doubles titles, winning a calendar-year doubles Grand Slam in 1998, and two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, Sania is not even close to the above records &amp; if wasn't for Martina i don't think the pair would have won the title. So I guess let's keep this a low key....not much to be proud of !!!

                            It is all great! But I wish she continued her fight in singles rather than switching to a easier format - "Doubles". Truth is internationally people hardly care for "Doubles" player in Tennis. They are not even watched let alone people celebrating double rankings. In India it becomes a phenomenon!! We are a nation of overrated people! Look at Li-Na who created history. I will wait for the day to celebrate when India produces a grand slam winner. For now congrats to Sania Mirza for World No 1 in Doubles.

                            I must say that I've not been a big fan of Sania since I always thought she'd peaked a bit too early and could have achieved so much more had she displayed more maturity in her younger days. However reading this story by her sibling and knowing that what she has gone through to reach here has instilled respect for her. Very well written. Kudos!

                            Nice, cute little article by Sania's baby sister. Loved reading it.<br/><br/>
Sania has really worked very very hard not only on tennis but also against controversies - some of her own making; most of them unnecessary. I remember how we felt very hurt when she married a Pakistan cricketer. And most of us Indians are capable of saying nastiest of things when we feel let down by someone we love and adore the way Sania was and, fortunately, is again.<br/><br/>
Good luck Sania.

                            What ever your love for sister stands for , this achievement is so over rated . Press hardly mentions the word double as if she is the world champion in tennis . Doubles and mixed are just a celebratory affair as far as tennis is concerned . Her partners require equal credit , she wont be even win a game without her partners would she??? O what is this hype is all about. If she is an ace tennis player where does her singles ranking stands ?? So media please , Sania is just a over looked character , she is nowhere in sight where it actually matters and she is all basking in glory for herself where her partners should be given equal credit. <br/>
     Look the achievement of Saina Nehwal media hardly praises her but we know what she is , she is world No 1 in single even beating all the dreaded chinese players and others world over. As an Indian her achievement is much more to be celebrated than this hyper inflated gag.

                            Something is better than nothing, that's the adage I am reminded of, The fact is the tennis world really does not care about doubles, real tennis players play double to get warmed up before their single matches. Those who understand and follow tennis carefully understand this difference. I would rate her career high singles ranking of 27 much much higher than this in terms of professional accomplishment.

                            Tennis doubles reduces the game into a Table Tennis game(excluding serve)! If you have ever watched it, you would know! Only the serve possibly holding the game still as Tennis game!

                            When has doubles rating become so important in Tennis? Everyone knows Federer, Nadal, Djockvic be it an avid tennis follower or not. Does anyone know the Woodbridge brothers or Black brothers in tennis? Except for avid tennis followers i would not expect anyone else to know them. What I mean to say double tennis means nothing. I dont want to undermine the achievement of Sania. But this sensationalization of her doubles Nr.1 status is just another example of undeserving media hype. The truth is Sania Mirza had immense potential in womens singles had she been focused (note that she broke into top 30). Had it not been for her antics and media pampering she would have been known for her tennis than for her glamour quotient. She used injuries as an excuse for retiring from single. Actual truth is she never tried to be fit. Take example of Sharapova (who has much better glam quo) or william sister. Each time they battled career threatning injuries and came back hard. So my friend this so called achievement of Sania means nothing and is just media hype.

                            come on.. tennis is an individual sports.. sania prove your mettle like your fellow townie Saina that you can take the world on singles. You dropped it and partnered with other players to attain this.. so the credit equally goes to your partners. Then who actually cares about doubles? Prove it in singles if you have it in you....yours is just hyperinflated media gag.

                            She has achieved glorious glory.  Unfortunately it is in doubles, which is where top class tennis players may decide to retire to. I do not believe that the Indians have the killer instinct to win singles titles at the top level. That is where stamina, strength, focus and control over mind is truly tested. We are more at ease with "chalta hai". But for her it is no doubt brilliant.

                            It is a mere media hype and publicity stunt! Such hoopla are done to possibly uplift the image of the Sania Mirza so that she gets better bargaining power at promoting brands and also to become more recognizable face across the country. No doubt she deserves congratulations but the kind of articles are written about and media flashing that story for last few days shows how ignorant we are! Just step out of India to a Tennis playing country and ask who is Sania Mirza that will give you the real measure who Sania Mirza is. Double ranking in Tennis is not counted by public world over.

                            There is no doubt that Sania is the best women tennis player India has ever produced. We all know 50% of her fame is because of her looks. She is no where near to Susheel Kumar(2 olympic medals), Leandar or Saina Nehwal.  In Tennis we had players like Ramanathan and Vijay Amritraj and Ramesh Krishan who were in top 20 in singles and reached the quarters and semis of grandslams. NO body cares who is no 1 in doubles. All u fans can u tell who is the no doubles players in men's tennis .? Rest of the world also will scratch their head when we ask same question for women's doubles.

                            Sania deserves this place. Nobody can question that. But she is not Indian based on sub continent tradition. She is India passport holder, her husband is Pakistan passport holder so he is Pakistani. India does not allow dual citizenship. 2010 she married pakistani Shoaib Malik don't understand why still she is keeping Indian Passport. She should represent Pakistan not India. India can develop other women.
