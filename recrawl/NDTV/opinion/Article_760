Headline::::Power to The Youth



DateTime::::2015-08-14T13:47:00+05:30




                                For an entire decade now, the word "youth" has been the buzzword for our nation's policies and politics, but have we really managed to give them a voice where most needed? Often seen as having good potential as candidates, voters and election campaigners, there are certain areas where the youth needs this country's political class to hear them. 
A suppressed voice, an ignored voice of the young for the simplest reasons is what leads to harbouring the feeling of frustration, anti-establishment and hopelessness; that, in turn, leads to divides that have created crevasses in our country for long. 
Hearing those voices, reasoning with them, helping them meet their basics from the government is what will help us achieve path-breaking ideas, barrier-breaking progress. Progress, to start off with, may not be a leap of 10 steps, but let's take the first one, moving away from inertia and fear of decades. 
We have to take a multi-pronged approach to hearing the voice of the youth - Education Reforms at School and University, Grievance Redressal and a voice post-education. 
Education reforms are much needed today. For this, we may not only look at other countries, but also at some simple traditional methods of learning in our own past, like that of teaching mathematics. Education has seen a divide like none other, primarily because of the divide between urban-rural, between different examination boards, between the quality of teaching and school infrastructure. 
Even as we lay our focus on much-needed toilets for children and general overhaul of infrastructure, what we teach and learn must also be reviewed and revamped. Are we learning for the needs of our nation's future? Are we sustaining knowledge-based education, or are we encouraging rote learning?
After all, we are looking at our work force, leaders and professionals to come from this very system! 
At the school level, we must have a singular well-managed Board of Studies and Examination across the nation. We cannot have similar subjects being taught or understood differently in each different State of India. While regional languages taught in respective States till Class 8 is advisable, the basic syllabus and examination control must be common for subjects like History, Mathematics, Geography, Civics, Sciences, Economics etc. 
Similarly, at Universities, we must break from the stream system of Arts, Commerce and Science to a combination of subjects from any stream. Research and Development must also be encouraged at the University level, not keeping it limited to only scientific organizations. Curriculum for each subject like business studies, vocational courses may be designed for the next few decades, seeing the needs and changing dynamics of each field. Along with vocational courses for skill development, we must also look to hone the existing skills and passions for subjects taken as unconventional in India like music, film studies etc. Unconventional subjects today have a vast scope for creation of employment.
The question of unemployment today is because of the churning out of students with similar common degrees. We must move from degree-based education to knowledge and a talent-based education system. Whilst degrees qualify our knowledge, we must make sure that the qualification is based on the application of and excellence in knowledge. It is vital that we support the theme "passion must be profession." 
Another major issue is that of Grievance Redressal. The Grievance Redressal Cell, a part of every University, must be an important part of the HRD Ministry at the Centre and each Higher Education Ministry at the State level. It is imperative that it has a simple apparatus with a Minister Of State leading the charge. As a student, grievance redressal is a major issue for the smallest of problems at the University, right from re-evaluation of papers to spelling errors on the convocation certificate. However silly this may sound, this cell, if given importance, will vastly improve education, student life and education infrastructure. 
Issues like problems of exams and a lack of toilets on campus would be solved by getting the attention it deserves from the ministry. We cannot let the frustration of such small issues be enlarged due to red tape or lack of enthusiasm. Students are one of the largest sections of our society and will only increase. Their angst and frustration at being ignored are a major liability for a nation banking on its young population.
Along with Ease of Business in our country, we must also look at Ease of Education. 
Post education too, the youth deserve a voice and answers to their questions. At the ASSOCHAM meet in July 2013, addressed by Shri Rajnath Singh and Shri Uddhav Thackeray, I had proposed the National Youth Advisory Council. 
The council would work on a federal structure, fair and far from political interference. It may rotate every two years and not give immediate repetitive seats to members. To  avoid credit wars, the proponents and seconders of proposals may be kept secret; however, whatever be the doubts about such councils, we need to have the youth of today in positions to sit with the PM and Chief Ministers to understand the Government - its problems, its solutions, its way ahead and may be to propose a few solutions. 
Each council should consist of a cabinet-like intake on issues, picking youth from different fields of work - Education, Business, Aviation, Legal fraternity, Health and Fitness, Maritime, Finance, International Relations, Tourism, Hospitality, Agriculture and so on. 
The younger lot, the ones with the fire in their belly, always have some path-breaking ideas. It is not their fault that they tend to see things from a different perspective. We need to let them voice it. We have to channelize it positively. Their proposals might fail, falter, they aren't binding, but we need the youth to understand the issues faced by the Government and see it through a different lens. We need to gradually help them evolve from only being a part of the electoral process to the decision-making processes, if we are to see younger leaders. Who knows, one might just find a bright solution for some issue, some day!(Aditya Thackeray is the president of Yuva Sena, the youth wing of Shiv Sena)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            His father's party is in coaliation government and ruling the state and he was showing helpless by writing the blogs and giving youth a lame hope. If he is really interested in giving the youth of India to his place, he should come out and ask his government what is in your political dish for the youth ? if there is nothing he can dictate to include what he want to be ? otherwise you have your own time to run the government thereafter you didn't perform than you will be a good blogger only.

                            Across the nation, the truth that Shiv Sena is a party of bigotry must be imparted. It can not be different in different parts of the nation. Across the nation, youth must be told to reject the Sena's language of hate. That is what this offspring of the Thackerays, our today's messiah for youth and talent is saying

You guys have politicized topics like corruption, jobs, economy and youth involvement to confuse ordinary indians and remain in power. Shame on you and your party. So where are all the Shiv Shainik thugs today? Must br busy vandalizing some press or NGO offices. You go get back to your original work you are known for.

                            Very well written! Till date we've seen many politicians and so called youth leaders who made tall promises keeping the elections in mind but none of them made any efforts to fulfill those promises. I personally loved Uddhav ji's and your idea of digitizing the education sector. Also, your proposal of reviving the nightlife in Mumbai is a great one. If implemented, it would help in reducing the major problem of unemployment. Many youngsters can be employed if that proposal gets a nod.  More power to you! ☺

                            Our nation has been suffering all these years due to lack of patriotism and nationalism.Political Organisations,communal organisations,cultural organisation is not an all time solution.We lack an Indian citizen.Even the separatists and communal fenetics and anti-nationals shout day and night that they are the ones who protect secularism and democracy in our mother land.While these antinational elements condemn death sentence awarded to killers of thousands of our brothers and they seldom have a word to applaud the bravery of our soldiers who sacrificed their life for the nation.Those who represent 125crore people should unite to introduce a system to create a patriotic Indian citizen out of the misguided crores.Two years mandatory national service training under any of the 3 armed forced should be introduced to all Indian who complete 18yrs.All patriotic ruling and opposition members of Lower and upper houses of Parliament should in one voice pass legislation in this respect.It is a question of DO OR DIE.Any delay will be utilized by antinationals belonging to all ideologies and faith to destroy our great nation-the only model to the world for tolerance.

                            Man if you are talented, open a start up and do something good and provide people employment. Politics does not need you.

                            Power of the youth should be towards scientific development of nation - rather than hating deaf rumination on religions and regions of India.

                            Very minutely and perfectly analysed the scenario sir.! The transformation of degree based education to knowledge or talent based will be a necessity in coming years, also the syllabus should be uniform throughout so as to bridge gaps of knowledge of between university graduates.the syllabus of the present in any stream appears to be more basic and touches less the present research and inventions in the same.students just appear exams for the sake of clearing them, no interest or no inspiration just monotonous approach.Including projects and recent studies will help them get used to present scenarios in the industries nowadays.The point abt student grievance raised by you is the dire need of today, many problems are faced by student during their course tenure.we as youth believe you and hope you'll surely change the lives of our youth and strengthen the voices of ours.:)

                            Can a non-Thackeray be the leader of Yuva Sena or Shiv Sena ? There are millions of talented individuals in the country, who have fire in the belly and have path breaking ideas. Leave alone youth, even the veterans who had dedicated their life to Shiv Sena did not get opportunity to lead Shiv Sena. The day when India throws off dynastic families, pretending to be great visionaries, like Thackerays and the Gandhis and Yadavs and Scindias and Badals and others, and recognizes and elects true leaders - India will be on the path of progress. Please practise what you preach first !

                            Good article with all the right intentions. There are two problems. First how to translate these abstract ideas into actionable schemes. Second, to find the money to implement them. It takes some effort to turn dreams into reality. Even for the young idealist.

                            Another feku in making. Speak like a liberal but do nothing. Talking liberal of development provides a mask to all goons who are in fact spreading hate and violence between people - they did these many years and now they are doing it more effectively as have got a mask.

                            Every generation, when young, talks about youth power. Problem is that the idealism is lost once they go into adulthood.

You guys have politicized topics like corruption, jobs, economy and youth involvement to confuse ordinary indians and remain in power. Shame on you and your party. So where are all the Shiv Shainik thugs today? Must br busy vandalizing some press or NGO offices. You go get back to your original work you are known for.

                            Shiv Sena  proved as liability for balance of power in Maharastra. Very irresponsible party coming out with irrational statements at the wrong time. Actions always help Congress  as this Ss spoils Opposition interest trying to get eyeballs.  Very unorganized non ideological organization just like AAP and Kejriwal.

                            Very well written! Till date we've seen many politicians and so called youth leaders who made tall promises keeping the elections in mind but none of them made any efforts to fulfill those promises. I personally loved Uddhav ji's and your idea of digitizing the education sector. Also, your proposal of reviving the nightlife in Mumbai is a great one. If implemented, it would help in reducing the major problem of unemployment. Many youngsters can be employed if that proposal gets a nod.  More power to you! ☺

                            Our nation has been suffering all these years due to lack of patriotism and nationalism.Political Organisations,communal organisations,cultural organisation is not an all time solution.We lack an Indian citizen.Even the separatists and communal fenetics and anti-nationals shout day and night that they are the ones who protect secularism and democracy in our mother land.While these antinational elements condemn death sentence awarded to killers of thousands of our brothers and they seldom have a word to applaud the bravery of our soldiers who sacrificed their life for the nation.Those who represent 125crore people should unite to introduce a system to create a patriotic Indian citizen out of the misguided crores.Two years mandatory national service training under any of the 3 armed forced should be introduced to all Indian who complete 18yrs.All patriotic ruling and opposition members of Lower and upper houses of Parliament should in one voice pass legislation in this respect.It is a question of DO OR DIE.Any delay will be utilized by antinationals belonging to all ideologies and faith to destroy our great nation-the only model to the world for tolerance.

Live in Chawl for 10 years of your life, and survive on the money that you actually earned, then I will try to consider what you are saying...All dynasty politicians do not understand the common man.. A commom man should choose his own leader among themselves. End to dynasty politics!!! This is my view.
