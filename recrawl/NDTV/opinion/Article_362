Headline::::Movement Against Modi? Anna, Please Wait



DateTime::::2015-01-21T18:00:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)Is Anna Hazare upset with Narendra Modi? Is he planning to launch a movement against the Modi Government? Is he feeling betrayed by Kiran Bedi, his closest ally, for joining the BJP and running for Chief Minister of Delhi? Is he trying to regain his lost ground as a crusader against corruption? The answer to all these puzzling questions is a resounding "yes". Anna, the man who along with Arvind Kejriwal  changed the national discourse of the country by forefronting  corruption,  to has been feeling isolated by the winds of change which have engulfed the country for the last one year. He is lonely and tired but he wants to rise like a Phoenix.Anna, 77, has written four letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last seven months. He has raised the issue of black money and corruption in public life. Not one of his four letters has received a response. He is deeply disappointed and feeling humiliated. Now he has made up his mind. He is planning to write a fifth and final letter and will give the government a month's time to reply, and if the government again ignores him, then he will do what he knows the best that is, lead an agitation.He is apparently waiting for the Delhi elections to finish. As per information available, he will unveil his plans by the middle of the February, and the action will begin in the first or second week of March. It all depends on the response of the government to his final letter. He feels that the Modi government has not done enough for the people, specially on the issue of corruption. But his bigger disappointment is the desertion by his one-time loyalist and close confidante, Kiran Bedi. He had tremendous faith in her. It was with Kiran that he had decided to carve a path other than that of Arvind and his associates of India Against Corruption (IAC). When Arvind decided to form a political party and contest elections, Anna opposed the idea. He even declared that AAP could not use his name in its campaign for the Delhi election at the end of 2013. It's not that Anna did not know about Kiran's flirtation with the BJP leadership. Even during the Anna movement, once Kiran and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had given a proposal to Anna and his team that they should meet LK Advani and should sharpen their attack on the Manmohan Singh government and the Congress, while sparing the BJP and other parties. Some in the India Against Corruption agreed. But Arvind threw a fit and said the movement was not against only the  Congress, but against corruption of all the political parties.. Kiran was hugely disappointed. The first seed of discord between Arvind and Kiran was sown then which now has become a chasm.Anna undoubtedly has a soft corner for the BJP and the RSS linked to his past, but he loves to maintain his neutrality. He feels that Kiran Bedi joining the BJP has compromised his neutrality because of the the proximity Kiran enjoyed with him. After accepting the BJP's offer, she phoned Anna but he refused to receive her call. Anna believes that Kiran joined his group in 2011 to gain publicity and now that he is no longer in a position to offer her any section of the limelight, she has moved on. He said to a popular Marathi channel that "money and power mesmerizes people and very few people can remain unaffected." But today the question which needs to be asked is will Anna be able to garner the kind of support which made him a national phenomenon? No doubt the last few months have been disappointing for voters. The Modi government had promised the moon, but has failed to even provide cheaper power to Delhi. It has faced huge embarrassment on the issue of black money. Corruption is still unabated and there is no effort to curb it; honest officers are being removed from their posts. Price rise is still unchecked. But to say that Anna will again create the same old magic is too much to expect for two reasons:1. The Manmohan Singh government had lost all credibility due to the magnitude of corruption when the movement was launched in 2011. Modi has not delivered yet, his magic is waning, but a section of the society still wants to wait and wants to give him the benefit of the doubt. So it may be a tad early for Anna to launch the agitation.2. Let's not forget Anna was the face of the movement, but the real architect was Arvind Kejriwal. He was the planner and the strategician. It was a deadly combination. One had moral aura, the other was an action man. It worked beautifully.Such movements are not constructed in a day or a two. It is an amalgam of historical conditions, moral force and practical approach. We all respect Anna but he should not be in a hurry. The Modi government will provide enough opportunities to make itself unpopular.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            Ashutosh, man you have some imagination :-) When you guys will stop doing speculations. I believe you are not the official spokesperson of Mr Anna Hazare and believe me Mr Anna Hazare have lost of his credibility because of your boss Mr "IRunMan" Kejriwal. <br/>
By the way Ashutosh, you were a bad journalist and even a worse politician. I am a resident of Delhi and I am not a supported of Mr Modi or BJP but I am still amazed in the way Mr Modi led BJP government is working. We should have some appreciation for the opponents as well. Anyway it may be too much to ask from people like you who like themselves to be called as anarchist.

                            How do you know all this. It is because of pimps like you using media to influence people's opinion that media has lost all credibility. All this while you were taking salary from a company in which Ambani had invested and attended the meetings of IAC and then of AAP. The only unknown person among all of them was Kejriwal who has gained the most from the movement. Whom are you fooling now. You yourself are a parachute intruder in AAP and have the guts to accuse Kiran Bedi.

                            The people of this country feel cheated by you all civil society people, sometime we think you people had started the agitation to fulfill your personal aspiration to become rulers, all close aid of Anna/Ramdeo now a politician, sometime we also think all you people had not worked as an agent of BJP/RSS or are you all were poppet of BJP? because you people had made such strong wind against Congress/corruption and Modi/BJP at last moment came in picture and got the majority. Now Anna, Ramdeo and team silent on every issue including Black money/Job opportunity/development/price rise. Ask simple query: when Congress was on power then international crude oil price was $110 then in India Petro price was around Rs70/. now international price is below $50 then why price is around Rs 55/liter, whereas Petrol is decontrolled, it should be below Rs30 now. During Parliamentary election Modi ji used to tell ABCD, have he taken any action against ABCD till time, atleast he should take action against A-Adarsh, Maharashtra have his Govt ! Have you people listen TCS/IT sector layoffs going on, who should protect our job?Why Anna ji silent now !!

Writing such article in name on Anna ji and trying to prove a ridiculous point that Modi government is complete disappointment. Such a shame. Let Anna ji be the voice for his believes and stop using others for such cheap publicity.

                            Why is AAP and this guy shooting on Anna's shoulder? Because, they lack credibility. When they had golden chance of governing Delhi, they ran around like a headless chicken and now, they talk as if they know everything about governing. First, these guys need to learn to accommodate everyone with divergent views and remove the humble facade behind which they have a magnanimous arrogance.

                            What a logic..?<br/><br/>
- If AK joins politics, it is not betrayed but KB joins politics, it is betrayed to Anna.<br/><br/>
- So Anna updates everything to AK &amp; his party about all his actions..! Four letters and fifth one in Feb, possible agitation, etc...! Who would believe this as both Anna &amp; AK fought for money received during IAC moment.<br/><br/>
- With time, just like AK, Anna too has lots public faith. No one believed his campaign to support Mamta during LS 2014. Both AK &amp; Anna did some kind of dharna after 2010 but no one succeeded. <br/><br/>
- Why AAP so scared by KB's decision of fighting election. Till now, AK wanted to offer her CM chair? So why now oppose? By joining AAP, does she would have not join politics? By then, Anna was suppose to happy? <br/><br/>
And now AAP talks about Anna's unhappiness but creation of AAP was itself unhappiness of Anna. As he never wanted to convert his andolan into politics. AK use Anna to enter in politics.<br/><br/>
So Ashutosh Maharaj, instead of worrying about KB, focus on campaign. Everyone here comes to read comment section only, hardly anyone would reads your article fully.

                            Good Lord. This guy Ashutosh really goes to extremes to trot out rubbish. <br/><br/>
He is trying to make it as if Mr. Kejriwal is the only person authorised by God to fight corruption.<br/><br/>
He is trying to make use of the published 'rift' with Ms Bedi to make news and run down people for no reason. <br/><br/>
Anna can agitate if the govt is seen as corrupt but it would make no sense now to start an agitation without any valid cause.<br/><br/>
All that AAP seems to do is to rant and rave at other parties without ever coming up with any constructive point

THe task of managing this country and bring it back to some order and rid it of corruption in a democracy may take many years. May be a dictator can achieve the magic in a year or two. Your imagination working on overdrive during election season.

The way to cleanse a system is to join it and clean it from inside...You guys had your chance, but lost the plot seriously.<br/>
AK is now critizising KB daily now - like a hawk.. ah she touched a statue, ah she is not debating .. You guys need to grow up and be more mature. If Anna wants to start a movement, tell me one good reason why he should wait for the Delhi Elections to start. He can be more effective if he asks the BJP govt to act NOW before the Delhi elections, right?

Same guy told many things about Anna now turning his stance and portraying Anna And Arvind are the architects of movement. It is we the people who supported IAC are the real architects. The problem with AAP guys is they are opportunistic people. They criticised sheila and gone with congress then got divorced with congress before honeymoon period for any govt. They know only barking vtout substance. Till now no single evidences in any cases they showed to "AAM AADMI" not AAP. They are following same principles like other parties do. So dont trust these guys too.

                            This article is a provocation to Anna for an agitation and followed by anarchy by AAP... coz face it.. Kejri is the real architect of Apna Anarchy Party. He was the planner and the strategician. It works beautifully!

                            It is your figment of imagination that Anna is more upset with Kiran than he is with Arvind (even if you dont suggest it directly). Anna is a grown up man and can say and write for himself. The last person we would want to hear about Anna's thoughts is from AAP. <br/>
Its shameful of AAP that they have started re-using Anna for your electoral purposes.<br/>
You guys are losing all the remaining goodwill you had. excuse me for being very clear.

                            Since When has Ashutosh become the spokesperson for Anna's thoughts. This looks speculative/ absurd as usual.<br/>
If you take para 7 nd replce the words Kiran with Arvind and BJP with AAP, looks like the same thing could have been said about Kejriwal in the context of 2012-2013 when AAP was started. So, do you think that was the reason that Arvind broke off with Anna? So, How cn this be attributed to another induvidual from same group? Double Standards?

                            Just in the name of Corruption Removal - AnnA's movement erased complete credibility of UPA Govt. BJP/Modi seized the moment and won the nation. Arvind formed Party and got the Alternative Party Recognition. Later Bedi, Ilmi, Vipin etc etc seized the opportunity and joined BJP's wagon. Every politician gained in this movement, except AnnA &amp; Common man, with no change in corruption or black money repossession.

                            I loved it! Your story has drama, suspense, betrayal, anecdotes, hope. Looks like off late you have been breaking bread with some story teller. Quite a story, Ashutosh. Are you planning to crossover to Indian film industry - perhaps calling this one as another awakening. From Journo to almost politician to an aspiring story teller. Krantikari, should be a good name for your story!

                            It is O.K for people to assess the performance of a government based on their expectations, perception, available information etc. But to talk about an agitation against a newly elected government without giving it sufficient time to prove or disprove itself can only be expected from anarchists.

                            Dear Mr. Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
I have become tired of your commentary about lowering the power rates and solving the water problem in Delhi. You were there for 49 days and did not want to carry the burden of presenting and managing an annual budget which every responsible management does. Do you know what percentage of power is stolen in Delhi? If you just eliminate that by 50%, you will have to do nothing else and you will not be digging a hole in the budget bucket. I am astonished that someone coming from revenue service does not understand the basics of revenue management! Did you put a long term policy for alternative energy or any other form for energy augmentation? On water availability and tariff reduction, how do you address the demand and supply equation? Water is not produced in a factory!<br/><br/>
My angst about you is that you will find another institution to blame and go sit on dharnas again since you neither seem to understand basic governance nor collaboration to achieve objectives. My way or highway approach does not work except in autocracies.<br/><br/>
Your wishes are noble but define ways to achieve things in real life. Till then, it will be a fool's paradise you live in and continue to show others. And i deeply regret saying that because you look like a bunch of well meaning people.

if they lose in delhi which looks certain then they will instigate anna again with kejriwal falling at anna's feet to ask for forgiveness and start agitation all over again with kejriwal ... but this time their agitation / dharnas / dramas will fail as people have seen real face kejriwal crusade against corruption... it is not against corruption but against BJP / Modiji and also to get power and make lots of money by whatever means it takes including taking money / support  from ford foundations / anti-indian organizations with promise to them of causing disturbance in india...

As far as i know for the greed of power u resigned from some job and grabbed MP ticket on arrival. Was that fair to others? Just compare ur n ur guru kejri's contribution to the country and then put allegations on others.

Either he has some good amount stashed in his banks or is he relying on the public to support his life? I simply wonder how...I respect him and all...but what is his income source?

                            The fact that the movement has been made defunct by the very stalwarts who had stood as backbone of the movement but the fight against corruption has fallen victim to corruption of intentions and self interest. Modi, as his record exhibits is a pro-rich capitalist who is possibly as corrupt as anybody else an besides having nurtured an narrow parochial hinduvta philosophy to the detriment India's secular credentials. Even Anna might not be able stop the march of these divisive corrupt forces supported by vested large businesses. Environment, Lok Pal, Land reform, Communal harmony, crime against woman, health care, education- one by one is compromised with the promise(???) of development. India should stand up before the carrot of development never materializes except a few mega projects and at the cost of national character.

                            Ashutosh Ji, I marvel at your analysis of the AnnaJi's movement and actions. I agree with you that he should not do any thing in a hurry and wait and watch for the right opportunity, which will in plenty in the coming months.I sincerely hope and expect that the voters in the well preserved constituency of Mr Harshwardhan prove that they are different from those in Karnal where they hauled Mr Khattar and made him CM. Even BJP knows that Kiran Bedi is no Khattar. She is an highly ambitious turncoat.She can go to any length to gain power and position. If she can ditch a sincere,saintly person like Anna Ji then any thing is expected from her. I appeal to the loyalists of Harshwardhan to make the imported cop to lick the dust and watch her running away from the BJP.
