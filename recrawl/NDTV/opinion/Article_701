Headline::::Pak Talks Need More Than Modi's Event Management



DateTime::::2015-07-13T13:26:00+05:30




                                Any engagement is preferable to no engagement. And, therefore, one cannot but welcome the decision taken at Ufa to arrange a meeting in New Delhi in the near future between the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan. 
 
But please note that, at the moment, only ONE meeting has been agreed upon. As with everything Modi does, he is organizing an event, not a process. When the India-China talks on the border were agreed upon, the Indian NSA and the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs met as "special envoys", not for a one-off event but to commence a process whose end could not be foreseen. 18 rounds of talks later, the end can still not be foreseen, but what we do have is (relative) peace and tranquility on the India-China border, reinforced by a structured uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue that has kept us at arm's length or more from war. It is a process, not an event.
 
The dialogue between the Indian and Pakistani NSAs might yet - Inshallah! - evolve into a process. But before we start celebrating Ufa as a "blockbuster" - which at least one pink paper has seen fit to emblazon in its lead headline - let us note also that meetings between the two DGMOs, (Director General Military Operations) scheduled at Ufa, are not anything new. Indeed, they had been written into Dr. Manmohan Singh's peace process but disrupted since, in consequence of which the DGMOs have not met after their last encounter in December 2013 under the UPA government. The disruption in DGMO meetings was caused by the onset of the Modi government. Is the old process of regular meetings of DGMOs to be resumed - or is the Ufa decision yet another instance of event management? 
 
Similarly, annual meetings between the Directors-General of the Indian Border Security Force and the Pakistan Rangers have been a key feature of confidence-building between the two countries for years. All that has been agreed upon at Ufa is that they will meet again - but this too has been hyped up as some kind of extraordinary innovation. 
 
All right-thinking people will greatly welcome the agreement to release all fishermen and boats captured by either side. But what happens from now on? Will fishermen and boats be no longer captured? Will those captured be promptly released? What, in terms of stability in relations involving poor fishermen, has Ufa achieved? Have the two countries been served a half-baked cake?
 
There is also ambiguity over the "voice recordings". Does this mean we accept the Pakistani contention that the evidence presented earlier is inadequate? Or have we decided to play along to get the Pakistanis to get serious about the trial? Meanwhile, Lakhvi is out on bail - and out of sight. Will not a 26/11 trial without Lakhvi physically in the dock tantamount to Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark? Or the Mahabharata without Shakuni?
 
It is also curious that while the NSAs are to meet, Ufa does not seem to have addressed itself to the 2006 Joint Terror Mechanism announced at Havana by Manmohan and Musharraf. Can a single meeting between the two NSAs substitute for institutional arrangements to deal with terrorism, which is a threat to both, but has the unique dimension of also being targeted from Pakistani soil to India - and, according to Pakistan, from India to Pakistan, particularly in Baluchistan? One supposes that all this will be on the agenda when the veteran Sartaj Aziz of Pakistan meets Ajit Doval of India. But, in the absence of an assurance to the contrary, will they meet again? Once more the question - is this an event or a process?  
The question is germane because back in 2006, nearly a decade ago, the NSAs were to regularly meet as a means of invoking or monitoring the Joint Terrorism Mechanism. But if JTM is no longer on the cards, and Ufa says nothing about a process of NSA encounters, what exactly is envisaged in terms of substance?
 
There is another worrying aspect of the Ufa outcome. As NSAs, the two sides are narrowly - if appropriately - focused on issues of national security. But the composite dialogue has a much wider ambit, which is why it was (is?) coordinated by the two Foreign Secretaries. Now, Sartaj Aziz is not only NSA, he is also effectively the Foreign Minister. The entire panoply of India-Pakistan relations is, therefore, within his purview. It is not within Doval's. Moreover, as a senior statesman with Cabinet rank, Sartaj outranks Doval. So, our representative will be labouring under a double handicap. I have known Doval for years and am aware of his personal abilities (which are formidable), but diplomacy depends as much on institutional factors as it does on personalities. My own suggestion, for what it is worth (which is not very much), is that if their first encounter leads to an institutionalization of the dialogue process, they should be designated "special envoys" with Cabinet rank of their respective Prime Ministers so that they come on an equal footing, and are enabled to understand "national security" in its broadest sense instead of being narrowly confined to guns, nuclear bombs and mutual spookery.
 
All the signs point to Ufa as a step forward but hardly a breakthrough. That requires a change of heart - particularly on the part of Narendra Modi. The change of heart required is a total breakaway from the communal prejudices of his RSS past. Is it too late for the leopard to change his spots or the tiger its stripes? Perhaps. But a truly secular spirit is essential to work out a settlement with Pakistan - a secularism that is stronger than the sectarian baggage that any Pakistani brings to the negotiating table. 
 
Second, and at least as important, is strategy. What is the long-term aim beyond giving news value to the Ufa meeting? So far, all we have had on Pakistan from the Modi government is stop-start with a lot of grinding of teeth, posturing and bullying, not any long-term delineation of aims and objectives, no projection of a long-term vision. One asserts this in the light of the incontrovertible evidence of the swearing-in transforming into a swearing-at within months of what was believed to be a break-out from the trough.
In May 2014, there appeared to be a clear decision to resume the stalled composite dialogue. Yet, on the very eve of the Foreign Secretaries' talks, a new 'red line' was drawn by the Modi government. This was the stern warning to Pakistan that if the High Commissioner interacted with the Hurriyat, as Pakistani dignitaries had been doing for 15 years (with neither profit to themselves nor harm to us, just some window-dressing) the talks would be called off. Pakistan cocked its snook at Modi - and the talks were called off. We are still stuck in that impasse - for Ufa said nothing about J&K, not even about whether talking to the Hurriyat would once again result in talks being called off.
 
In sum, some answers were found at Ufa but the unanswered questions are more numerous. A true breakthrough needs a joint commitment to "uninterrupted and uninterruptible" dialogue, without which we will both continue to buck and lurch like a drunken ship as we have been doing these past many years. (Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            MSA mentions dialogue with China. In the past few years, how many times Chinese PLA crossed the border and entered into Indian territory and claimed Indian Territory as theirs? Can MSA give a count? In the 10 Years of UPA rule, can MSA give an account of accomplishments when it comes to the relationship with Pakistan? Can MSA give account of UPA's accomplishment in curbing cross border terrorism? Can MSA give account of progress made in 26/11 Terrorist attack cases during UPA rule? All the things UPA did not do, are being pursued now. There may not be progress or even any result, but at least the current Government is trying and sharing with the people what they are trying to do. Mr. MSA, if you cannot support it (for obvious reasons), then please stay back and watch. Do not write articles and make a fool of yourself further.

No one is perfect neither you nor any other party. If opposition thinks they were so smart then why were we unable to do anything for long . Just writing articles and praising bosses doesn't work. You are a educated and sane person, think logically , think what is better for country &amp; society . I hate to say that we for next 60 years won't move a inch forward . Its in our DNA to pull someone back if someone even tries to do something good. I rest my point

                            For 55 out of 67 years Congress governed India and obviously one of the things they did was to put into process, as Mani himself says, to talk to Pakistan &amp; try &amp; have a peaceful neighbourhood. What results have we seen after 55 years of a very good, intellectual, secular process? <br/><br/>
Mess of 55 years cannot be cleaned in 1 year. There is a process to clean up the mess created by Congress Mr.Aiyar. After creating all the problems, congress is advising the new govt that their process is still better!

                            Useful Idiots" is a pejorative term that was used by the Soviets to describe Soviet sympathizers in Western countries and in the United States in particular.  It is thought that the Soviet leader Lenin was the first to use the term and it was used by the Soviets for many years to ridicule misguided Americans who were willing to take the Soviet/Marxist side against their own country.  Some say that today the term "useful idiots" can be used to  describe those who support a malignant cause which they naively believe to be a force for good.  Mani is at best an "useful idiot" or at worst has been compromised in some way by the Pakistani intelligence/security establishment.<br/>
Mani Shankar Aiyer fits the description of an "useful idiot" from the Pakistani point of view. Mani would like us to believe/or is trying to hoodwink us into believing that the it is the "process"  reinforced by a structured uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue that has kept us at arm's length or more from war with the Chinese. Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact it is to wisdom, and reasonableness of the  leaderships of both these countries and the lessons LEARNT from the 1962 war by us Indians (we have strengthened our armed forces) that has prevented a major war from breaking out or developing from the sudden/accidental skirmishes that take place on the Indo-China border. With Pakistan, the skirmishes or provocations are not accidental but are part of a deliberate dark strategy planned and implemented by the Pakistani/security establishment. It is a deliberate policy to keep the Kashmir issue alive and on the front pages of newspapers. A deliberate strategy by the Pakistani establishment to blackmail the world that if the "Kashmir issue" is not resolved to Pakistan's liking, the unthinkable will happen  - a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan The Pakistani security establishment are answerable to no one, not to the people of Pakistan or the civilian political establishment. Its praetorian instincts stems from the "jihadi" mindset that is prevalent among its officer corps who see themselves as inheritors of the legacy of "Muslim rule" in the Indian subcontinent, Muslim domination or superiority over the "weaker - vegetarian Hindus," in their warped minds, being the natural order of things. They will not rest until they are able to pry Kashmir from India by hook or by crook. - but to their dismay and lessons learnt from four military defeats, they have come to understand that India has a vice like grip on Kashmir and no force on earth is going to change that. <br/>
The crooked method adopted by the Pakistani security/intelligence establishment wolf is to don sheep's clothing. They are now all for "peace." A false peace, to hoodwink the people of India, wherein Pakistan is able to infiltrate Kashmir, weaken India's armed forces grip on Kashmir and then  with the help of the rising superpower China gobble Kashmir once and for all. So we now have the "TRACK II TALKS" - a supposedly informal group that is supposed to push, goad, persuade and convince both sides to a durable, lasting and prosperous future. The Pakistani side is made of former ISI generals, army generals etc.  And the Indian side is headed by Mani Shankar Aiyer!!!! Make no mistake -the only goal of the Pakistanis is to first weaken India's hold on Kashmir and then grab it! It is the Pakistani's security/intelligence establishment that wants to have structured uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue, so that they can bargain with India, manipulate us Indians emotionally to make us  withdraw our armed forces from Kashmir. It is they who initiate the sudden, unexplainable, artillery firing, skirmishes along the Indo-Pakistan border/LOC because they want us to believe that dark forces in Pakistan want to scupper the "peace talks" and therefore we Indians better keep talking, hurry up and be more flexible, shouldn't be so rigid, as a big brother we must be more forthcoming and more charitable and generous into giving them everything they want - our poor lost Pakistani younger brothers! I once heard Mani saying on a TV debate show that we should not deal with the Pakistanis with clear headed cold, hard thinking but we should deal with them emotionally -as our poor lost Pakistani brothers! Exactly what the Pakistani security/intelligence establishment wants!!!

                            This Moron is at it again.  Like Pakistan, he will never change. I think both of them require a nuclear treatment.

                            Can anybody explain why we need to talk to Pakistan ? We have tried talks and it has failed as Pakistan is not interested in peace, only in terrorism. We should focus on our economic growth &amp; ignore Pakistan. Pakistan needs India while India can afford to ignore Pakistan.
