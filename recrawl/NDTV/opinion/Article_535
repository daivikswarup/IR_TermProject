Headline::::Barkha Dutt On The Women's Safety Remarks That Went Viral



DateTime::::2015-05-01T00:18:00+05:30




                                In an age when the answer to the question "Are you a feminist?" mostly evokes a standard disclaimer "Yes, but...", I am an unapologetic Feminist and I embrace that self-description without any qualifications.
I was excited to be a speaker at Tina Brown's 'Women in the World Summit' in New York because it gave me the opportunity to meet some truly wonderful, brave and accomplished women. From Saida Munye, a Swedish mother who went all alone to the Syrian border to look for her daughter who had run away to join the ISIS, to Meryl Streep's take on why Hollywood is still seen through the 'male gaze', I enjoyed being part of a genuinely global conversation on gender.
On one of the panels, film-maker Leslee Udwin (whose documentary 'India's Daughter' on the Delhi gang-rape is presently banned here by a court order) and I were interviewed by American TV host Norah O'Donnell. The conversation focused not just on Udwin's film, but also on how and why gender has moved into the mainstream of public debate in India after the horrific gang rape of a young woman in Delhi more than two years ago. I made it clear that I did not support the ban and thought it to be a knee-jerk, ill-conceived decision. My attempt was to go beyond the debate around the ban, and explain to an audience largely unfamiliar with India, that as horrific as the incidents of sexual violence are in India, the noise you hear is also a moment of hope -  the noise is, in fact, because men and women, all of us, are speaking up and shouting when we need to.
In a changing India, gender finally does not exist only on the margins of public and political attention. It is now center-stage and we are demanding accountability and justice for all.  
 
I returned to India to find that the video had gone viral this week. It has been among the trending topics on Facebook for the last two days and appears to have generated a huge online debate. I have been deluged by feedback and have been overwhelmed by how many people have written in. The comments that have attracted the most attention have been my disagreement with the moderator when she said she felt too unsafe to travel to India and told me that after watching the film, she saw India as the rape capital of the world. I expressed my strong disagreement with the simplistic and somewhat condescending caricature, challenged her on the statistical inaccuracy of her perception, and also pointed to the many continuing gender inequities within the US, not least among them rape on campus, the absence of paid maternity leave, the continuing furore over women's reproductive rights and the glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton is still battling to smash in a country that has never had a woman President.  
I said that while I accepted there were many problems and challenges we are battling in India - the refusal by our law-makers to recognise marital rape and the molestation and murder of a young woman pushed off a bus in Punjab are the most recent flashpoints - I believe every country is struggling with entrenched misogyny in varied ways. The gender debate, in effect, is a global one.
I also argued that the asymmetry of power in the global discourse around gender influenced how Indians had perceived and received Ms Udwin's film and subsequent generalised comments about the country. Could I, I asked my American Audience, have the space to come to Ferguson and make the definitive film on race?    
I see no contradiction in being a passionate feminist and advocate for equal rights and justice for all women, and in also calling out a stereotype and caricature about India. We had a lively, civilized, feisty debate that gave us all much food for thought. That the panel has generated a furious debate is satisfying. It speaks once again to why I see this as an inflection point in India for the gender conversation. We all care. Even if we don't always agree.

                            Women are just not safe in India. Period. I live in the US and have lived in the UK and being an Indian I have lived in India a long time. India doesn't make me feel safe at all!! False pride of patriotism doesn't change facts. We like to make grandiose statements but living in India is like living in hell. We might have had a woman PM but not the likes of a Thatcher or a Merkel. It's the woman PM who has given rise to a dynasty rule, so please don't feel proud about it.US and UK have social security, what do Indians have? If being so progressive, why doesn't the indian population understand that more children would be a burden to the country and resources. Sorry we have not even reached close to what western countries achieved 60 years ago.

                            Really appreciate the response from Barkha, esp. voicing her opinion with utmost confidence in an international forum. There are things to improve in our country with regards to gender discrimination etc, but at the same time it isn't as bad as it is projected in the media.

                            The film really muddied the waters and confused the viewers as its message was not clear. There have been thousands and thousands of rapists in this world, and what goes on in their minds is a matter for psychological study by academics not for journalists or film makers. Having seen the film on BBC and YouTube, if the mentality of this rapist was exposed to lay people, I totally missed it! IMHO this film had other agendas including that of smearing India with a broad brush as the rape capital of the world. The banning of the film was correct, to show westerners that they will not be given the liberty to rape India, as they had done for 200 years in the past.

                            Excellent articulation at by @bdutt. Hats off! But damage to India's reputation by Udwin's film is already done. Its too late to defend now. Moderator herself told @bdutt that after watching Udwin's film she saw India as rape capital and found India unsafe to travel. Millions have watched the film. Only few thousands abroad may have watched @bdutt's defence. Damage is already done! I wonder why our media didn't debate this angle - India's reputation - while going berserk to promote Udwin's film. No one even critiqued d film. Every channel was so keen to 'take up the cause' without realising the film is going to damage India's reputation badly. Even BBC played mischief by not showing world statistics in film and our media was trying to be idealistic &amp; supporting Udwin. Udwin has betrayed India.

                            In the last 10 years of my life i have lived for 5 years in India and 5 years in USA. While there is no doubt the satus of women is improving in India i disagree on a lot or most of her rebuttal.<br/>
One particular comment that stands out in the comment she made was "more per capita sexual assaults happen in USA than India"<br/><br/>
The fact of the matter is lots and lots of rapes in India go unreported forget sexual assaults.<br/>
And in the USA if a man even touches or pinches a woman in the back it is reported as sexual assault and treated seriously. I am sure there are uunreported cases in the USA too but the percentage is way lower.<br/><br/>
Also enforcement and prosecution/conviction percentages and timely justice is way faster in USA.<br/><br/>
Heck the court/govt recently said that there cannot be rape in a marriage. What nonsense. any forced sexual interaction is rape dosent matter who does it.<br/><br/>
To conclude while India is getting safer for women, it is still very dangerous and the rate of improvement is not good enough<br/>
So to conclude while the condition of women is improving

every thing started had good reasons for a balanced society.<br/><br/>
example ban bad movies / documentary which does not carry any meaning other than creating violence and disturbance in society .<br/><br/>
Ban animal killing , after all they too have the right to stay in this earth , unless and untill we respect them we can't have a balanced eco system. Natural calamities are the result of curse of these innocent animals who gets killed.

                            At last NDTV spoke out against these haughty western media. Currently, India as a society is a boiling pot. Some day in future it will cool down, I hope. But, one thing is precisely clear, these western media folks, don't give a damn to Indian women, nor Indian women safety. Their interest lies in only leveraging Indian women safety issue to shame an entire India, while burying their internal racial and gender issues. E.g., CNN and BBC carried in great length how the UVA campus rape case was an hoax, made-up and blamed the the reporter and the victim girl for cooking up the story.

The sentences that made you viral could have been used differently and more responsibly to address the issues. Here's hoping there is a next time for you to do yourself better on gender issues...

                            Big thumbs up to Barkha, Nonetheless it is the media whose contributions has led to this social revolution for much needed light on sexual violence. For whatever reasons media creates public opinion. In the light of  which, such a mass revolution has been carried on to make indias women safer. Following up on this media has done a great job by constantly focussing on news on rape and violence against women. This has kept the spirit alive and certainly will change public perceptions to grant freedom to women to go arround safely without thinking what they are wearing, at what time they are out etc etc. <br/><br/>
The downside of all this is India as a nation is potrayed as the place where women are raped, On an entireity this is questionable. Adding to which the film from  Leslee Udwin who uses this to create awareness for a global cause, which is again great work. But, this creates worse perceptions for the nation globally, whose media and society is already trying to do self correction. Modi regime is a regime which does think negative publicity created like this will compromise not only the positive environment in the minds of the people but also the effort to come out of poverty through industrialization by forein investments. Thats the reason for all the knee jerk reaction to ban the movie, but the cause has already been taken up by people like barkha and media.<br/><br/>
Opposing the ban is a good stand, but we Indians know it all, dont we? We know why govt is banning, offcourse it is not opposing a social cause, but the image which is crutial. And media opposing the ban is the right thing to do. There are already visible signs of equations being build up in the world as India=place where rape takes place, That is for the people not actually knowing much about it. So Barkha has put light on the matter very well, And whether she made money by commenting or not is absurd but as a daughter of the country did what was right and corrected the genaralizing way of putting india as unsafe by the anchor.

                            I am in total agreement of Barkha here too, as I most often am. Being an unapologetic feminist and supporter of rights of all people suppresses, I see no contradiction in both positions either.<br/><br/>
I am so proud of her that she did what she did in that debate. I often narrate the misogyny of Indian men and women (her in the UK), and encourage debate on rights of women back home. But I have begun to take care to mention that either misogyny or suppression of women and their rights id not unique to India. Its just that we have chosen to be aware of existence of the problem and talk about it as a means to deal with it and many other countries, in their pride of superiority are not ready to do the same. Here also out culture of argument and debate is what is going to save us and march ahead.<br/><br/>
Once again proud of you Barkha Dutt. Your contribution to the cause of women of India will go down in history with golden letter.

The statisticians who understand the reality behind India's statistical excellence must be turning in their grave.

                            A cheap image building exercise. The entire country knows how much this woman hates her own country and loves Pakistan.

                            you say your debate has gone viral,  there is a  big market for  foolish audience. You and NDTV certainly think so. Keep praising your own tail/tale

                            US will make a feature film on such incident showing one of the very rare psychic in their very civilised society. They earn lot of dollars from global market. In our case it would a documentary made by white skinned western intellectual to show all indians think like that repost - it is not one of rare case. Very common in India.

                            Women are just not safe in India. Period. I live in the US and have lived in the UK and being an Indian I have lived in India a long time. India doesn't make me feel safe at all!! False pride of patriotism doesn't change facts. We like to make grandiose statements but living in India is like living in hell. We might have had a woman PM but not the likes of a Thatcher or a Merkel. It's the woman PM who has given rise to a dynasty rule, so please don't feel proud about it.US and UK have social security, what do Indians have? If being so progressive, why doesn't the indian population understand that more children would be a burden to the country and resources. Sorry we have not even reached close to what western countries achieved 60 years ago.

                            Power is power. Today it is predominately in the hands of the male. But it can be devastating in the hands of a female just as much. It is about equalising power and not gender

                            Excellent job Barkha. Nice pointing on double standard of WEST on Generalising India and not introspecting themselves on core issues, BBC 's avoiding statstical data in film. Keep it up.

                            Appreciate your comments made at the said event. But disagree on the topic of marital rape. I hope you analyze the issue from a practical and men's point of view as well.

                            Your sincere effort to put the situation in India in the right perspective is really commendable. However I feel that Leslie tried to interrupt / speak over whenever you tried to point any flaw in her film/ narrative. And maybe your point of view did not come out as clearly as it should have
