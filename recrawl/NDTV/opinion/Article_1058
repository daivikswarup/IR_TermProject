Headline::::Why Kanhaiya Kumar's Speech Is International News



DateTime::::2016-03-04T21:18:00+05:30




                                Student politics doesn't have the most enticing of reputations - not just in India, but more or less everywhere. It's often a mix of idealism and shrill inexperience, with the decibel level drowning out everything else.
So when a student political leader is streamed live on TV across the nation for fully three-quarters-of-an-hour, and trends on social media not just in India but well beyond, then you know something remarkable is stirring.
"Can't remember the last time a speech by a youth leader (or a communist!) got so much attention" - tweeted TV anchor Vikram Chandra.
Neither can I!
"Cometh the hour, cometh the man," the old adage goes. And Kanhaiya Kumar has certainly lived up to the moment.
Of course, the newly-bailed JNU student leader had a lot going for him. A freshly-minted hero returning to his home patch with an elated and enthusiastic late night audience, and thanks to events of the last couple of weeks, with the sort of name recognition that even some cabinet ministers can only dream about.
It was, of course, a victory speech, delivered with just a touch of swagger. Much of India may have been astonished about the way in which the JNU controversy has rolled out - for much of the world, this has fed a narrative about an increasingly illiberal and intolerant strain within India's public life.
But Kanhaiya Kumar's oratory was remarkable - spell-binding, warm-hearted, engaging. He was confident and composed, much more so than anyone has a right to expect from someone released just hours earlier from Tihar Jail. The speech wasn't sour or vengeful, but inspiring and amusing - the students pressed all around him laughed and cheered much more than they chanted in anger.
The oratory also had passion and restraint, flights of political rhetoric and calmer passages. Wherever Kanhaiya Kumar learnt how to address a crowd, he learnt it well. In some ways, it's a tribute to Indian public life - where the mass meeting, and the speaking skills required, has retained a role lost in many other democracies.
The BBC and indeed much of the news media have described Kanhaiya's Kumar's speech as "fiery". That doesn't do it justice. This wasn't an angry tirade; there was no call to the barricades; it wasn't simply a recitation of leftist dogma. Kumar delivered a polished piece of oratory - the more remarkable for being delivered off-the-cuff - which has succeeded in its key political goal. The tables have been turned spectacularly - the winds is in the sails of the JNU students and their allies, and it's the government and the police that are now on the ropes.
The students' union leader also succeeded in reclaiming the word azaadi (freedom) - the politically-charged term at the heart of the whole JNU drama - for the range of issues of social justice and political inclusion on which the left campaign.
Not freedom from India, but freedom in India - he declared. That's quite a slogan!
Most of those who took to social media overseas were, I imagine, young, progressive, ex-pat Indians relishing that one of their own (perhaps more in generation than political sympathies) was achieving such acclaim.
It brought to mind the great young radical orators of a previous era - Angela Davis, Tariq Ali, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. And that points to the most pressing problem for Kanhaiya Kumar and his political allies.
Having caught the attention of the nation, and caught the mood of many of India's educated young: what next?(Andrew Whitehead, a former BBC Delhi correspondent, is an honorary professor at the University of Nottingham and at Queen Mary, University of London.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Wow how many NDTV is going to write.Below is judgement. <br/>
Refusing to concede that the slogans raised by the students could be protected under fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, Judge Rani called it a kind of infection, from which students are suffering, which needs to be controlled/cured before it becomes an epidemic.

                            "The feelings or the protest reflected in the slogans need introspection by the student community whose photographs are available on record holding posters, carrying photographs, of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat," the judge said while adding: "The thoughts reflected in the slogans raised by some of the students of JNU who organized and participated in that programme cannot be claimed to be protected as fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. I consider this as a kind of infection from which such students are suffering which needs to be controlled/cured before it becomes an epidemic."<br/><br/>

                            Now little Andrew Whitehead wants to jump on the bandwagon!  I am an ex-pat Indian and I do not see the reactions that Whitehead describes, albeit I do not take to social media.  Those ex-pat Indians who I am in touch with just see a scrounger aged around 30 living off the tax-payers hard earned money!  His speeches are full of platitudes!  He wants freedom from various oppressions without saying exactly how these oppressions manifest themselves, what he would advocate doing to rid India of the oppressions, whether he has a plan that can be scrutinised and costed.  This is a character destined to be a life long scrounger, he will contribute nothing to India's well-being and post being a media darling will revert to his natural place in Indian society as a nobody!

                            His speech reminded me of rhetoric of left parties in 50s. Nothing came of it. The left could do nothing . Their record in West Bengal is for everyone to see. But he must realise that world has changed . Russia and China have changed. There is no way you can go back to those days. If Kanhaya wants such a model he should look at North Korea. Wonder what they are teaching in JNU .at an annual expenses 2.33 lakhs per student per annum is an astronomical price to pay for such learning

                            I saw the so called "speech" of this depraved piece of filth called kanhaiya kumar ...... it wasn't a speech, it was the rant of a perverse sick mind ...... it had no ideology, no content ...... all it had was a visceral loathing for the hindu religion, hindus in general, the bjp, the rss, and of course every non-hindu's object of hatred - narendra modi.  he wants a dialogue? he wants to debate? if thats what this pervert keeps challenging the hindus to, fine. lets debate. on issues. can he? all he did was unleash a visceral loathing for hindus, the hindu religion, the rss, the bjp and narendra modi. and people want to call that electrifying. LOL. every point ...... I emphasise ...... every single point that he said was an affront to a sane patriotic mind that loves india, and a point by point rebuttal of every bit of nonsense that he spoke is some thing that anyone with a below average intelligence can put out, it is no rocket science.  if a soldier leaves his post and flees he is termed a deserter. if a cricketer throws his wicked he is said to fixed the match and is called a traitor.  what if someone runs away from life?? a person who commits suicide ...... is a hero?? wow. that's some definition of a "hero" these traitors have got there. he gave a detailed explanation of ...... er ...... his, and the leftist's, words of devotion, communion, prayer ...... "lal salaam". lol. that's the only prayer they know since they are atheists. he said it means a salute to revolution. great. you guys want to revolt?? that's great. revolt all you want. overthrow this government, if you can. can you?? the left is wiped out, not just in india but all over the world. so what do this pathetic losers called the left do?? lol. "lal salaam  lal salaam". and they do not even know the meaning of democracy. he said 61% of Indians had "rejected" modi and only 39% had voted for him. and all the morons that made up the crowd there laughed, sniggered, guffawed, shrieked in gleeful mirth ...... what else can could those knuckleheads have done?? the very basis of the concept of "democracy" is beyond these idiots. let them take a random sample of adults in this pervert's native village in Bihar and they would find that more than 61% of those sampled use tobacco. so does that mean tobacco is to be respected? ha ha. what a debased lot. and the media hails his speech as "electrifying", people in trains and busses are said to hail his speech as having "blown them away". wow. humans are said to have evolved from the ape but I didn't know that some humans have came a full circle. they have evolved themselves back to the jungle. and as for this guy who everyone is hailing as a hero, the jungle is home. Bihar. the state that the term "jungle raj" was coined for.

                            Just listen to his speech after his release - brilliant both as oratory and in terms of content. Congress or BJP has few speakers of his calibre. I am PROUD of JNU. (I studied there long back, then went to USA to do PhD, and now teach in an international university). No other university will be able to take a person from a poor family who is a first generation learner and build him into such an impressive person with political maturity and awareness matching or exceeding some of our top leaders. Thanks to BJP and Modiji, a star is born! Expect to see or hear more from KK in coming days, Jai Hind!

                            Student politics is where the current crop of leaders have come from and looks like this is where the next crop of leaders will come from, again. Raise a toast to illusioned students who fight on the streets, bleed on the streets and the shrewd politician takes home all the credit for having done nothing. We, the students, must realize this and make course correction accordingly.

                            Right on Andrew! The BJP has helped to create a world leader, who has arrived! The non-sense of sedition charges slapped on so called anti-nationals has become an obsession for the Hindutva Government. May I remind the likes of Smriti Irani that India is a 'nation of nation' and hence the concept of a Nation State has no relevance. The Constitution is specifically designed to address the basis on which Peoples in India with diverse and multilingual,multireligious and multethnic peoples signed on to India. Therefore, so long as one swears to the constitution, he cannot be antinational. India has shown the maturity and democracy has been returned

                            International news? That just shows the power that the visual media wields in the modern world. And how the media -often dancing to the tune of global masters- can turn a villain into a hero. The global powers that be, that do not relish the idea of India emerging as a world player under Modi, want to nip that possibility in the bud by thrusting onto the limelight any &amp; all divisive forces in India. If Kanhaiya Kumar, under whose leadership the so-called cultural event was organized and in which loud slogans of the motley group calling for the destruction of India rent the air, did not approve of the slogans, why didn't he do anything to stop such slogans? Does it mean that he &amp; his comrades were just helpless spectators? No one will be fooled by his claim now that the slogans for independence were not for independence from India but from hunger &amp; whatever else he may claim. Aren't Kanhaiya and the media that is propping him up working hand-in-glove with the forces raising slogans for India's destruction?

                            The speech was absolutely political inside an university where basic and prime purpose is education. The issue of bad sloganeering which had generated so much bad atmosphere, should have been dealt by the elected president of students union. Why he called big leaders' names is not for improving the education in JNU. He certainly spoke under the guidance of some opposition parties to malign ruling party.

                            After it's only business for all TRP driven social media !  Earlier also the same social media with their usual biased political lineage unleashed attack on the ruling Party, duly spreading blatant lies - for example in Delhi they did it with such lies on attack of churches - result: AAP won and later it is proved that this anarchist party was behind the social media.  Similarly in Bihar - there caste-based politics and accordingly Dadri &amp; Beef were become issues and spread lies - result: fodder scam hero &amp; his patronage won the battle !  Again these paid social media won along with them !  Now, again the assembly elections are in the cards, particularly in two leftists stronghold (?!) States, Kerala &amp; Bengal !  But, here beef or Dadri or similar issues don't help and hence they systematically moulded issue - JNU !  After the elections, like all other issues, as above, JNU will also vanish in thin air !

                            A narrow file of JNUites who sound rather clueless about what the world is beyond their limited campus and constricted firmament are getting hyperbolic about nothing. Lets accept for a while that Kanhaiya personally did not utter anything anti-national and as he is claims that he is just anti establishment. Why is he piling all hubris on the current dispensation which happens to be BJP? Why does he accept so graciously the mollycoddling of Congress and Left who through their own devious ideologies have done nothing out of the blue for the poor for whom Kanhaiya has a bleeding heart?<br/>
Why this hypocrisy?<br/>
Sorry sir. Your observation of him as a 'rise of a phenomenon' is influenced by the undue attention by media. He is nothing more than a rabble rouser and India has, unfortunately, no dearth of his ilk.<br/>
Again your observation that the educated youth of the country is inspired by his rhetoric is flawed.<br/>
He is just a dreamer not yet jolted by reality. A Quixote riding on a high horse from Utopia. The strain of his philosophy has already wasted youth and destroyed states and nation.

                            I checked BBC, CNN and many other international news and no one bothered to mention it, the reason is obvious, they never support Commies. May have appeared in Pak new or Al Jazeera which I think makes it international

                            History and mythology are full of evidenses, whenever there is crisis in social system someone appear from nowhere to challenge that crisis. Krishna of Mahabharat, Mohammed in Islam, Carl Marx, Lenin Mao, Gandhi, Mandella are examples to be cited. Since the advent of radical group RSS India is facing such crisis. Their in coming to power was a result of mistrust between the then UPA govt and people in general Due to large scale scam. Options were few for the people to choose from. AAP was a new party. Regional parties were not strong enough to counter BJP which emerged unchallenged charged with radical ideas accompanied with promises of moon and paradise which they later shed saying it was poll Jumla(rhetoric). The angry youth community which supported it during election are now distancing from BJP as they failed to fulfill promises. People in general got fed with radical ideas because it limits liberty, equality and fraternity the very essence of democracy. The ruling party is aware of its limitations yet harping on old tried and tested radical ideas because only this idea that make them different from others and is helpful for their existence because however marginal followers of such extremist ideas always existed.

                            For the last few days I started a new hobby.Instead of copying from Books on Usage,Idioms and <br/>
adjectives, I started collecting the adjectives used by Journalists to pep up some LEADERS to superhuman levels. I collected some 100 which were used to describe the word "SPOKE" as something<br/>
very different, when the action of another political leader ,Claiming to be  youth at 48, was <br/>
praised by many papers and media! Even his mere "NO" was  "RUBBISHED" in media reporting!!<br/>
The next personality is mr.Kanhaiya, and there is shower of praise and adjectives to express his SPEACH! Whether Indian College campuses had any shortage of such speaches during the last 50 years? And as the article ends withe the question.....What  NEXT?

                            Andrew- Kumar is not at JNU to give speeches. He is a student who is able to afford university because of public funding provided by the people of India. All the social ills that pervade India predate the current government and indeed the current definition of India itself. Clearly this is an orchestrated political stunt being supported by anti government forces inside and outside India. Please call a spade a spade. While we all like to invoke the idealistic writings of Thoreau and Chomsky once in a while; realities of life are quite different and much more complicated.

                            "Most of those who took to social media overseas were, I imagine, young, progressive, ex-pat Indians relishing that one of their own (perhaps more in generation than political sympathies) was achieving such acclaim." True that about political sympathies.

                            Truly the new leader has clarity of thought purified by the rough and tumble of the Indian experience where in some moments of sheer brilliance even a rain drop lands at the right place.At last there is someone who can talk unapologetically about an inclusive india.
