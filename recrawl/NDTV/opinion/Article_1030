Headline::::Modi Government Is Playing With Fire At JNU



DateTime::::2016-02-15T14:27:00+05:30




                                On the night of February 9, at a cultural evening at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, a few hundred students, perhaps joined by a few outsiders, rent the air with slogans denouncing the hanging of Afzal Guru and demanding "Azaadi" for Kashmir. Apparently, one of the slogans sought the dismemberment of India.
Modi's government has cracked down on those at the function, arresting the JNU Students' Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on the charge of "sedition". The same BJP is earnestly attempting to reconstruct its alliance in J&K with the PDP who openly declare that Afzal Guru's hanging was a travesty of justice, and his mortal remains must be returned to his family in Kashmir for appropriate funeral rites. Hunting with the hounds and running with the hare has always been a BJP specialty.  
 
The issue, however, is far more serious than the inconsistency and opportunism of BJP politics. Its origins go back to that moment in history - 1919 - when the Government of India Act disappointed those who trusted the colonial authority really meant it when they promised substantial self-government to Indians at the conclusion of World War I, but were shocked to find the betrayal of the 1919 Act reinforced by the Rowlatt Act, named after the President of the Imperial Legislative Council, which reiterated that "sedition" - the incitement of disaffection against the Crown - was a crime punishable with up to six years in exile in a foreign prison. Sir Sidney Rowlatt had earlier chaired the Sedition Committee that recommended the indefinite extension of the wartime Defence of India Act. In 1908, Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak had been sentenced to six years in Mandalay on the charge of sedition. Later, in 1922, Mahatma Gandhi was tried and sentenced for sedition after the first Non-Cooperation Movement. The JNU's student union president has been charged with the same crime by independent India. It is a provision of the Indian Penal Code that had been characterized by Jawaharlal Nehru as "obnoxious".
 
Sedition, in section 124A of the IPC, is defined as "exciting disaffection" towards the government by promoting "disloyalty" or "feelings of enmity". While the "Explanations" statutorily added to the section seek to mitigate interpretations of sedition that might contravene the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the right to seek lawful change, it remains possible for the authority to invoke the section to crack down with brutality on those who are deemed "anti-national". It is, however, not a section to be invoked against students in a university who are peacefully, if vociferously, giving vent to their political opinion.
 
This is less a matter of jurisprudence than prudent handling of secessionist sentiment. For if the Modi government can negotiate with the avowedly separatist National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isaac-Muivah), without resorting to section 124A, and interact with the Hurriyat in Kashmir that is not reconciled to the state being an integral part of India, it is certainly an abuse of power that Kumar has been detained even though he and the Students Federation of India, of which he is a member, have denied that he or they joined the slogan-mongering for "Azad" Kashmir or the dismantling of India.
 
Then again, the government needs to learn from history. In Indian history, the sedition laws had the opposite of the intended effect. Far from smothering anti-Empire sentiment, the Rowlatt Act and the happenings that flowed from it, particularly Jallianwalla Bagh, ended the illusion of a benevolent Imperial order and constituted, in many decisive ways, the turning point when the demand for a greater measure of association of Indians with the governance of the country was transformed into the demand for Swaraj. Gandhiji relinquished his Kaiser-e-Hind medal. Motilal Nehru virtually abandoned his enormously lucrative law practice to come to the legal aid of the hapless victims of martial law who faced imprisonment or even the gallows for alleged acts of "sedition". Returning his knighthood, Rabindranath Tagore, in a scathing hand-written letter to the Viceroy declared, "The very least I can do for my country is to take all the consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring".
If Modi thinks he can drive the JNU students into a "dumb anguish of terror", he is wholly mistaken. He has only generated a massive resolve among students and youth everywhere in the country to resist a government that so blatantly abuses the law.
 
The indubitable fact is that there is a section of public opinion in the Valley that does seek "azaadi". It has to be dealt with firmly but principally through debate, discussion and dialogue. Invoking sedition laws only provokes them to greater determination to promote their cause. We must always bear in mind that however vocal and aggressive they might be, they constitute a minority of Kashmiri opinion. That is why they shy away from elections, even as up to 90 per cent of the electorate in so disturbed an area as Kishtwar vote in the panchayat elections despite threats from militants and terrorists, as also in assembly and Parliament polls. So long as theirs is a voice with some audience in Kashmir, we have to realistically expect its reverberations in a cosmopolitan university like JNU. Indeed, it is a tribute to inclusion in higher education that deserving Kashmiri students are welcomed on the rolls of the university.
 
Contemporary history also shows that persuasion rather than a harsh crackdown better ensures the integrity of the nation. After all, the Dravidian movement was secessionist for a full 15 years after Independence, but was coaxed into the mainstream, not by banning it or throwing its leaders into jail, but by welcoming its political leader, CN Annadurai, into the Rajya Sabha and letting them see that Indian democracy was as much for the Tamils as for any other Indian.
 
So also was Rajiv Gandhi's masterstroke in Mizoram in 1986 to end two decades of insurgency. By appointing the leader of the Mizo National Front, Laldenga, as the Chief Minister immediately after signing the peace agreement, and the elected Congress Chief Minister, Lalthanhawla, stepping down to serve as Deputy to the man who had been gunning for him for years, violence-ridden Mizoram has now been rendered the most peaceful state in the country.
 
Similarly, in Assam in 1985, asking the elected Congress Chief Minister, Hitendra Saikia, to step down, and encouraging Prafulla Mahanta to field his Assam Gono Parishad in the elections that followed, when the defeat of the Congress and the victory of the AGP was assured, was what brought the state back to normalcy. Political wisdom does not lie in draconian laws but in statesmanship.
 
Finally, consider the treatment of secession in several developed countries. The obvious example is Scotland. Their leaders are not subjected to sedition laws but to referenda. The Scottish National Party, Britain's Hurriyat, lost the last referendum but ended in the general elections that followed as the third-largest party in the House of Commons. Their avowed objective is to beak up the United Kingdom. However, they are not thrown into jail but advised to prove that they have a majority.
Similarly, in Canada, the demand for "Quebec Libre", that is independence for the French-speaking province of Quebec, has repeatedly been put to the vote and repeatedly defeated - albeit sometimes by razor-thin margins. Yet no Canadian government sees fit to bung people into prison for demanding "azaadi". In France, the demand for independence for Brittany (Bretagne) and in Spain for the Basque lands is handled in the same way - democratically and politically. It is usually national unity that wins out. A nation's sovereign integrity is best assured in a democracy by deft political handling, not police action.
 
Of course, the Modi government's intention might be quite different - rousing hyper-nationalist sentiment in JNU to open the way to definitively denying minority status to the Aligarh Muslim University. They are playing with fire, but their ulterior objective is to polarize political opinion on communal lines as the BJP readies for its final political litmus test - the UP elections a year from now.

                            Which is more 'seditious', I am at a loss to know.  A former cabinet Minister going to an un-friendly country and urging them to remove a democratically elected government or these JNU students screaming anti-India slogans IN India, I cannot decide.

                            What a waste of space for this idiot.  Your CONgi Govt. hanged Afzal guru.  It handled the situation badly.  You did wait for "Opportune moment" to hang in the dark. You waited for him to write "memoirs" of his jihadist activities.  Who is responsible for the venom his literature spew? Werent you?<br/><br/>
Supreme Court has branded him a terrorist and served justice saying that he has to be hanged.  There cannot be any more debate of his innocence IF you believe in Supreme Propriety of Law of Land how ever convoluted you think so. Comparing this situation to the freedom struggle of Rowlatt Act is utter nonsense and shows that you have lost some marbles from your empty brain.<br/><br/>
This is sheer twisting of facts to suit your vested minority appeasement policies and nothing else.  If you are human you would and should have felt an ounce of patriotism when he was hanged for attacking the Parliament for which you proclaimed allegiance to.

                            Ok, this article is wrong at some many levels after trough reading, comparing Late Tilak &amp; Gandhi to some young Bimbo's Grads and Student, who we all know for what reasons are supported by many Anti-National Movements (not Sentiment's). Words are so great, when you carefully use them. <br/><br/>
I again say these are not Anti National Slogans or Sentiment's, theses are fully fledged Anti National Movements and all security agency should make sure these threats are Neutralized to the strictest possible end, and lets stick by the books for the way.<br/><br/>
If any of these bimbo's including the author achieve, just 1% of Logic or Deeds what these Great Legends made, if would print a 100 copies of this comment and Eat it with great pleasure.<br/><br/>
Jai Hind.

                            IF RG is seen supporting Anti-National That does falls under Instigating for Waging war or Attempt to Waging War Against India and Sedition charges. a Tough punishment follows. Beware of such Anti-national Instigation RG you must face Jail Term of atleast Life Term for you alleged instigations.

                            Look who's talking!!A congress member &amp; member of parliament from back door,who goes to enemy country and asks them to remove democratically elected government in India is now giving a sermon to Indians!This frustrated man, who wanted Modiji to sell tea in congress convocations, has not only lost his face &amp; people's mandate but his mind too.Congress members like Mani, diggi, Salman Khurshid(also went to Pakistan and spoke against the government) who had letdown and embarrassed Congress Party from time to time,are free without business nowadays.They are intoxicating their VP, Rahul Gandhi,who lacks political and ethical wisdom, running behind every issue to score petty political agenda, doesn't know difference between Anti-national activities/sloganeering and freedom of speech.Frustrated Congress and Left Parties must not play with Fire when it comes to Unity and Integrity of the Country.When our Armed forces are sacrificing their lives to protect our borders and fighting terrorist from across the borders, political parties and their supporting mouthpiece media organisation are playing petty politics to corner the Government.This will not only harm the morale of our Forces but give enemy countries/terrorist handle to strike again.Everybody should stand behind the Government when it comes to unity and integrity of the Nation.Government should take strict action so that this kind of anti India activities does not takes place in any educational institution.The matter must be investigated and Culprits and thir supporters must must be booked and put behind the bars for life.

In democracy we accept judicial system has important role to play. That judiciary has spent enough time to conclude a case, why this needs to be questioned to propel political cause. Why left and congress have dirtied the water of education institutes in the past and why they complain now. If there is a law, it must be implemented. You had your chance now let others run the country for next 3 years peacefully

                            I am quite amazed by Mani's argument when he talks about the  treatment of secession in several developed countries and he seems to be firmly supporting the idea of referendum to deal with the secessionists. Kashmiris have been demanding the same thing for long time and where promised the same thing by Mani's great grandfather JawaharLal Nehru. I am just surprised why dosent Mani's intellect work when it comes to Kashmir.

                            Wrongful arrests apart, it is timid to not even talk of Kashmir when the whole world knows India's and Pak's positions. For far too long we have referred to the vexed issue as the 'K' word and not discussed it. We need to face up to the problem at least internally at a time when we propose to hold talks with Pak itself.

                            Sologan of Anti India is being made. Rahul Gandhi and many more are comming in their support. Who is playing with fire. They want to divide the country. Afzal Guru was hanged by Previous Govt, Was judiciary was wrong in pronouncing justice to them. These so called secular are testing Majority blood power. These internal terrorist should indentified and put behind the bar. One day these JNU people will say Mumbai 26/11 was also good. Rahul Gandhi by attending their meeting supported the attack on Parliament, for which Afzal Guru was convicted

                            I Fully support Mani Shakar Aiyar for bringing in the past history to show how the past government has patiently dealt with situation such as the present government is facing. BJP known for its over Zealous nationalist whose propaganda is to make India 100% hindu (not realising the fact that there are millions of Indian  citizens in Christians countries like US, and European countries) is known for taking hasty steps only to regret later and cry over spilled milk. This new government has been in the news in India and abroad for all wrong reasons. India known for being a largest democratic country is being taken for a ride under the leadership of the RSS who dictate the government in every aspect be it political, education ...etc.<br/><br/>
We who are educated and have a common sense should raise our voices against any communalism played by BJP government to please the RSS, no doubt the congress too fail by allowing corruption to play a spoil sports.<br/><br/>
The high handedness of Delhi police in handling the JNU incident only shows the lack of statesmanship to bring the erring students to a dialogue and hear their grievances and bring to an amicable solutions. Hope there will be some responsible person who will take the middle path and bring everything on the negotiable table and not resort to punitive actions because its not flowing in line with their malicious propaganda.

                            Please spare a thought for the thousands of soldiers and civilians who have died in battle or have been brutally murdered by the friends of Afzal Guru. Lakhs of Kashhmiri Hindus have been evicted from their homes in Kashmir and rendered refugees in their own country as part of the ethnic and religious cleansing carried out by organisations that Afzal was associated with in.  Neither Canada nor England is battling the kind of insurgency that India is a victim of since independence.<br/>
 Why should the taxpayer fund nearly Rupees three lakh per student at JNU only see the institution being used as a springboard for breaking up the country?<br/>
  Would the US govt tolerate students organizing  rallies in leading US universities Eulogizing Osama Bin laden and observing his death anniversary with a call to destroy the US? Would such a thing be tolerated in any other European country? Would for that matter such a thing be tolerated in Pakistan? Just see what a Pakistani have to suffer just for being a fan of an Indian cricketer!

I have been following this even and seen lots of debt over the news channel, When no action has been taken your party was saying Govt is no sufficient moral to take on anti-national activity, when govt did it's you guys are saying its wrong.<br/><br/>
This issue has been so politicize now that no one from opposition is trying to say what students did wrong but trying to take on Govt, Let me tell you I am not supporter or either BJP or Cong, I have also seen that when France attacked, all civilians and parties of that country said they are with Govt, no body questions the motive of Govt, But in India its completely opposite, No one has said or went to soldiers who died in Siachen but they find it attractive to go find some new opportunism in JNU anti national slogan instead of debating from were they learned it!!

                            Mr. Mani Shanker Iyer,<br/><br/>
No doubt your knowledge of international happenings is reflected in your writing, but sometimes in the name of forthrightness you have  transgressed decency in your utterances bordering on undiluted snobbery. Had it not been for your sardonic 'chaiwala' comment against Narendra Modi, things might not have been as bad for your party as they appear to be now. You are an experienced bureaucrat and politician and don't need to be reminded of the importance of remarks of a public figure. Such derogatory comments have been used to build public sentiments against your already scam-tainted party. Consequently, your party is now on the sidelines while those not fit to rule, occupy the political centre stage. Because of your party's high brow, disdainful attitude towards  lesser mortals, people are suffering under the rule of divisive monsters. There is little to choose between the two parties as has Mr. Arun Shourie rightly pointed out in his statement that BJP is 'scaled up Congress plus cow'. That is why 'low brow' commoners are gradually getting  alienated from your party as also are on the way to ousting this obnoxiously haughty ruling party. Bihar and Delhi have 'shone the ray', other states are now bent on showing them the way. Everyone can see through Modi's deliberate attempts at  marginalising Nehru-Gandhi clan but despite being well-read you scorned at Modi by slighting the stature of the common man. You are well aware of the importance of public sentiments. If your party nurtures any hope of a 'Congress Renaissance', it must learn from the greatness of the common man.Though small in status.at an appropriate time, he has the capacity to put all conmen in their right place. Robert Vadra made a similar indiscreet comment by terming 'Aam Admi' as'Mango Man' and another member of your elitist party describing a railway compartment or economy class as 'Cattle Class'. Was it PC or ST, both well-read yet insensitive. In this era of Aam Admi Party, genuine compassion and wisdom are more relevant than erudition. If Congress has to survive in this awakened democracy, here is a message for the elitists in the party,  please 'Be Warned, Be Vigilant and Be Prudent' in use of words as well as your deeds.<br/><br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>
A Low Brow Common Man

                            Intellectually chained to obsequence to "Gora Sahib" even though parents were physically liberated in 1947.  <br/><br/>
Marx was right when he said that "the weakest minds take the longest to liberate".  Unfortunately you will not be able to liberate your mind in this lifetime and finally start taking pride in your nation and culture like the rest of us.<br/><br/>
I feel sorry for you and all those dependent on you for their future. It's a pathetic way to earn your living by abusing your own nation, culture and democratically elected leaders. It must be impossible to be able to look at the mirror each morning without guilt, shame and confusion.

                            And you people are stoking it to keep it alive. Isn't it? The moment somebody say something against Sonia or Rahul, we have seen the spontaneous out bursts of much greater height. What about that. You are ready to accept dismemberment of India as a casual remark?

                            Mr. Mani has developed a habit or into policy of no one good other than Rajiv like Amma devotees from Tamil Nadu. For a intrupted water supply and milk man delivery failure, we would blame modi. For no rain and too hot climates would also he would blame it on modi. Grow up our dear mani sir.
