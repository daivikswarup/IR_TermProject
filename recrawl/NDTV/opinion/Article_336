Headline::::AAP's 5 New Year Resolutions



DateTime::::2014-12-31T15:26:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January. The former 
journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister
 Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)2014 has been a defining year for the country; it ended an old "consensus" and brought to the fore a new one. The "interregnum" which started a decade ago has almost ended. The pendulum hanging "confused" for so long has finally taken a decisive swing. But "equilibrium" is yet to be found.It was a year of change. But change just for the sake of change adds no value. The year 2014 has seen two agents of change - Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal - both representing two different kinds of social forces and both will have deep impact on the society at large. Modi's impact as an agent of change has to be seen. As for Kejriwal and AAP, as a commitment of our drive for change, here are 5 New Year Resolutions: AAP's biggest resolve in the New Year is to speed up the process of clean politics as AAP believes that politics has touched a new low with the kind of money and muscle power which has been infused in recent elections. AAP in 2013 has proved that clean politics is possible and a common man/woman can fight elections without money power and dirty games. The moral compass of politics has been made to take a hike for far too long. It has to come back be ensconced in its rightful place. Politics is a game of power, and power devoid of morality is brute and without authority. For an institution to remain supreme, it is essential to be governed by moral values, not by dry rules and regulations. Governance is beautiful but governments are crude and ugly. Many people who are leaders have a lot of insecurities and they make the system opaque. For governance to be effective and trust worthy, it has to be transparent and accountable. The leadership of AAP has been fighting for transparency and accountability in government structure and functioning before the inception of the party, and it will be its third resolve to keep that fight going.Grassroots is a nice word but these days it treated like an artefact kept in a museum for tourists to glimpse. There is no regular emergence of new leaders. Monopolisation of leadership is a curse which will cost India dearly. AAP has created new leaders in the past and will fight to create fertile ground for the new leaders to emerge. Finally, for politics to be effective, it has to be fought on real issues and not imaginary ones. India, even after 68 years of independence, has failed to provide basic facilities to its citizens. But the leadership has conspired to make people forget that their issues are not addressed and instead "fake issues" are used as diversionary tactics. AAP is of the firm belief that Roti - Kapda - Makaan (bread - clothes - housing) is more important than Mandir - masjid - gurudwara - girjaghar (temple - mosque - church). AAP has been talking to the people of Delhi on these issues and has been getting a fantastic response. It is our resolve to make coming elections and thereafter a referendum on these basic issues.It is a long fight. The lost equilibrium has made India's politics lopsided and normalcy will not come easily. It has to be fought for and the resolve has to be rock solid. The New Year will be another mile stone in this fight.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            AAP has not come forward as political alternative- it has come as a force of alternative politics...The difference is so huge that most people do not even understand what it means..<br/>
I t essentially and simply means that -an average Indian-be it poor or rich- is asking its Govt- <br/>
1-what are you doing with my money?<br/>
2-what have you done about my security?<br/>
3- where in the pyramid of power is my Needs and requirements<br/>
4- How can you make my life simpler, easier, cleaner<br/>
and finally telling them<br/>
5 that I refuse to accept the shoddy way you have been treating us-I now have a voice...<br/>
Modi coming in Centre was anti incumbency and he won more due to Congress's misdeeds than his own glorious past-AAP has constantly and consistently done its job of raising pertinent voices and it will continue to do so..

                            This schoolboy essay would attract few, if any marks if submitted in an exam.  The very first paragraph is full of meaningless clichés and drifts between unrelated topics.  Sadly for NDTV readers, as one continues reading, matters become worse.<br/><br/>
If this is the standard that the top communicator of AAP employs, God help the poor people of Delhi should he and the other clowns making up the AAP come into power.<br/><br/>
The message the essay is trying to convey is not worth commenting on; the writer himself does not know!

What is the future of AAP without kejariwal. There is no credible face apart from Mr Kejariwal. Please focus on your own party first. There is complete lack of transparance in AAP.

                            AAP has been eliminated from national level although AAP thought they would make a big gang in national politics.  Kejriwal has become a national joke.After the next assembly election in Delhi, Kejriwal will be history for ever. I suggest he should start preparing his CV for sarching job. He has already wasted 2 years from hi career.

AAP to Nikale Sabke BAAP.<br/>
It never occurred to us that Kejriwal(Arvind_Muffler Man) belongs to a cast.<br/>
All he was or is about Anti Corruption acts. Now that He is  self proclaimed and declared "Bania",We have no confusion in our minds. Now We can choose any of the 3 parties , with out having the guilt of supporting communal, castiest or corrupt parties,as now it has become the common eligibility character.Now I know, why he priced a tea at Rs20000/- that is the castly product.<br/><br/>

You joined the party when AK was CM. This is called opportunistic attitude. AAP has mostly opportunists. Good people mostly left.
