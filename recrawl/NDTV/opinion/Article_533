Headline::::For Farmers, Rahul Walks in Rajiv's Footsteps



DateTime::::2015-04-30T15:30:00+05:30




                                As photographs and news items fill the newspapers of Rahul Gandhi's rail journeys and walking tours of states afflicted worst by farmers' distress and his championing of the cause of farmers in the Lok Sabha, my mind races back to 1987, a comparable year of natural calamity that had the whole country reeling in agrarian crisis. The major difference is that Rahul is only a leader of the Opposition; in 1987, his father was Prime Minister.
Notwithstanding the onerous demands on his Prime Ministership, Rajiv accorded his highest priority to touring the affected areas of the country, ranging from Kashmir and terrorist-ridden Punjab, to Rajasthan and Gujarat and Maharashtra; out to Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Nagaland; and south to Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. There was not a single affected state or area that was left out. He was present whenever and wherever the farmer needed him most.In conspicuous contrast, the present Prime Minister is everywhere except where a farmer is to be found. He wanders far, wide and frequently all over the world - so did Rajiv - but unlike Rajiv he has no inclination to search out domestic distress. This is not only a question of poor time management; it also reflects the arrogance and heartlessness that are so characteristic of Modi, the man.
The combination of drought and floods that hit the country from the summer of 1987 well into 1988 was traced to the El Nino effect. Fortunately, El Nino has never after hit us since quite so badly but even the lesser effect is having drastic consequences for our farmers because the Government is so slow-footed and so preoccupied with its alternative agenda of purloining the farmer's land that, notwithstanding the agrarian crisis, it carries on with business as usual (the pun is intentional).
Rajiv's first action when the crisis hit us in 1987 was to convene a meeting of Chief Ministers in New Delhi on September 3 to secure their suggestions and the endorsement of a draft Action Plan that had been prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture. Although current distress has been on the public radar for several months, Modi has been too preoccupied taking cruises on the Seine to find time to concert the efforts of the Central and State governments to bend the national will of the nation as a whole to taking the steps required to mitigate and overcome the natural disasters that have combined to hit the nation in its solar plexus. Instead of action, his agriculture minister waffles in Parliament and so aggravates the Opposition with his non sequiturs that all of them walk out in protest. Meanwhile, Modi applauds his minister for his oratory. This government is completely out of touch with the national mood.
Before we come to the extraordinary achievements of the 1987 Rajiv Action Plan, let us first recall the clarion call that Rajiv Gandhi sounded at that gathering of chief ministers. He said that we were faced "with the most serious challenge" as "1987 has brought a drought which is truly exceptional" - just as 2015 is faced with a "truly exceptional" and "serious" challenge. He stressed that "the rains have been seriously deficient in large parts of the country" and added that "in some States (he had Rajasthan, in particular, in mind) this is the third or even fourth consecutive year of drought." He underlined the point that "this year's drought is comparable to the drought of 1965" - the worst till then since Independence. He went on to say that "we cannot meet it (the drought) with routine responses" as "the situation calls for a total mobilization of national will." Have we heard anything comparable from the present Prime Minister?And unlike the present Prime Minister, instead of confining himself to alliterations, acronyms and slogans, Rajiv Gandhi presented the Chief Ministers with an Action Plan for Drought and Flood Relief to deal with issues of "employment, drinking water and fodder". He then set out specific steps to meet the challenge: maximize output in the coming season "by providing our farmers with the inputs they need"; organize relief works "oriented" towards both "providing employment" as also "ensuring a degree of drought-proofing in the affected areas"; off-setting the shortfall in hydroelectric power generation by "special efforts to step up thermal generation"; and "use our public distribution system to the fullest advantage". These major measures were in addition to measures already taken, such as rescheduling loans; providing funds for drinking water; advance release of funds for rural employment works (Rajasthan received in just one year funds equal to the previous forty years for employment relief); and additional imports of edible oils. He urged both central and state governments to rise to the occasion and asked for "close and continuous cooperation between them" so that "employment in rural areas" is assured; "wages must be distributed regularly and in full"; "strict vigilance against malpractices"; and "effective management for work programmes" for "several million people". That is how a government that works, works!
He then visited state after state, usually driving himself for hundreds of miles from earliest dawn to long after the sun had set to see for himself what ground action was being taken. Thereafter, till well past midnight, he would meet with State officials and ministers to review their work and make course corrections. These were never general, broad reviews, but detailed, micro-exercises that kept officialdom on their toes and sent an unmistakable signal that their every move was being monitored. I saw all this with my own eyes for I was invariably on all these tours.
The result? India's cereals production soared from 113 million tonnes in calendar year 1988 to 36 million tonnes the following year - the single largest increase in annual output ever scored in India's agricultural history. It signally contributed to India's growth rate in 1988-89 crossing the double-digit mark for the first and only time in India's economic history - 10.67 per cent! Not even once during the entire post-reforms period have we come close to beating that record. That is what is meant by rising to a national challenge, not traveling to distant shores to spew rubbish about "Scam India" and "Skill India" while the country reels under rain and hail damage.
Rahul is walking in his father's footsteps. He does not have the power that Rajiv had as PM. But from his place on the Opposition benches, Rahul is doing what our PM should be doing - reaching out to the farmers in their homes and their mandis to understand what the krishak and the khet mazdoor are facing, and coming up with practical solutions to practical problems. Modi spends his time not in solidarity with the farmer but in spinning around salubrious climes, in a kind of frenzy over "have 'plane, will travel". Do you now see why farmers' suicides have reached levels undreamt of even in the terrifying drought of 1987? We had a caring Prime Minister then. We have now in his son a caring leader of the Opposition. But in the Prime Minister we have a callous, self-absorbed failure, quite unworthy of the position to which he has been pitch-forked: "if you have tears, prepare to shed them now."(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Rajiv walked all over the country to share farmers' distress, the Congress was in power for 17 out of 27 years since then, and yet they did so much for the farmers that one unseasonal rain brings them to their knees.<br/><br/>
Maybe, this is why the people ensured Rahul is merely in the opposition? He can tour as much as he likes now, and no-one will care!

                            This man is absolute sycophantic of Gandhi family.  What Rahul is doing? Why is he not going to his own constituency if he so concerned about farmers.  He knows nothing about farmer's plight. What did his govt did in 10 years which was the worst time for India.  He is adding to the plight of farmers by misinforming the farmers about land bill and govt policy.  he is unnecessary lead farmers to commit more suicide by make them feel that govt is apathetic which is not true.  <br/><br/>
He is not doing any good rather instigating farmers to commit more suicide.  God please get the country rid of present Gandhi's family and this irritating man otherwise country must be ready to be cursed.

                            Some facts - 1. Rahul is not leader of opposition. What are you smoking ? (2) Modi is doing what Congress didn't do in 60 years. Even small islands like Maldives wasn't listening to India. Sri Lanka was with China. And so was Nepal. Congress had successfully alienated India. Modi is bringing India closer to its neighbours. (3) 60 years of your farmer policies haven't been able to help them. Farmers have killed themselves all these years. So Rahul doing what Rajiv did is like what fools do. Fools don't learn from their mistakes. We don't want our farmers to continue dying. Let's change the policies. (4). We were scam country. No doubt. Where is Kapil Sibal with his zero loss theory. (5).Why are you always licking the feet of your masters. How does Rahul become caring. Lilavati whom he visited 4 years back is still living in extreme poverty. Dalit houses where he did his photo ops are still going without basic life. Caring. Huh. 60 days in Bangkok. He comes back, does some photo ops, becomes caring. Grow up Mani, seriously. You need a thorough medical check-up. Start from your brains. (6) And Mani, has Rahul visited his own constituency from where he got elected. Answer is no. Shocked ? Don't get. That's how Gandhi &amp; its chamchas work (7) Mani - you ran away from the elections fearing defeat and now you are speaking like an idiot on the run

                            Mani you still think people of India are living in 1987 .we have moved on but congress has been left behind. You want to keep poor farmers even more poor so that they live on doles/waivers/subsidy provided by government and thats all you have done in last 10 years. Rahul is more of Media hype and he is taking over from Kejriwal in that aspect.so be happy till the limelight lasts.

Anyways, he meets only congress supporters. If he meets real farmers, somebody might even slap him hard for his government's debacles and agenda of keeping farmers poor for their own vote share.

                            I just don't understand the hypocrisy. The previous govt and its leaders including rahul gandhi, condemned the migration of the people from villages to cities in search of jobs, but when the coming govt., in a way carries forward the policy of creation of livelihood other than agriculture for the villagers near the villages, there is the same set of individuals opposing the very same actions that these parties started.

                            Rahul is NOT the leader of the opposition.For him to be the leader of the opposition constitutionally you need to have 10% of the seats in the Lok Sabha OR be recognized as the leader of the opposition by the ruling party.<br/><br/>
The reason why congress will not reemerge as a significant political force is because it is filled with Gandhi family loyalists line Mani Shankar Aiyar with ZERO political base of their own.My understanding is Mr. Aiyar finished FOURTH in his own constituency.<br/><br/>
Only if Priyanka Gandhi takes charge and ruthlessly purges rent seekers like Mani and create a lean and mean organization can we expect a credible revival.<br/><br/>
Mani Aiyar is doing this song and dance to retain his Rajya Sabha seat by currying favour with Rahul/Sonia.It is a good strategy from his point of view but a disaster for the Congress Party.

                            The biggest question here is - who is farmer? Farmer is the one who do the actual farming, not the landowner. Mostly land owners do not do the farming they either hire farmers on crop sharing basis or lease our their land to farmers. Everything done by earlier govts has resulted in benefits of landowner - raising the price of land and lease value.<br/><br/>
If govt raises the price of say wheat or sugar cane - land owner raises the lease rental increasing the risk of actual framer and in case he looses his crop - his loss will be massive. Who is the loser - the farmer.<br/><br/>
Land owners participate in politics leading the their benefit; and actual farmers works in the field and suffer.<br/><br/>
Check out the people walking with Rahul; all will be landowners...

Now with 10 years of solid non performance,  Mr. Mani talks about Rahul's performance in opposition. What a joke!

If Congress had helped farmers during there disaster rule last 10 years, RAGA wont had to make such PR events.<br/><br/>
In 1987 , Rajiv was actually busy in Bofors deal then helping farmers.

                            Mani the moron was Secretary, Travel and Tours for Rajiv Gandhi.  In other words, he it was who had to ensure that there was toilet paper and other necessities wherever Rajiv parked his derriere for the night.  The excessive praise heaped on Rajiv 'Borfors' Gandhi is misplaced.  He did what his chamchas advised him to do.  All that was 28 years ago before the advent of modern communication.  Modi, as the brilliant leader that he is, is fully apprised of the state of the nation on a minute by minute basis.  He does not have to visit every farm in every village in India to know what is happening.  He has a team and he believes in teamwork. Gone are the days when Mani and his babu pals held sway.  We as Indians find it abhorrent that Mani requires us to assume that the simpleton son of Rajiv, Rahul 'Chintan' Gandhi has inherited his father's perceived strengths and that he is ENTITLED to lead the nation by virtue of his birth.  This means that all others, such as every reader of this column or their children are excluded notwithstanding any merit they possess.  Only those who inhabit the fantasy planet that Mani obviously lives in will accept such a preposterous proposition.  Still, Mani is doing what he is destined to do; namely, live the rest of his miserable life being the loyal sycophant to all generations of the dreadful parivar.  Finally, this line is copied and pasted from the article: 'India's cereals production soared from 113 million tonnes in calendar year 1988 to 36 million tonnes the following year'. Doesn't this moron check his own writing? How can something 'soar' when there is a decrease. A typo perhaps but imagine how the moron would have reacted if he had spotted this in a log written by a BJP supporter!

I remember Rajiv Gandhi's response to the 1987 drought; it was limited to driving in Government maruti gypsie's to villages in Rajasthan and asking villagers "doodh milta hai kya" when the villager said "Nahin" Rajiv would walk off saying "toh accha, double roti milti hogi" This was the best that Rajiv could come up with

If RaGa was so concerned about farmers, why hasn't he visited Maharashtra where many farmers have committed suicides, that too when his own Thappad party was in power along with NCP? Aren't they farmers who have committed suicide? If you want to mislead the public by saying that the proposed landbill is the reason for the suicides, was it that all those who have committed suicides (before this landbill proposal) have anticipated it well in advance and have committed suicide? Please enlighten us.

                            Rahul deserves all the praise for discovering Farmer's suicide now, because during last 10 years of UPA Rule the farmer's suicide was literally ZERO.That is why he did not visit any farmer's house.<br/>
It has come only in BJP rule.<br/>
at the same time BJP has no nerve to counter Rahul drama , as they are bogged down on too many trivial issues of Zero value.

                            If not anything I thought Mr Mani Iyer had atleast common sense.<br/>
Farmers death is not sudden, but due to immediate pressures from failed crops due to un seasonal rains- agreed.<br/><br/>
But Maharashtra - Vidharba is facing grave issue of farmer suicide from last 2+ years and for last 15 years Mahrastra was with Congress vialas rao deshmukh, Ashok chavhan , Prithvi so many stall warts didnt pay attention.<br/><br/>
of course Mr Mani you had center as well with you for 10 yrs and what you did "NOTHING" spent your time in scams and free time giving lectures in foreign universities &amp; institutions. <br/><br/>
Rahul is no body , people trying to praise him to keep congress intact.

                            It seems that loyal Anonymous have great great opinions about their transformed leader. However this sudden change of mind is surprising and this affection was  shown to the farmers of this country after (almost) 6 decades of rule.

                            Mani Shankar Iyer Chamcha of Gandhi family who made the famous tea seller statement which catapulted Mr.Modi to the PM seat. Rahul has to go and visit the farmers what their problems are. Mr.Modi knows what exactly is their problem and is trying to resolve it. He does not need  intensive coaching in politics and how to be a politian unlike Rahul who went on 56 days crash course in politics who is now coming and showing his skills.
