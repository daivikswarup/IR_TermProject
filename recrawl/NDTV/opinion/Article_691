Headline::::Modi Must Release Caste Survey Findings



DateTime::::2015-07-06T15:42:00+05:30




                                The single greatest achievement of the Manmohan Singh regime - which coincided with the Tenth and Eleventh Plans - was pulling 138 million people above the poverty line in that ten-year period. Yet, instead of crowing about this having been the largest number of people to have ever been raised out of poverty in a single decade in world history, and coining infantile slogans to celebrate this as the Modi establishment would have done, the UPA government addressed itself immediately and simultaneously to the larger issue of poverty not being merely an issue of money income and consumption, but a multi-faceted hydra that needed to be tackled on several fronts simultaneously - health, education, mortality, nutrition, sanitation and a host of other parameters.
The principal limitation in defining poverty in terms of a single line, as those above it being APL and those below it being BPL, is that there was no gradation from destitution to deprivation to poverty to vulnerability. Anyone with a consumption of under Rs. 10.50 (at 2004 prices) was classified as "poor" and everyone above it was classified as "not poor". This had two consequences. One, a labourer earning Rs. 11 a day was placed in the same category as a multi-billionaire: both were treated as "non-poor". And when a person's income rose from Rs. 10.49 by two paise to Rs. 10.51, he zoomed from being poor to being "not poor". 
And, indeed, a substantial share of those 138 million who had been aided in escaping the poverty trap were those who had merely moved from this side of threshold below the poverty line to the threshold immediately above it. Statisticians discerned the difference. The new boy sprung from poverty had no idea he had escaped into a Brave New World - until they snatched away from him his BPL card.
Acutely identifying this problem, the left-wing economist Dr Arjun Sengupta tried to take the calculation of poverty into the realm of reality by suggesting that between the BPL category and the APL category, there should be an intermediate category which he called the "vulnerable" - say, those with a daily consumption of Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. He called them "vulnerable" because the least set-back - drought, being thrown out of employment, a failure in petty business, an illness to the income-earner, an illness in the family, an accident - would plunge the person (and his family) back below the singular poverty line. He also came to the startling conclusion that if we add the "poor" and the "vulnerable'", the percentage of India's population desperately in need of poverty alleviation stands at an astounding 77 percent!
Montek Singh Ahluwalia's Planning Commission rejected the Sengupta thesis because the Planning Commission were pushing the argument that India's poor constituted no more than a third of the population (not over three-quarters, as Sengupta suggested) and that the aim should be to reduce the ratio of BPL beneficiaries from a third to a quarter of our people, the better to free resources for a pattern of development which would augment growth rates but widen disparities. The policy alternatives posed by the Sengupta and Ahluwalia approaches were stark. 
Dr. Manmohan Singh and his government provisionally accepted that while we had to go along with the traditional definition of poverty as a thin, singular line, it was imperative that we greatly expand the nation's knowledge of the complex realities of poverty, of the many faces of poverty, if we were to make a really definitive effort at "wiping every tear from every eye" - the injunction of the Mahatma.
In international academic circles, it was being increasingly recognized that poverty comprises multiple deprivations. If you can eat one chapati more, but your child continues going to the same school where the teacher never comes, or your family goes to the same primary health centre which does not stock even aspirin, you are just as deprived before there occurred fortuitously a marginal increase in your income or a marginal adjustment in your daily consumption pattern. You were still poor - wretchedly poor, in your own eyes, in the eyes of your family and friends, in the eyes of the community in which you lived.
Therefore, a much more nuanced, multiple-point understanding of the nature of poverty needed to be arrived at to devise appropriate strategies to really spring people and classes of people from self-perpetuating and mutually reinforcing poverty paradigms. There needed to be quite as much attention to health, education, sanitation etc. as to stepping up monetary earnings.
To this end, Dr. Manmohan Singh's government decided on a survey to ascertain the true nature and composition of poverty in the country on multiple parameters. This they did by commissioning the most massive survey ever of all the accessible data on socio-economic data that they could devise. The economic results show that Sengupta was closer to reality than the Planning Commission. To this, it was decided to add "caste". 
The trickiest part of this survey was the issue of caste. Any overt classification of people on the basis of caste (and its innumerable divisions into sub-castes) was fraught with the danger of provoking caste-conflict and giving a fillip to caste-based politics. On the other hand, to ignore the connection between caste and standards of living, and the quality of life, would amount to hiding from view what is one of the most visible and enduring characteristics of our society. So pervasive has been the role of caste in the evolution of our civilization that non-Hindu communities, like the Muslims and the Christians, have been infected by the caste virus; indeed, reformist religions like Sikhism and Buddhism, born out of a revolt against caste, have subsequently succumbed to the baneful influence of casteism. 
In the circumstances, the UPA government took the incredibly bold, if risky, decision to commission the study as a Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) - the first time this has been attempted since the British in colonial times commissioned a caste census in 1933, the more effectively to divide and rule.
SECC was conceived as a necessary precursor to ensuring truly "inclusive growth" - to economic development really being 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'. But even as the Survey has been published, the Modi sarkar had decided not to reveal the caste data. At one level, this is just opportunism - to not upset the political apple cart on the eve of the Bihar elections. 
But, at a deeper level, this is of a piece with the Modi model of development, first implemented in Gujarat. An Oxford scholar, Nikita Sud, has published an extraordinarily detailed and perceptive study of the state titled "Liberalization, Hindu Nationalism and the State" that she subtitles "A Biography of Gujarat". 
Before coming to the Modi era in the state, she delves deep into Gujarat's mercantile past, its evolution as sea-faring people with wide contacts ranging across the Indian Ocean, all along the Arab coast and out to the African seaboard. Coming to post-Independence India, she uses the term "developmentalism" to describe the take-over by the State under Nehru of the responsibility for pulling the economy out of the colonial quagmire (average growth rate 0.72 per cent, 1914-47) to put the nation on the path of modernization, with a healthy mixture of growth and social justice linked to social harmony through dedicated adherence to the principles of secularism. She then places Modi's Gujarat in the context of the post-1991 shift from "developmentalism to liberalization", with the special Modi bias on denying "even the smallest concession to the poor" so as to ruthlessly push the rate of economic growth whatever the social consequences. Sud shows the policies adopted to foster accelerated industrialization by the private sector too have been "business-friendly rather than market-friendly", in that large business houses were particularly favoured, especially through land acquisition: "the logic of the market was used to undo even partial measures for wider social protection". 
Staggering confirmation of this anti-poor orientation of Gujarat's economic policies under Modi has been revealed by The Economist of London (27 June 2015) that has scooped a UNICEF report which the Modi government has been withholding from publication since October 2014 when it was submitted for routine clearance to the Modi government. The Economist believes "data were held back for political reasons, to avoid embarrassing Mr. Modi" - which explains why, when one set of figures relating to immunization were in fact released, Gujarat alone was left out. The scooped report shows that this was evidently because the figures for Gujarat showed that Gujarat fell from 16th to 21st position under Modi, and at a time of remarkable national performance, tumbled from over-average performance before Modi, to way below the all-India average once Modi took over the reigns of governance in the state, behind Nitish Kumar's Bihar, and only just above North-Eastern states and UP. No wonder the Gujarat figure was suppressed by Modi's central government. 
The UNICEF report also finds that notwithstanding "Swachch Bharat", two-fifths of Gujarat under Modi were defecating in the open - well above the national average. "Gujarat", says The Economist, citing figures from the report "is also worse than the average for stunting (42%), severe stunting (18.5%) and wasting (18.7)".  
Dr. Sud emphasizes that this is not a statistical aberration but the inevitable consequence of a policy that, under Modi, married "economic liberalization" to "political illiberalism" as the BJP rejected the KHAM alliance and raised a Savarnas' "revolt against the widening of democracy, as well as a potentially redistributive state, with Hindu nationalism and gradual, business-friendly liberalization being vehicles for reasserting control over the polity as well as the economy". Dr. Sud further views programmes like Modi's "Aapnu Gujarat" and "Aagvu Gujarat" as designed to "neatly sidestep questions of redistribution and repackages the current economic and political path as a collective, nationalist venture". To reinforce this, "anybody challenging this path is immediately condemned as anti-Gujarat and an 'anti-national terrorist'....The continued deployment of Hindutva and its parochial corollaries is, thus, a response to a narrow business-friendly development in a procedurally institutionalized democracy".

                            Other than a couple of paragraphs as to why the UPA government included caste in the survey, I could not figure out the argument that Mr Aiyer was making as to why the Modi government should release the caste results. <br/>
The first half of the article tom toms the supposedly astounding achievements of the UPA government. This however is unfortunately undercut by this line "the percentage of India's population desperately in need of poverty alleviation stands at an astounding 77 percent!". The next half deals with how Gujarat sucked under Modi rule.<br/>
If after around 60 years of Congress rule, 77% of the population are in need of poverty alleviation, I would hang my head in shame and not make fun of somebody else. Give Modi his 5 years instead of carping. People will vote him out if he does not deliver. Unfortunately Mr Aiyer sits in the Rajya Sabha...the populace lacks the means and the eventual satisfaction of voting him out.

                            After pulling 138 million people out of poverty the UPA was kicked out with such a thud that they got only 44 out of 542 seats or 8%? Are you an absolute idiot or you think that the people of India are absolute cretins? Agreed that as a Congress stooge you cannot comment on the massive scams and incompetent governance that got the UPA booted out. The usual reliance on obscure authors or ignorant foreign journals to buttress your stupid observations. Grow up and smell the coffee. You are too old to believe in the puerile nonsense that you yourself write. Better start reading the Bhagvad Gita. Your ancient views have no takers.

                            So desperate is Mani the moron that he now has to resort to relying on an 'Oxford' scholar, Nikita Sud and the Economist magazine to tell us, humble Indians what is wrong with us.  So let us address these matters first: Sud is an Indian who happens to be an Oxford scholar; no big deal; hundreds of thousands have passed through that much hyped institution and we in India do not need lessons from Indians who feel they have become superior whites and can therefore be patronising towards Indians.  Mani the moron was a Cambridge scholar and outside the Gandhi parivar, he is regarded as a rabid sycophant; nothing more, nothing less!  As for the Economist magazine, it was that very magazine which sought to poke its nose into India's internal affairs by urging Indians to vote for Rahul Gandhi or else face such catastrophes as communal discord.  Not much credibility there then!  Foreign scholars and foreign magazines do not have their ears to the ground particularly on poverty and cast matters.  Chaiwallas do.  A person like Modi who relied on 'bhiksha' to survive would know more about the plight of the poor than would Mani the moron who flits from one alcohol fuelled party to another, from one TV studio to another and who then pens an article here and there attacking Modi as if his attacks mattered!  An analysis of the disaster that has been the Gandhi parivar may be regarded as atonement for Mani the moron's sins but the poor fellow simply cannot be separated from his need to be a sycophant!

                            If we look at the macro level, then caste and community are major parameters deciding standard of living of Indian households. Going with the scientific approach of Pareto Analysis, at least government agencies should know that which segment has highest problems. So that they can take targeted approach. If not public, this census must be revealed to govt agencies and state governments so that they can take specific measures.

LIVE LARGE by themselves and leave us to fight on caste, communal lines. Even your's sincerely, doesn't do anything for living, yet able to live in Delhi and write blogs! Go figure!

                            Dear Mr Mani shankar,<br/><br/>
Kindly dont make a habit to speak against caste. Even Sikhism and Buddhism we can visualize casteism. It is very much visible in Muslim and Chritianity. Then why blame Hinduism. You are only giving rise to Hindutva politics. Did you forgot you yourself are a Hindu-Brahmin and you feel shame or shy to call your self Brahmin. Dont his casteism, it will only grow. Accept it, it will calm down.

                            Now, now, Mr Aiyer don't you know that's a silly question to ask the government? The BJP have far more serious issues on their hands like wondering who they should bump off next because he/she represents a threat to their grand notion of 'good governance'? Stop being such an irritant and bothering the PM as he has global issues on his mind like wondering which suit to pack for his next foreign tour.

                            Firstly we are NO longer interested in caste based system/politics. Secondly it was UPA which should have published survey findings long back, UPA just sat on the task and very little progress was made towards completion of the report.

                            What a horribly confused and convoluted mind. He begins by admitting that the Caste census was a divisive act by the British. Yet in the hands of his revered UPA was an act of great sagacity. Then in his penchant for his disgust with anything Modi he delves into an indictment by foreign reports about the difference in statistics concerning Gujarat during Modi. Poor thing forgot that he a commenting on Caste in the report just released.

                            The whole point of secular brigade is to divide Hindus and unite minorities against them.  When you give benefits based on caste consideration, the well-off in that caste pocket those benefits generation after generation.

                            Biggest reason for the caste data to have been held back is the fact that some of the more populous 'OBCs' like Jats and Yadavs are not poor anymore.

                            Rs 10 Mr Aiyar! Really? Seriously? You think 10 rupees should be the poverty line? That's where academicians go wrong. Bring practicality please...In my simple guess, typically anything below Rs 100 per day would be poor in today's world. Any layman would agree to that..so there's absolutely no need to waste time on such stupid studies, leave alone the need to publish or review such data based on impractical premise.

                            what is with MS Iyer - he thinks Modi, day and night, seven days a week! There is so much to write about. Burgeoning population, reservations that were meant to last 10 years as per Congress, corruption caused by reservations, licence raj corruption that is still with us today, another baby of Congress, fixing demand as supplies were not enough, haphazard development that sees encroachment as a normal part of life everyday leaves India looking like a disaster zone, unequal development across India, lack of water, lack of power. MS Iyer could write about any of these issues and present his solutions! Or could he. Even the Gandhis in power for 10 years did not listen to him, so why should PM Modi.

                            Sir, your party has ruled many decades. What has been your amazing contribution to the issue?? 75% of the population is still poor or distressed (as per your own writing). How has the Congress benefited the country and the population? i do not know about the poor of Gujarat. but i know of the poor of MP and Maharashtra, both states largely governed by your party, and the status is pathetic. Whatever change in the people has happened inspite of your party's governance and not due to it. <br/>
Criticizing someone is easy. doing proactive productive work is difficult. You and your party failed. So stating someone else is bad is not the solution. Come up with an alternative and we the people of India would like it. To say whatever you did in the past was amazing is not going to work. THe report card clearly shows you failed miserable. The same of the earlier is just not what is required.

                            Mr. MSA's party, the Indian National Congress coined the slogan garibi hatao some 50 years back. But even after so much money going down the drain, and most of it in the pockets of people like MSA and Robber Vadra, nothing has changed in the country for the millions of underprivileged and downtrodden. Now MSA wants to put all the blame for this sorry state of affairs on the govt. which has just come to govern. And govern they wil,l not misgovern like Mrs. Gandhi or MMS.
