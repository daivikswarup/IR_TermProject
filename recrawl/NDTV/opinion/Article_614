Headline::::Kejriwal's Protest Against Lieutenant Governor is Necessary



DateTime::::2015-05-18T15:08:00+05:30




                                The Modi government is completing one year in power at the centre, and Arvind Kejriwal is racing towards his 100 days of governance in Delhi - and if one compares both honestly, one can see the difference. Modi is all about hype and hoopla, and Arvind is about delivery, and that is the reason the BJP is worried and its Dirty Tricks Department is working overnight to discredit AAP and squeeze the government with unfair pressure. The latest example is the Lieutenant Governor's attempt to usurp the power of an elected Chief Minister and appoint an acting Chief Secretary without his consent. This is not only a violation of the constitution, but also conspiratorial.
Yes, I agree that Delhi is not a full state. The Chief Minister does not have as many powers as enjoyed by other state leaders. In the capital, the LG is not a ceremonial figurehead like other governors. Powers of Police, Law and Order and Land are directly in the hands of the LG. But that does not mean that the Chief Minister of Delhi is just a titular head and he is a subordinate to the LG. This raises certain fundamental questions which need to be understood if parliamentary democracy has to work smoothly.
1. AAP has won 67 seats and it is the duly elected government with a sovereign assembly reflecting the will of the people. Arvind Kejriwal is a constitutionally-elected Chief Minister. Now the question is, does an elected Chief Minister have right to choose a  Chief Secretary or not ? In a parliamentary democracy, it is the prerogative of the elected Chief Minister to choose his/her team for the smooth delivery of the promises made during elections. He is the face of the government, and not the Lieutenant Governor, who is appointed by the central government. And in a democracy, an appointed authority can't be given precedence over an elected constitutional body. The LG in Delhi is trying to violate this fundamental spirit of democracy and the  constitution.
2. The Lieutenant Governor has also violated the constitution. Article 239 AA (4) clearly lays down the process by which a difference of opinion between the LG and the CM is resolved:  "provided that in the case of difference of opinion between LG and his minister on any issue, the LG shall refer it to the president for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the president and pending such decision it shall be competent for the LG , in any case where the matter, in his opinion is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to take such action or to give such direction in the manner as he deems necessary. "
But this act has to be read with the transaction of business rules (TBR) 49, 50, 51, and 52, which clearly mention that the LG can't act and direct the department, bypassing the minister concerned. TBR clearly spells out the ground rule. TBR 51 talks about the presidential reference and urgency clause for immediate action by the LG, but it has to be read with TBR 52 which says - "where a direction is given by the LG IN PURSUANCE OF RULE 51, THE MINISTER CONCERNED SHALL TAKE ACTION TO GIVE EFFECT TO SUCH DIRECTION." (emphasis mine)
In this case the LG has violated the law on two counts. Firstly,  he has not sent the matter for presidential reference when there was difference of opinion between him and the Chief Minister for the appointment of the acting CS which he should have done and which is a violation of Article 239AA(4). Secondly, in case of urgency when the LG is required to act, he has violated TBR Rule 52 which unambiguously states that he can't give directions to the secretary or the department bypassing the minister  for the notification of the appointment of the acting Chief Secretary. In this case, he has given direct orders and not via the minister concerned, Manish Sisodia.
In the absence of the presidential reference, his order is otherwise also null and void. Now the question is why has the Lieutenant Governor done this? And why has his act been justified by the central Home Ministry to whom the Lieutenant Governor reports? Ideally, the central Home Minister should have reprimanded the Lieutenant Governor and set things right. Since that has not been done it clearly indicates a deep rooted conspiracy by the Modi government to destabilise the duly elected government in Delhi. In view of the above, AAP has no option but to seek an appointment with the President of India and apprise him of the situation, hoping justice will be done.
3. There is another side of the story too which makes it more dangerous. The conduct of the officer concerned who has been appointed as the acting Chief Secretary raises serious doubts. The Power Minister has written a letter to the LG which has been reported on in the press which alleged she had been putting pressure on the minister to sign a "comfort letter" addressed to Power Finance Corporation for a loan amounting to Rs. 11,000 crore to power companies. This is a kind of guarantee letter to the Corporation on behalf of the power companies including one owned by Reliance that if they default in repaying the loan,  it would be incumbent on the Delhi Government to settle the debt. The question is,  when the LG has been apprised of the matter orally many times, and finally in writing, then why is he hell-bent on appointing such an officer in violation of the constitution?
 
4. It will also be pertinent to ask a simple question - why is Mr. Najeeb Jung continuing as the LG of Delhi when all other governors appointed by the earlier UPA government have been replaced/sacked?
The matter is extremely serious and it's a question of constitutionality too. Modi is known to not forget his friends and foes. He also has a strong authoritarian streak and the way governors have been removed/ sacked and the way the LG has been allowed to behave strongly hints at contempt for the opposition. This is against the spirit of the federalism and in the long run will jeopardize the centre state relations. Today it is AAP, tomorrow it will be others. It has to be protested and stopped.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.

                            Mr Ashutosh..Simple..if you think and you believe that LG is constitutionally wrong in appointing the CS..i am sure you would know that you can approach the court instead of writing this essay..yes many agree that elected representative should have the powers so they can govern as per the mandate. But Delhi's constitution is different and you and your aap leaders were not aware of it? the problem is also that your leader is quick to accuse someone without any proof as usual..

                            Ashutosh, A former journalist like you talking and quoting points from the Constitution just to prove that you ave 67 seats and the other parties having nothing. The Chief Minister is still wasting government time by this all drama for 10 days of appointment. <br/>
I voted for AAP, but till now i am the most disappointed person in Delhi. All i have seen, heard are the dirty politics, no work and the same old rallies using the same old words. All i hear is "we have proof", I am deeply disappointed, I think so are others by putting our trust again in AAP.<br/><br/>
Does the Chief Minister of the Capital of India should have time do even think about all these things? And an educated man like you is justifying all his actions in an article. <br/>
That really casts severe doubt over the idols and people of the party.

                            First of all , the rules were not so easy for the LG to act of his own to appoint the temporary CS; his action and justification of his action is laboured- to say the least. Anything laboured in administration or in management reeks of bad intentions, because like mathematics, the rules are made to solve the problem with minimal, common sense application of principles- here `rules'. If two plus two make four, LG can't say they may also make five because an unseen `one' stands in addition. Besides, LG should know that  his behaviour of action Vis Vis his people's government should, by following best practices of democracy ought not to be authoritarian, but a follower in the most dignified ways. Once he knew there was a doubt about the person, and his government was not happy installing her as CS, he should simply not do that. LG by giving lame excuses and interpreting rules as per his convenience, has acted in most partisan manner and has put himself and his bureaucrat advisers in his office as infantry of the nexus that Asutosh, AAP (read Kejriwal) and His government have been talking about. Secondly, why the guys liker Rajiju et al are trying to make it an issue of the Lady from the North East in distress!! "A lady that too from the North East" was the most stupid clause of the statement made by someone as justifying the LG's action in her favour. Thirdly, in bureaucratic departmental inquiries against a doubtful conduct, the Inquiry officer need not prove the charge, s/he may rely upon `preponderance of probabilities' against the charged officer regarding the charge. So, the`preponderance of probabilities' have a very strong basis of viewing the moral side of a conduct. LG should have known this fact. Once his government reported the matter to him orally or in written, that that action of hers made a very strong probability of going against the tenor and manifest intentions of a non-corrupt and non-collusionist government, then applying his prudence on the matter, the LG should have avoided installing her the CS of his own government.    The lady officer should voluntaraily go on leave for a week.

                            Dear Ashutosh<br/><br/>
Is your Government so naive that anybody can recommend for a guarantee of Rs 11000 Cr from a government and the same will be provided? Is not there a process of managing the same, and does the person who has recommended that, must have given some noting on the same for due consideration by the concerned minister. Does that mean that she has been lobbying for the companies. Please declare what is the rationale of providing such guarantee..which looks like a laughable matter with AAP stating that she has the power to allow such large guarantee..Looks lie AAP is cuckooland....

To me you look sick. You need to get yourself changed otherwise do not post any article. I have been seeing your article for long but now it looks like you are sick. Get out of Kejriwal and think rationally. All you AAP guys are bringing shame to us. <br/><br/>
Kejriwal is crying like a small 5 year old baby who cries every day when he does not get even a smallest of the thing his way. I have never seen any CM in history behaving like this and you are even smaller than him, who still tries to justify him everyday with your articles. <br/><br/>
Basic thing in life is if things are not working your way then either quit the way or try out new ways to work rather than cribbing of to what you have got.<br/>
Even we struggle in multiple ways but we all do not crib and blame others.<br/><br/>
Everyone does not get the silver spoon and you will never get it in politics.<br/>
I hope you guyz new this before entering in politics. Stop cribbing and start working, start looking things with a positive attitude and you will be able to work out something. <br/><br/>
One thing i can tell you, you are a big Joker right now will all your articles.<br/>
Understand and change your attitude.

                            Asutosh Please take a deep breadth before you slam someone with wrongdoing.  You may have won seats but that does not mean you know everything and cast aspersions on someone without understanding issues. A government guarantee for a power company is not new and certainly not scandalous as you guys are making it to be. The agreement between the state and the power company dictates the price being paid to the power producer and there could be possibility in that if the government guarantees the loan the cost of borrowing would come down and that benefit passes back to the buyer.  So not always a government guarantee is a bad thing.  Also understand the ground realities - if the guarantee has to be invoked it would mean that the power company has defaulted and in most situations that would mean that they are not in a position to produce power.  So whether you give guarantee or not if they default it is the ultimate consumer who will suffer without power. So please fight your political battles behind closed doors and don't tarnish names before understanding core issues.

                            Ashutosh Bhai, so disappointing to see that the leader whom you defend so vociferously cannot not even manage the temporary posting of a bureaucrat. Tch..tch..tch..<br/>
The very fact that the Chief Secretary required the Power Minister's endorsement to proceed with guarantee for Power Companies means that she could not have delivered the same on its own. Even if her proposal didn't have merit – there are several recourses available within the government machinery. Simplest being to hold the file for ten days, by when the bureaucrat would have gone! You do not run to courts, President or public for each and every challenge that you come across. Instead, you use these opportunities to build bridges with your opponents. Alas, Kejri does not know this. He is being foolish if he aspires for a perfect world with a readily available legal recourse to all his problems, within which he would rule as a Chief Minister. If such a world existed, we could have voted for machines. <br/>
It is time Kejri, YOU and AAP executive cadre stopped complaining and rather studied "Governance 101 for Dummies" if you folks are really clueless on what to do now – every time you face a challenge. Grow up BOYS…else go back to what you are best at..Street Fight..<br/>

Looks like you have more time to write over a blog rather than working for the development/growth of Delhi and its citizens. Go get a life dude and do something constructive which ppl will respect.

                            Whether you win 67 or the entire 70, it makes no difference. There is constitution laid out and it has to be followed. Suppose for argument sake we say the single largest party manages to get say 35 or 36 seats, even  they can argue that they are an elected Govt. So these Numbers do not mater at all and people who care a hoot to the law and constituition, what do we call them.

Is the answer not obviuos... Delhi people found the others not worth it!... It is that simple. BJP and Congress were seen as unworthy parties. <br/><br/>
Even if this is a wrong decision, why not let the Delhi people make the correction in the next election. Why are these good souls hell bent to make changes on behalf of the Delhi people... <br/><br/>
If a party which only got 31% nationally can get obsolute majority and claim success to rule my country.... Why cannot a party that got 67% run the Delhi government?

                            Ashuthosh, you are Kejriwal's sychophant and so you lack total objectivity. The simple matter is with this huge mandate 67/70 you and AAP must rise from petty mindedness and show your skills in governance.

                            Either you can protest or govern,make the choice.Protest should be left for opposition.Like congress is protesting for everything at centre.Modi can't protest,he has to govern with all the hurdles created by opposition.These idiots do't know the art of governance.They started failing so created this hungama.

                            Mr Ashutosh. Couple of weeks back you wrote similar blog defending the Govt letter issued on defamation and you know exactly what happend in the Supreme Court . Whether you like it or not  Govt.  can be run on constitution basis  and . Govt can't be run with  these confrontation or steert politics.

                            People who think that they have the knowledge of everything are the biggest idiots. Gutless people only make accusations without valid supporting documents.  If the LG is wrong, go to the court of law.  Oh Ho, I just forgot, they don't have trust on the courts too.

                            Why this much fuss. It is clearly said that she is acting CS until the present CS comes back from leave which is 10 days. Why making big hype/fuss about it. CS is changed whenever CM changes almost everywhere because CMs want CS to be in their control. AAP bothering about CS makes it equal to or perhaps worse than other parties as AAP claims they are different from other political parties.

                            Now a days this become usual trend. Arvind Kejriwal does some blunder for getting attention and Ashutosh writes article here to justify. If you think so LG is wrong then please go to court and punish him on legal ground rather than misleading readers. Why are you allegating somebody without basis ? Come on be a man. If you says that LG doesn't allows you to fulfill your promise then it is utter non sense. How LG prevents you to fulfill your promise ? Can you provide single instance ? It is AAP party who doesn't want to fulfill the promise and finding scape goat in LG. No Lokpal no swaraj no anna and even no development. This appointment is for 10 days. That doesn't affects AAP govt. Still like child locking office door and crying foul. Ashutosh and co. at least act like man.

                            Democratic institutions should be strengthened and not weakened. Writer knows that the ongoing war has involved constitutional edifices.In the circumstances,inspiring protests which are directed against Constitutional authorities shall disturb the foundations of democracy.

                            Wisdom lies in pooling best of legal brains and find out a solution of this crisis.If there is will,this can be done,otherwise small errors lead to biggest stalemates. A few errors By Indira Gandhi had led to imposition of Emergency in the country.. Let wisdom prevail on every stakeholder in this ongoing problem.

                            Let it be examined if the LG has violated any rule whereas he was supposed to send a matter of difference for Presidential reference.This interpretation again can open a Pandora's box since many times it has been argued<br/>
that the President is supposed to act on the advice of Council of Ministers.Anyway,it is for Constitutional experts<br/>
to interpret.

                            I think the understanding of this person and some other Chamchas of the CM is to get to the Rajya Sabha and hence they will continue to blindly support their party &amp; govt chief irrespective of the fact how this impacts the public at large......

                            Come on , Ashutosh. Don't disguise your incompetence or unwillingness or both to govern in adopting needless confrontational attitude with LG so as to divert people's attention from your governance and  and collect some sympathy in turn. You'll do well to ponder over the following points :<br/>
(i) Is it right for you to indulge in public character assassination of a lady officer (for that anyone) without giving her the opportunity to defend herself publicly ? <br/>
(ii) If at all is she guilty, then why shouldn't you action against her?<br/>
(iii) If the lady officer is said to be looking not above aboard, why aren't the same yardstick be followed in case your law minister who has been , prima facie, found guilty by Bar Council, a constitutional body?<br/>
(iv)Further , isn't it childish to adopt antics like locking out officers or issuing orders to prevent officers from functioning ? Governing is a serious business.<br/><br/>
Considering the recent past of AAP, where any ego clash of Arvind kejriwal with anyone is sought to be portrayed as a 'victimisation'.<br/>
It might have paid you in the past, but it cannot continue to pay you. The people see through the these tactics pretty fast. It is the propriety which lasts and it was the propriety plank on which you won the election  <br/>
