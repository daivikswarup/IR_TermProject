Headline::::When Mayawati Took On Smriti Irani In Parliament



DateTime::::2016-02-28T13:38:00+05:30




                                Was it drama, ideological fight or a clash of cultures? What was it that created such a sensation and so many media headlines? Both are feisty politicians with very strong heads on their shoulders. Both are stubborn. Both are extremely successful. Mayawati, the five-time Chief Minister of UP, assumed the mantle at a very tender political age of 35 years. Smriti Irani became a cabinet minister at 38, reason for much heart burn in her own party. Even before she entered politics she was a national icon for many middle class bahus and brides-to-be.
The battle of these two extremely ambitious women was the talk of town this week when they clashed with each other in parliament. Mayawati started the assault. The BJP had planned to hijack the agenda of the house with the JNU issue when Mayawati ambushed it with her Dalit agenda. She raised the issue of Rohith Vemula and thundered that "ever since the BJP has come to power, it has tried to impose the RSS ideology". Her MPs chanted - "Dalit virodhi sarkaar nahin chalegi (Anti-Dalit government won't survive"). Mayawati wanted Smriti Irani's head. She demanded that she should be sacked. Ms. Irani was hysterical. Like a good actress, she tried to emotionalise Rohith Vemula's suicide - "Come and take my head if you want" was her retort.
And, immediately, Smriti Irani was dubbed a drama queen by her opponents and terrific speaker by her supporters in the party and some outside. Even those who had been critical of her handling of the Rohith issue were praising her on social media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted her full speech, a public pat on the back. She was bold and furious. Some said the speech showed the birth of a new top-level leader in the BJP.
But Mayawati was more strategic. She did not shout. She is known to not speak much. She rarely interacts with the media and neither does she say much in the House. But she did not want to miss this opportunity. This is about a Dalit student. She wanted to convey the message that the BJP is not pro-Dalit despite an attempt to usurp Baba Saheb Ambedkar this year by none other than Prime Minister Modi.
Mayawati knows well that in the 2014 parliamentary elections, Modi and the BJP successfully lured Dalits to vote for them. Mayawati and her BSP drew a blank and the BJP romped home with 71 seats in UP, where the state elections are a year away. And after a bad loss in Delhi and Bihar, UP will be very crucial for Modi himself and for the BJP as well. It is this battle which will settle the question as to if Modi is still the darling of the masses or if 2014 was just a bubble. Mayawati is also fighting for her survival. She has been virtually written off by political pundits after the Lok Sabha elections. And the country has not heard about her or from her in the recent past. With an aggressive BJP, Mayawati has to send a very strong signal to her core constituency and voters of UP at large that she is still relevant and ready to fight. This was the golden moment. She seized it well.
The BJP is aware that Rohith's suicide has snowballed into a major controversy. The message that has gone to the Dalit community is that two central ministers - Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani - have been, directly or indirectly linked to his death, and hence, the demand for their sacking.
The RSS has been trying hard to assimilate the Dalits into its Hindutva project but the Rohith issue has come as a great jolt and reports from the ground are not very encouraging. There is anger among the community against the BJP/RSS. To begin with, the BJP wanted to avoid the debate on Rohith in parliament. Political pundits are of the opinion that the BJP deliberately fuelled the JNU debate to distract attention from Rohith's death.
The debate on Nationalism has caught the imagination of the country. Smriti Irani was determined to combine both the issues and sidetrack Rohith, but Mayawati did not let that happen. Mayawati's act was a disruption, Irani's was to damage-control. One was calculative, the other was emotional. One is battle-hardened, the other a greenhorn. A comparison would be lopsided but the "other" fought well with limited success. Neither of them emerged victorious.
Mayawati is a product of the most understated but most brilliant revolution this country has ever seen. Dalits have always been treated most inhumanly in our culture. The Constitution gave them political equality but political power eluded them till the early 90s. Kanshi Ram did the most magnificent political experiment in UP, aroused Dalit consciousness to a level that they craved power for themselves, and formed the first Dalit government which was unthinkable till a few years ago. Mayawati was his most loyal pupil.
But if she did not get respect, Mayawati has no one to blame but herself because of her greed for money and the corruption that she spawned. The BJP always believed that it was the emergence of this Dalit class which stopped the march of Hindutva. The Dalit assertion in UP was so powerful that after the Babri demolition, the BJP could not attain a majority on its own and since then has been out of power in the state except for once.
In the House, Smriti Irani's anger reflects that angst of the RSS. She challenged people to name her caste, but she forgot that she represents a political party and an ideological force which in its moorings is upper caste, and the Dalits call them Manuvadi, followers of Manusmriti, which is essentially the Das Capital of the Brahmanical order perpetuated for thousands of years in our society.
This is a war and it will accentuate further. There will be more such battles. The two cultures will further clash. Shrillness and shouting will not help, this has to be understood. Drama can bring applause once, may be twice, but reality will soon dawn. And reality is far more cruel.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It seems the excellent performance of Smriti Irani has forced the entire opposition to counter her in parliament and outside. It is an indication of BJP's  leadership where even a first minister and a  relatively young person is able to tackle the onslaught of opposition whose ranks have veteran and experienced MP's in its rank.

                            Yes. Mayawati is a shrewd, calculative, opportunistic politician. But Smriti is not. She is very emotional, probably artists tend to be so. So while Smriti's speech struck a chord almost instantly, Mayawati's will hardly be ever remembered. No wonder, the media didn't put any energy dissecting Mayawati but Smriti's popular speech has come under so much media scrutiny.<br/><br/>
Rightly spoken by the author - Smriti is still a greenhorn. Unfortunately, the media had always been baying for her blood. So she needs to keep her emotions under check and be extra careful with her interpretations of police reports next time over.

                            Only solution for Dalits to escape persecution from upper caste is to convert to Islam, where you can enter mosques and pray shoulder to shoulder with your brothers in rows without any discrimination.

                            Mayavathi, obviously, believes that no judge is impartial. Therefore, whenever there is a case involving a Dalit  the judge must be a Dalit, if it involves jats, he/she should be a Jat and if it involves AAP party supporter, it should be the one endorsed by Arvind Kejrival. But, people want to know, if Mayavathi becomes the CM, only she should be the judge and decide tthe case.

                            AAshutosh, when will guys start focusing on Delhi. The way you and kejri are turning into trash will soon make it possible that your own broom will throw you in dustbins. Delhi made mistake by choosing congress 3 times. And see how they finished. We wont make the same mistake next time and remove your corrupt and drama party from Delhi.

                            Smriti irani did a great job ! Can't people see why ashutosh (AAP party) and Mohd. sidiqui would say what they are saying !! mayawati government saw a spate of corruption which baffles me why these people were quite then ! Not to mention wasting people's money in self patronizing statues of worthless use now or in the future ! people need to grow up if they want see some advancement of this country beyond caste and creed ! Smriti is someone doing good work for the country

                            So all the political parties have united against BJP.  I dont think Mayawati and Smriti Irani can be compared also! Atleast Smriti Irani has some skills of acting Mayawati is corrupt and has taken it to unthinkable heights. She pays tax of 25 Crs to 30 Crs yearly. And this is for declared income. Imagine how much undeclared money she has. Is this how much a CM makes. The nation is watching and i hope BJP comes to power again in the next term. Please let us not politically play more on castes and religion. Its an urge to every political party. Why cant u think about India first and then about your seat and votebanks.

                            बी.ए. पास करने के बाद चन्द्रप्रकाश को एक टयूशन करने के सिवा और कुछ न सूझा। उसकी माता पहले ही मर चुकी थी, इसी साल पिता का भी देहान्त हो गया और प्रकाश जीवन के जो मधुर स्वप्न देखा करता था, वे सब धूल में मिल गये। पिता ऊँचे ओहदे पर थे, उनकी कोशिश से चन्द्रप्रकाश को कोई अच्छी जगह मिलने की पूरी आशा थी; पर वे सब मनसूबे धरे रह गये और अब गुजर-बसर के लिए वही 30) महीने की टयूशन रह गई। पिता ने कुछ सम्पत्ति भी न छोड़ी, उलटे वधू का बोझ और सिर पर लाद दिया और स्त्री भी मिली, तो पढ़ी-लिखी, शौकीन, जबान की तेज जिसे मोटा खाने और मोटा पहनने से मर जाना कबूल था। चन्द्रप्रकाश को 30) की नौकरी करते शर्म तो आयी; लेकिन ठाकुर साहब ने रहने का स्थान देकर उसके आँसू पोंछ दिये। यह मकान ठाकुर साहब के मकान से बिलकुल मिला हुआ था पक्का, हवादार, साफ-सुथरा और जरूरी सामान से लैस। ऐसा मकान 20) से कम पर न मिलता, काम केवल दो घंटे का। लड़का था तो लगभग उन्हीं की उम्र का; पर बड़ा कुन्दजेहन, कामचोर। अभी नवें दरजे में पढ़ता था। सबसे बड़ी बात यह कि ठाकुर और ठाकुराइन दोनों प्रकाश का बहुत आदर करते थे, बल्कि उसे लड़का ही समझते थे। वह नौकर नहीं, घर का आदमी था और घर के हर एक मामले में उसकी सलाह ली जाती थी। ठाकुर साहब अँगरेजी नहीं जानते थे। उनकी समझ में अँगरेजीदाँ लौंडा भी उनसे ज्यादा बुद्धिमान, चतुर और तजरबेकार था।

                            In this country there are various strains of thought that have learnt to co-exist over the years-the left, the right the liberal and more recently, the Dalit. What BJP has achieved with the Rohit Vemula and JNU incident is to have the the remaining three line up against the Hindu right in one stroke. By itself it wouldn't have been so bad had it used fair means to do so. But unfortunately it is perceived to have used some very unfair and heavy handed tactics in both these cases. Clearly both within the country and outside they have lost the battle of perception. Whether or not this will cost them politically remains to be seen. Last time they tried an ideological stunt ie Babri Masjid they lost heavily. Thereafter they adopted the agenda of "India Shining" under PM Vajpayee and stayed away from ideology for most of his tenure. Its hard to say whether India has changed enough to be swayed by ideology this time around.

                            The only good thing resulted out of this H. R. D. Minister that she has given reason to all apposition parties to get united. For Smriti Irani offence is best form of defense. It is up to analysts to conclude how much she succeeded in defending the undefendable . Mrs. Irani's argument lacked substance and mere theatric could not make up the deficit. Nation is witnessing unprecedented practice of discrimination against suppressed .Privilege motion against the minister is underway. Toadies can only do best what they reputed for I. e. make cluttering sound. But  who cares for a frog in the well (ignorant).
