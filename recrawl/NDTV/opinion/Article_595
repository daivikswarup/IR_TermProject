Headline::::Bihar Rejects Amit Shah's High-Pitched Campaign



DateTime::::2015-11-08T20:17:00+05:30




                                The results of the Bihar Assembly election are not only surprising but also come as a huge jolt to the BJP. It reconfirms yet again that psephology in India remains a highly inexact science, and opinion (and even exit) polls are unable to accurately gauge voters' mood. Predictions went horribly wrong in the Delhi Assembly elections last year; no pollster had a clue about the scale of newbie Aam Aadmi Party's victory. 
Arguably, some Opinion/Exit polls were broadly right for the Lok Sabha election of 2014, maybe because the Modi wave was too huge to miss. Even ordinary people were convinced that Narendra Modi was heading for a landslide win; pollsters merely reaffirmed public sentiment. Looking at the size of the victory of the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar, it is strange that every informed opinion declared it "too close to call" till Saturday - a day before the counting of votes. Those who were bold enough to predict the outcome either gave a narrow lead to the Grand Alliance (GA) or declared an edge for the BJP-led NDA. 
It seems that the low-key GA campaign and its decision to project soft-spoken Nitish Kumar as the Chief Ministerial candidate did the trick, with voters rejecting the high-pitched BJP campaign crafted by party president Amit Shah. The BJP may not be guilty of the entire multitude of sins its critics have thrust on it. Certainly, the communalisation charge volubly levelled against it is quite untrue. Also the award-wapsi movement spearheaded by politically motivated artists and intellectuals found no resonance in Bihar  despite the efforts made by the agitation's sponsors.
But ultimately Bihar demonstrated that it is far from rejecting caste as its main political currency. When its electorate gave a resounding 30-seats-to-10 victory to Prime Minister Modi barely 18 months ago, there was a glimmer of hope that Bihar had risen above its defining political paradigm, namely caste. Probably, for once, the electorate had pushed caste to the backburner and believed in Modi's all-encompassing development plank. But when voting for a government in the state, caste reared its ubiquitous head. Although the sectoral break-up of voting patterns are yet to be computed satisfactorily, conventional wisdom that upper castes and a section of Dalits have voted BJP, while the dominant middle castes like Yadavs and Kurmis, along with Muslims, have opted for the GA, appears to have been reinforced.
It is an established fact that when casteism determines voting intentions in North Indian States, the BJP ends up as the main loser. And in the attempt to match caste with caste, BJP strategists erred in their calculations.
The BJP did make an effort to highlight its supra-caste agenda by pushing Prime Minister Modi as its principal campaigner along with its national president Amit Shah. But Bihari sub-national pride did not reconcile itself to the party not projecting local leaders - the Bahari versus Bihari slogan, craftily coined by the Lalu-Nitish duo, seemed to receive traction as the campaign progressed. 
In the process of caste reasserting itself, we are faced with a regrettable situation in which Lalu Yadav's party has won more seats than Nitish Kumar's JDU. This does not augur well for the State's governance. Much as Lalu Yadav and his acolytes may aver that Nitish Kumar is their declared choice for Chief Minister, it is obvious that the remote control of the next government will rest in the RJD chief's hands. Apart from extracting his own pound of flesh by imposing one of his sons as Deputy Chief Minister despite their political and administrative inexperience, Lalu Yadav is certain to push his other agendas with vehemence. 
If Nitish was able to build his image as a Vikas Purush (champion of development) and pursue restoration of law and order and bijli-sadak-pani (roads-water-electrcity) issues during his earlier stint in power, it was mainly because during his alliance with BJP, he was left alone to govern. It will be very difficult to repeat this feat by him  with RJD holding the key to his government's stability.
As in real-life dramas, elections in India are contested in a hero-villain syndrome. Whichever party is able to portray its opponent as a villain, has a natural advantage. However the Bihar poll was fought without a villain in the picture. For the BJP, its regular villain, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, was only a bit player, almost without a speaking role in the long-running drama. By opting for a back seat, Lalu ensured he did not fit that role either. And Nitish, with the fully deserved epithet "Susashan Babu" (good governance leader) could not have been acceptable to the people as the villain. So it ended up as a contest between two heroes - Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar. The campaign was devoid of any rhetoric against the incumbent Chief Minister, a rarity in Indian elections.
It must also be borne in mind that the BJP had never emerged as the leading political force in caste-dominated Bihar. Thus it tried to stitch up alliances with marginal players like Upendra Kushwaha and Jitan Ram Manjhi, the extent of whose own political support was questionable. In order to become a viable alternative to the Nitish-Lalu combine, the BJP needs to assiduously build its base, overcoming the formidable challenge of caste alliances which tend to work against the BJP's ideological core. In this context, the need to cultivate a powerful local leadership cannot be overstated.
The results will pose a larger problem for Prime Minister Modi, already hamstrung by the Opposition's strength in the Rajya Sabha. A more politically inclusive approach towards Opposition parties is what the doctor will definitely prescribe.(Dr. Chandan Mitra is a journalist, currently Editor of The Pioneer Group of Publications.

                            Mr. Mitra i feel you have very conveniently forgotten that for a state to give modi a thumping majority 16 months back and a nothing now is only because of LACK OF COHERENT POLICIES AND NO ACTION ON GROUND. Caste has got no role in todays pilitics , be it bihar or tamilnadu

                            Are we to believe that the BJP did not take the caste calculations into account at all? I remember one senior BJP leader bragging about how each assembly constituency had been broken into wards and how the caste-mix was being managed at the ward level by assigning leader of the appropriate castes, etc. I am sure caste must have played  a key role in the electioneering, but nobody is holier than the rest. Basically, Bihar's voters did not see a positive difference in their lives brought about by the new NDA government that could have been substantive enough to have countered the other factors including caste. Although Sushil Modi may be slightly relatively better placed, the rest of the NDA leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi, Ram Vilas Paswan, Ravi Shanker Pershad are dwarfs when compared with Nithish in terms of the Goodwill enjoyed among the masses.

                            More than that infact. It was high pitched communal, full of hatred, sarcasm &amp; mockery campaign. This is the true picture of RSS BJP and their politics. This is again inform people that RSS did not participate in independence movement. They were allied with British to fail Gandhi &amp;.Congress along with Jinnah who was implementing their two nation theory. That is why they like Pakistan. They always bring the religious bitterness during elections.BJP is primarily corrupt &amp; communal. Today on Advani birthday who brought religious hatred from Pakistan to India &amp; made Modi kind of arrogant mindsets, great that BJP's Pakistani politicsgot defeated today. An appeal to all to revive Congress at national level.

                            Caste equation has overtly been criticized by those who holds the hegemony(Bania &amp; Brahmans) who themselves are not able to hold the fort by their caste numbers but enigmatically holding it, be it cabinets berths or their numbers in various elected and selected bodies. It seems like that reservation has become the ceiling point and by invoking the name of religion these Banias and Brahmans have managed a huge number in current Lok Sabha. Its a wake up call from Bihar which will demolish their plans. <br/>

BJP is so arrogant that they stuckk to gajendra chauhan and let FTII go to the dogs, and just arrogantly crushed students. No wonder, BJP is limited to another one term govt. Modi has to learn humility, and never attack his predecessiors when abroad. Never crush a small neighbour like Nepal, as a regional bully.  Sadly this govt is absolutely inept and clueless.

                            Dear Chandan,<br/><br/>
It is funny that when you introspect, you again blame it on people, by telling that they could not rise above caste politics. Your campaigning had the same problem, when your party talked about Pakistan. I think challenging the intellect of voters is a folly. You dont make talk which implies that the voters have something in common with Pakistanis. The worst part is you dont accept your follies. <br/>
I ll give you free advice. Ditch Modi and Amit Shah in any state elections bar Gujarat. Go to ground level. Involve those party workers who have been with BJP for last 15 years. Pick candidates from those ground level workers. You will easily win almost any state election. The moment you start ignoring those BJP workers and bring Amit Shah's people to the state for elections, you are bound to lose.<br/><br/>
This happened in Delhi. Same happened in Bihar.<br/><br/>
Advice#2<br/>
Never rely your campaign on hate politics. Ridiculing opponents and that too from the mouth of someone holding the PMO is cheap and shameful. This is bound to kick you back. You called Kejriwal a naxalite. He threw you out. You called Congress and JDU all kinds of names. Bihar rejected you.<br/><br/>
Modi is fast making name like Rahul baba by losing wherever he does extensive campaign. Development development development will start when you learn to leave the tail of cow.

                            Irony # 1 of Bihar_BJP - Having selflessly helped Nitish build his brand between 2005-2013 it had no product to market in 2015.<br/>
Irony # 2 of Bihar_BJP - Enabling regressive Lalu to sail to the political shore on the development plank it had carved for Nitish Kumar.<br/>
It's poetic Justice when Lalu's jungle instincts force Nitish to ditch the development agenda he had stolen from Bihar_BJP.

                            Low level of verbal attack by non other than PM and BJP President ( e.g. jungle raj and bursting of crackers at Pakistan) can only attract clap from audience attending the electoral meeting.  Such applaud don't convert in to vote always. We have seen the attacked on Kejriwal in Delhi (PM remarks as Naxal)  and similar attacked at Bihar this time. BJP should learn to speak in a language which will not annoyed the citizen in general.

Your entire opinion is based on an assumption that if BJP wins its because of development and when it loses its because of caste....<br/><br/>
keep up with this thought and believe me more and more states will go the Bihar way for the BJP.....

As if in the absence of caste factors BJP would have won easily because of Modi. What happened in Delhi then? Standard procedure for BJP now - protect the PM and blame everyone and everything else and continue with the arrogance.

                            I agree that BJP has lost due to its own arrogance. If Modi talked only and only about development in his rallies ,just like he sold dres in the LS election probably it could have been a different story. Also , let us agree that the good work done by Nitish over the last 10 years would be soon undone , now that the remote is with Lalu. Long story cut short , in due course Nitish will have to choose between development of Bihar and  Lalu. God bless Bihar

                            Good analysis. The caste factor is a given in Bihar. But the BJP could have done far better by emphasizing the development agenda rather than caste and religion. Nitish Kumar won mainly on his proven record of good work, while Laloo has contributed the caste factor. Good lesson for the BJP. The PM  should not campaign too much in state elections. Secondly the BJP requires a new chief who encourages local talent. Not involving locals has proved disastrous in both Delhi and Bihar.

                            bjp urgently needs to move persons from the east to prominent positions at the national level. right now the positions have a heavy north and west tilt. when the ordinary voter looks at the party and sees not one face representing him, they do not feel the party as their own.<br/><br/>
i understand that most of bjp wins have come from north and west and certainly funding mainly from west so it is natural to have most leadership from there too. but if you have to win east (and may be it holds true for south too), you have to invest first. and then hope to reap later.

                            The reason BJP lost in Bihar was that it became too defensive. Almost all political parties wanted it, even some of its own partners.<br/>
1. Had they put a CM candidate much earlier, it would have been much different. PM cannot come to address a state's problems every now and then. BJP had Sushil Modi to project.<br/>
2. A prime minister does not have the time and cannot put the effort to galvanize masses, which a local hero can do.<br/>
3. Nitish played the victim card (just like Kejriwal). His strategists were waiting the BJP to do single mistake. The DNA remark was very small thing, yet Nitish used it.<br/>
4. Nitish had wrong people on his side, he had all people with bad image/reputation except he himself. This should been a big gain for BJP.<br/>
5. People like plain honesty, BJP had to gain a lot from the Nitish back stabbing. BJP slept for 1 year since its election.<br/>
6. BJP had the resources and mood to win. It had to put its own house in order, which it did not...Also too many resources leaves you confused.<br/>
7. Lastly, people are highly emotional, otherwise how could they re-elect Lalu.<br/>
So play natural...

Firstly, to leave the country in Modis's hands and to leave the party in Shah's hands exclusively shows that the bJP does not believe that it has any depth. The two man band is 'in your face' 24 hours of the day in Bihar with nobody else having a chance. The arrogance of this duo was there for everyone to see. India may have its poor electorate but they are not dumb. Bihar has shown why it created Nalanda University so many centuries ago... Biharis are deep!

so Mr Mitra, even if the voter in Bihar votes on caste - you cannot deny that even NDA asked for votes on caste and even religion. so kindly keep this patronising introspection to yourself

It is not the question of Modi or Amit shah. The Bihar folks wanted to see who will be their CM. They have already elected Modi as PM. And they did not see anyone from BJP.projected as the cm  so they went back to a known person Nitish.

                            In LS 2014, Modi was a strong leader capable to become PM based on his track record as CM for 15 years in Gujarat.<br/><br/>
Same situation worked for Nitish. We have to agree he has tremendous goodwill in Bihar as a clean, efficient CM. Of course, caste factors worked too and yes minorities voted against Modi which was probably expected. Nitsh had covered the crucial bases - efficient CM image &amp; caste factors.<br/><br/>
BJP paid heavily by relying too much on Modi. Bihar voted for him to be PM and if elections for LS were held today they would still vote for Modi. BJP paid by not projecting a strong CM candidate. Moral of the story: Either go in for allies in states or develop strong state level leaders. Problem is if you work with strong allies, it will be very difficult to develop your own strong state level leaders and if you want state level leaders it will take years before the next generation state leaders are ready. If Modi wants to develop India fast till 2019 to win a second mandate then he has to be ready to work with allies - yes they will arm twist but at least they can't do that in the centre till 2019!

Modi should focus on economic development in India. There is a huge NPAs in PSU banks, Infra companies were swimming in debt. No projects from Govt for Infra companies. Then how these debt ridden companies can pay the high interest rate.<br/>
In 18 months Modi has not done any positive work. Modi is busy campaigning for Maharastra election, Delhi Election, Chattisgarh and Haryana election and half time outside India. <br/>
Did he ever gone through books of PSU banks and Infra and Power producing companies in India.<br/>
First of all Make In India cannot take off by keeping the infra and power companies under red.<br/>
Modi has to grow up.. Looks like Modi is missing the opportunity of huge mandate given by the people. <br/>

After Modi won, the idea should have been development and enhancement of people's lives.  Rather, giving the option  of resigning to someone who has administered the state efficiently seemed the wrong direction to go. For our country to develop, funds have to be allocated for development despite the fact that state govt may not be the same party in power at the center.  This would ensure uniform development overall. My thought is that if the center had not disturbed the status quo, albeit temporarily, and allocated funds for Bihar, they would have won hands down.

                            And the Brahmin speaketh! How silly to blame that Biharis vote on caste lines. Mr Mitra be reminded that Biharis are politically more mature and show much better understanding then others who march with likes of Kher in support of the Communal forces.Pseudo intellectuals like you who are willing to behave like ostrich for a Rajya Sabha seat.

Since Modi has lost, Bihar will be crime free and TOLERANT (Sarcasm is 100% intentional)

                            BJP did nothing in last 16 months, apart from lip servicing and counter arguing "why you not act when Congress did the same thing in 200 BC". Mandate is clear " Perform or perish "

                            ow it is high time for Modi ji to listen his conscience rather than party President or RSS/BHP etc..We understand that he is looking beyond 5 years of his tenure and survival of this country in our own assets.But one must not forget that if you can not please your family at home then there is no point of pleasing the outside world.He should have been vocal about the hot topic of intolerance because somehow opposition had played a smart game over this sensitive issue..I am not saying that in last 15 years we have never seen any intolerance but one need to keep happy their oppositions too..Well,ahead of Assam's election hope BJP will change their strategy.

                            If development is done by compramising the communal harmony, then will creat ghost cities and not smart cities, so pls dont spoil bjp image that can never come to picture in next decade, india is made of one gujarat. We hope new bjp will take lesson from old bjp to run country and gujarat can. Fringe element has to control

                            Useless commentary trying to take away all blame from BJPs flawed communal strategy and blaming it on Bihar's caste ism. Reality is that Mr Modi now needs to act and show some results on the ground than just talk and look the other way when his rightist friends are creating havoc. If he is for development, it should start showing as it's been 1.5 years that he has been in power. But all he has done is just tour the world and make speeches.

                            MR Chandan Mitra, The people of india did not know very well Mr Modi and gave him a chance based on his big promises and big talks; particularly people tend to believe the slogan of 'Sab ka saat sab ka vikas'! but where is the Vikas and big promises?? had there not been down surge in the global oil process the inflation would have been far higher. And where is sab ka saat? BJP has created an atmosphere of polarization, divide and fear in the whole country, all the events that are happen now in the country are a reflection of the extent of damage BJP Govt lead by Mr Modi is doing to the fabric of this nation. The Bihar results now are a clear proof that Mr Modi has lost credibility. So, any attempt for cover-up would remain a cover-up and you can not justify anything. Hope Mr Modi and BJP learns a lesson from this and do corrections in the right sense, otherwise, BJP shall be washed out completely in next general elections. If general elections have to happen now, it would be hard for the BJP to get even 120 to 130 seats; people in general are so badly fed-up of their politics, policies, intentions, tactics and inactions.

                            Mr Mitra, pls accept defeat graciously.....Don't say you lost because the voters of Bihar gave caste the importance. At the moment if you contest any election elsewhere is the country you will see same results.....U cannot keep on projecting Modi to win elections, you need to invest in local issue and develop credible local leaders. If you don't learn you are doomed.

                            Chandan seems to have missed the point and in denial, where if the BJP is voted then it is for developement and if it is voted out then it is casteism.Thats the narrative which seems to have a tinge of arrogance to say the least.Its an oversimplification and does not make any attempt to understand the Indian Psyche.<br/>
India is a complex nation with layers of identities and any attempt at stratification is bound to boomrang at some point.It has its root in our Past experiences as a People and expections of the future.People today want to cut off from the not so glorious side of our past and move on.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately all Political parties derive mileage over exploting exactly those same insecurities and BJP has been no differant in that context.The National Parties have an added responsibility to maintain decorum and Prudence &amp; stick to a common minimum agenda of Growth and Development instead of trying fish in already muddied waters.The New Indian is awaiting for the much promised Change.<br/>
We have seen the Delhi mandate, where even if People knew that though AK is no magician, they want to try every other option available to MOVE ON.Whether our Political parties understand the subtext of the People aspirations is anybody's guess.

                            Chandan Mitra - with the drubbing you guys got, hopefully you would've got you to understand key reasons for your defeat soon enough. Your article is disappointing, very disappointing as I expect you to be thoroughly objective and this seemingly is a tough ask......this leads me to believe that you too are one of the intellectuals who come from the Anupam Kher (Conspiracy) School of thought! What a shame, you guys just seem to get it.

                            c'mon chandan, stop getting into complicated contortions in trying to obfuscate the simple fact that Bihar has unequivocally &amp; quite comprehensively rejected the rabid &amp; abusive communal agenda driven by none other than the PM.  Here's a simpler option, i.e. take a leaf out of jailtly's book and position this as a "manufactured verdict"......then no accountability has to be fixed and the massively embarrassing truth (the Bihar electorate has decisively voted against rabid communal-fascism) can be brushed under the carpet......

                            Mr Mitra - after the victory in LS elections I think two things happened (a) Modi-shah combine became very arrogant. They thought perhaps that it's a mandate to rule when it was a mandate to serve. (b) given what happened to Congress they felt that they have no opposition or critics even within the party. The fact that you have written an article so fast on Amit Shah factor shows these voices may have been there but we're not allowed to be vocal. <br/><br/>
Delhi and now Bihar... I think there are again few reasons for it. Modi government is being judged based on the hype created during the elections.. As if he will take office and all problems will be solved. So (a) there is generally a feeling that the government has not delivered. (b) Modi seems to have taken a leaf out of Manmohan Singh's form of communication. His silence on stray incidence made it seem that he is deliberately keeping quiet and it had his tacit support. Please see the clock incident in USA - Obama spoke about it immediately. He had nothing to do with it but he intervened. If he hadn't, it would seem that such things are acceptable in USA. Modi has similar responsibility. Congress is still in chaos - they are celebrating winning 20 odd seats in Bihar - such is their condition now. Modi still has the chance to make it right. He has a historical mandate. Hope he honors it.
