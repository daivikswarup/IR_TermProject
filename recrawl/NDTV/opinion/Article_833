Headline::::My Latest Exchange With Modi-ji About Clean India



DateTime::::2015-09-16T13:46:00+05:30




                                As conversations go, it wasn't a lengthy one, but fleeting encounters with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the kind of functions we meet in, rarely permit lengthy discussion. At the end of his lunch for the visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister, Mr Modi asked me, "Swachh Bharat kaisa chal raha hai? (how is the Clean India mission progressing?)" I replied that though it had raised awareness, action on the ground was lacking and he would need to provide much more Central funding. "Karoonga," he responded. "Karoonga (will do)."
I hope he does. Because what I said in those brief words goes to the heart of the problems with Mr Modi's much-vaunted Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
A clean India would benefit all of us, and I had been pleased last year, at some political cost to myself, to support the Prime Minister's initiative when he asked me to be one of its original nine Ambassadors. At the same time, as I also said in accepting his invitation, I am not a fan of tokenism, and I was worried the campaign would descend to symbolic photo opportunities for grandees who would pick up a broom for the cameras on Gandhi Jayanti, and never touch a broom again till the cameras came back the next October 2nd. Clean India is a great campaign idea, the kind of agenda-setting our Prime Minister excels at, but the real challenge, as I said then, will be to sustain it beyond a week of photo ops.
I frankly do not believe this has happened yet. The photo-ops and speeches have continued, and the original nine Swachh Bharat Ambassadors have become over a hundred, with state-level celebrities being added to the national figures chosen by the PM. But India is no cleaner than it was when Mr Modi first announced his scheme.
This is not surprising. As an Opposition MP I have had numerous occasions to point out the gap between the Prime Minister's rhetoric on a number of issues and the reality on the ground. This is a government where ideas are rarely matched by implementation. A central part of the problem, glaringly apparent in the case of Swachh Bharat, is the lack of adequate funding, commensurate with the announced objectives. As with so much else this Government has announced, there is no realistic budget, no credible plan of action, no implementation capacity. Just slogans, photo-ops, breaking news.
When Mr Modi announced his Abhiyan (mission) he talked about setting up a "Swachh Bharat Kosh," which would benefit from vast amounts of resources to scale up solutions to the problem. There is no sign of such a treasure-chest. Instead, the publicity budget for the programme has gone up by a factor of five, while the actual sanitation budget of the government is lower than that of the UPA's Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan.
It is not just that the government needs money to actually build the toilets, install the dustbins, and improve the drainage facilities it is supposed to establish. It also needs money to ensure that there is water in the toilets it builds, so the toilets are worth using. Studies suggest that most of the toilets built since Mr Modi announced his scheme are unused or unusable because they have no water to flush or clean them.
That's not all. If you clean up a street, or a park, or a beach (as I did), you need to create viable alternative places for dumping the garbage and waste that people have got used to dumping on the street, park or beach. If you don't create those alternatives, people will dump their garbage once again in the place you've just cleaned up. Those alternative places should incorporate comprehensive waste management systems, from collection to processing, perhaps conversion to biogas or other products. A clean-up, in other words, can't be an end in itself, but a mere first step in a comprehensive effort to improve public sanitation. This simply hasn't happened under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
After fulfilling my cleaning drive last October, I wrote to the Prime Minister about why his government needed to do more to fulfil the objectives of Swachh Bharat. I took the example of the Parvathy Puthenaar Canal in Thiruvananthapuram, a once-beautifully-flowing water body where boats plied, people swam and even drank the water from, till the 1930s or 40s. Now, however, the canal is choked with garbage, sewage and weeds; the idea of stepping into it, let along swimming in it, is unthinkable. I pointed out that the canal could be cleaned, at considerable cost. But if it was not to become a sewage dump again, steps would have to be taken to construct effective sewage systems for the people living on both sides of the canal, so their effluents didn't flow into it; waste disposal systems would have to be created so they didn't have to throw their garbage into the water. Otherwise the crores spent cleaning it would prove a total waste.
But this would require a mammoth effort, which an MP or even a local government would never be able to afford. It would need central funding, the kind of thing that perhaps a Swachh Bharat Kosh - or even a larger NDA sanitation budget - could have financed. It was a classic example of the kind of substance that needed to lie beyond the slogans of Swachh Bharat.
Mr Modi's response? The PM still hasn't even acknowledged my letter, let alone replied to it. The detailed project proposal prepared by the District Collector is presumably gathering dust somewhere in the Prime Minister's Office. Meanwhile, the canal remains choked up and filthy. And the Swachh Bharat photo-ops go on.
I don't mean to imply that money is everything. There's also citizen involvement. When I cleaned up a section of Vizhinjam beach in my constituency, I involved the local community as volunteers, because as the local residents, they were the obvious stakeholders in the exercise, with most at stake in the cleanliness of their immediate environment. Since it was a largely Muslim community, I involved the mosque and the leadership of the local Jama'ath (as well my local Congress party workers). With their blessings, it became something everyone in the area could participate in and could share the benefits of - the opposite of a few leaders sweeping a street and disappearing.
The UPA government appointed and paid "swachhata preraks" under the Nirmal Bharat programme. The NDA has apparently abolished the provision, perhaps as a cost-cutting measure, or maybe on the laudable premise that every citizen of India, not just an appointed few, should make cleanliness his or her personal responsibility. It hasn't happened, though.
There's a lot to be said in praise of the PM putting cleanliness at the top of the national agenda. As I wrote last year, no individual Indian can match the reach of a Prime Ministerial initiative. When a PM picks up a broom, it is news; the country pays attention. By launching his Swachh Bharat campaign on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, the Prime Minister has grabbed the nation's attention. But he simply hasn't done enough with it - and the attention is, inevitably, fading.
My fear is that Swachh Bharat will again be reduced to one of those empty rituals, a label without content, a slogan devoid of substance. If that happens, it will be far worse than if Mr Modi had never devised Swachh Bharat in the first place. Nothing corrodes a nation's spirit more than empty cynicism - but raising hopes without taking the basic steps to fulfilling them produces the most cynicism of all. Swachh Bharat should not be reduced to one more Modi public-relations gimmick, more visible in the headlines than in the streets.

                            @Shashi Tharorr: Good points raised dear Shashi. Cutting across political lines, you should be made a cabinet rank minister with the sole objective to driving the Swach Bharat campaign. Cleanliness should be driven as a habit and not tokenism. It's basic to our health, wealth and sustainability. I wish you could be made a minister for this. It will be great day for our democracy. Let meritocracy, passion and skill set drive appointments.

Two things are imperative:-<br/>
1. Strict regulation, if not outright ban on polybags.<br/>
2. Dedicated Sewerage line and its treatment before it is discharged in any water body.

                            we Indians should within start to be clean, then we can achieve swatch Bharat, crores and crores of funding is not the answer.... Simple example... How many U.S. Are following simple rules such as traffic signal.. They day we Indians come out of the "chaltha hai challna dho" trap then we can start to see some progress. So no point in blaming the government for everything... If every Indian concisely starts to contribute, cooperate and be mindful of their surroundings then things will start to change... So wake up indians you can do it ...

                            Swach Bharat is very important and the need of the hour. An administration that focuses on the finer points of governance like cleanliness and hygiene usually gets the big ticket items also targeted better because as they say, the devil is in the details and if you work out the micro aspects of swach Bharat, it will show the determination of the administration to take forward its change agenda. At the macro level, the administration will have to improve efficiency in almost all the areas and reduce corruption for Swach Bharat to succeed. If readers recall Rudy Guiliani's way of changing New York from the high crime and dirty city to a bustling metro with historically low levels of crime was to target the small signs of crime like graffiti on walls and metro trains and empowering police to take action on seemingly small infractions of law by citizens. This brought a huge change in attitudes of citizens and the law enforcement agencies where once hopelessness prevailed on the situation; it changed to one of optimism and a belief that things can be improved. Let us do whatever it takes to make Swach Bharat a success.

                            I fully agree Mr. Tharoor. There is NO programme at the ground to further this so-called Swatchh bharat campaign. ULBs are cash starved- Modiji is simply visiting foreign countries and thinking clicking selfies with clean foreigners is going to further his so called campaign. Where the basic mindset is faulty, how can you expect the country to go clean at one call of the PM? Is he the Oracle, or God? A sustained slow and systematic campaign is required. And most important- this rant about "smart cities" has to end. It appears the PM is totally disconnected from the average Indian populace now.

                            Sensible criticism. Swach Bharat is not taking off mainly because Indians are not convinced about it. They cannot imagine living in a clean country. And it requires a massive change of mindset. Like the outdoors belongs to me as much as the indoors. Like spitting and urinating in public is not the done thing. Like even if someone else litters, I will not. Like public hygiene should be made a compulsory subject in high school, with practicals. Like garbage management should be given industry status. Like Sweden is grappling with a massive shortage - of garbage. How cool is that? Tharoor has a tendency to talk sense. Which makes him unpopular in the Congress. And gets upbraided by his boss for this most unCongress like attribute. Poor Tharoor.

                            Swachh Barat is an idea. Yes it needs funding and action. At par with centre, it is our responsibility to contribute to it. I don't remember Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and I don't care who initiated Swachh Bharat. We should focus on to make it a success for ourselves and not for anyone to reap it's glory.

                            Interesting article highlighting the challenges facing this mission.  Dr. Tharoor, if cleaning every village or stream or road requires central funding, the mission cannot scale. The stakeholders in your (or any other) local river are the local residents. It is essential that local resources be raised to attend to local problems.  While the Center can raise awareness of the problem, and perhaps provide seed funds to get the mission rolling, expecting massive infusion of Central funding I think is unrealistic given the number of other challenges that need addressing.  Your Vizhinjam beach effort shows the way...but it needs to be sustained locally without looking for external resources.  I hope you and your constituents persevere.

Ok PM kick started and you are a member, instead of again falling into the lazy trap, like no money blah blah etc, may be the congress or you could ask any corporate co to adopt any street or road or any ares of 5000 people and ask them to do some social funding like waste treatment, this will help rather than crying foul like your predetermined notes.

                            It is an excellent article by Dr. Shashi Tharoor. It is the right time that you have reminded the PM and the readers of this news portal about the fading spirit of much acclaimed Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. I do agree with Dr. Shashi that a mere clean-up can't be an end in itself, but a first step in a comprehensive effort to improve public sanitation. A lot lot be done in the level of planning and the execution of plans regarding the collection of garbage and then processing it, perhaps conversion to biogas or other products. As I live in Europe and see the cleanliness of the streets and surroundings, I always think about my motherland India where we lack such cleanliness. Let us hope for the success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

                            Neither Mr Modi nor Mr Tharoor understand that Swachha Bharat Abhiyan is a matter to be handled by civic bodies and they should collectively coax the civic officials for its failure. They must show them the report on Handling of Municipal Solid waste prepared by the earstwhile planning commission. This matter requires an appropriate thrust and monitoring of the outcome of action taken by civic officials. But no MP or PM has any control over them and therefore, these worthies will keep making a noise at wrong places at wrong times. The matter has been rightly taken up by the NGT and has asked the Delhi govt and Central Govt to give a report on the matter when they address the issue of Landfill in Delhi.

i just couldn't control myself responding to such a well written article/critique. In my opinion, we must first start the exercise from homes: involving housemakers to at least collect garbage in two separate cans; one for bio-degradable and other non-biodegradable. This separation should be carried forward through garbage collection/disposal teams. Ultimately, bio-degradable waste can be utilized as manure and other partly recycled or incinerated.<br/>
You are so right about photo-ops and rhetorics.

                            He said it well and accepted "It had raised awareness, action on the ground was lacking and he would need to provide much more Central funding.!! Creating awareness among 130 crore people is not a small task. Tharoor deliberately hiding the number of toilets constructed during the last 1 year which is much higher than the last 60 years of Congress rule.

                            We as citizens have little or no civic sense - while we keep our houses spotlessly clean we do not think twice about pitching our garbage on the streets. Swatch Bharat is a good initiative by the PM but cannot expect him to micro manage all his initatives. The local administration from the Block level needs to ensure that their sweepers are doing their job on a daily basis. There are stories going around that the Govt sweepers who earn 15/25k per month outsource their work to unemployed people and pay them 5k per month and give something to his/her supervisor who gives something to his boss.........And it goes all the way up!!Almost every city in India had beautiful parks and water bodies which are unusable today because for too long local bodies have not done their jobs and it has come to a stage where they don't have the required funds to clean them up. This dengue in Delhi is the result of uncollected city garbage and choked drains where mosquitoes thrive. We are just lucky that dengue has not spread to many more cities in India because the situation is the same across the country except perhaps in areas under the ministry of defence and townships administered by companies in the public and private sector.

                            It's good to read comments from some Modi Bhakts, who have now started realizing that our PM is good at generating interest but hasn't matched it up with delivery.

                            I support NaMo, But I also would like some responsible opposition leaders who can hold mirror to Govt. Mr. Tharoor is one among them. Hope PM responds to his request to clean  Parvathy Puthenaar Canal in Thiruvananthapuram.

                            I assume Mr. Tharoor had used some of the money to install bins and other stuff from his MP budget allocation. If not then why he is not using that money in his constituency to contribute in Abhiyaan.

                            The very reason Modi asked Taroor was to get a honest opinion on swach Bharat. Mrutyunjaya and smart city projects will address solid waste management in a big way. <br/>
Modi having worked as CM of a state will know that it should start with local bodies and states. W<br/><br/>
Lot of people in the comments commented as Nirmala abhyan etc. How many had even heard of nirmal abhyan and any feed back on progress or seen a toilet built under that program or a solid waste management plant etc. They were all like coal and telecom scam to mint money for cong people.

                            The very fact you are writing the article now and not during the previous regime indicates your hypocrisy. If the funding was available earlier - we would have been cleaner earlier - hence your argument and the basis of the article is broken to begin with. Me Tharoor, try again - this time with a non political bias and clean up a non-beach area where the tides don't wash up anyways.

                            Valid criticism. Swach bharat can happen if we can see Big Dustbins at least every 50-100 mts. But Mr. Modi other than inspiring people to keep public spaces clean, has NOT ensured even Dustbins are present every 50-100 mts in at least 5 of our major cities.<br/><br/>
I am HUGE MODI supporter. And i think a leader like him is huge for India. But I have to say the basics of addressing the garbage problem is still to be addressed. Why can't 1 City in india outsource the entire garbage management problem to a USA company (In USA waste collection and management is handled by private or listed companies) ? I can bet they can make the City spotless within a span a few weeks, install trashbins at most places, Clean &amp; Fence empty sites , enforce fines those that throw open Garbage etc. <br/><br/>
Also, the cleanliness TV ads have huge room for improvement . Why don't the ads suggest what people need to do or don't ? the specifics are lacking. Example a visual indicating where garbage needs to be thrown and where it should NOT ?<br/><br/>
Mr. Tharoor - Can you suggest my idea to Mr. Modi the next time you meet him ? Lets outsource the entire waste management to USA company like "Waste management(wm)" and measure them by outcomes ?

                            Please look at this FB page - The Ugly Indian.. People like u and me have taken the responsibility of keeping their area clean, renovating, painting etc.       the biggest problems with us Indians is we have lost pride in ourselves, in our country.                      everything is not someone else's ie. Modi's problem. Morons.

                            Very good statement on status of Swachh Bharath Abhiyan. We must appreciate Tharoor for his eagerness to see this Abhiyan delivers. Despite he being an opposition MP. Especially in the present of context of Dengue deaths in Delhi and elsewhere.<br/><br/>
Dear Sashi, funds, or lack of them, is a significant factor. But considering the corruption how much it can deliver is doubtful. Instead center can penalize or offer incentives to states and local bodies over implementation of this scheme.

                            This is the difference between Mr Tharoor and Mani Shankar Aiyer. While Tharoor puts forward valid points and loopholes in current government which is the part of a constructive opposition, Mr Aiyer simply spits out venom out of personal hatred and bias. Sonia and her stooges should learn from Mr Tharoor how constructive opposition should function and keep the government in check.

                            Dear Tharoor Sir, would central Govt. fund solve anything. What is duty of Kerala Govt. in cleaning canal you are referring to? Or now with Modi, all problems in nation is to be sorted out by Central Govt. only? What is needed is strict laws and implementation as well as social awareness (with program such as swachchh Bharat) and also teaching school kids in their social study as subject in early years.

                            Unless civic bodies come on board, we are solving only one half of the problem. The way they collect garbage in open vans and garbage thrown again on the roads, this has to change. People are not using newer tools either. Composting at home should be encourage for organic waste - the same can be collected and used in gardens.
