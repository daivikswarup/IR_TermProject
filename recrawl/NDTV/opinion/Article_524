Headline::::A Farmer Suicide That Shamed India, But Not its Politicians



DateTime::::2015-04-22T22:25:00+05:30




                                His name was Gajendra, said the Delhi Police, while giving details about the farmer from Dausa in Rajasthan who committed suicide at the Aam Aadmi Party rally today in the capital. Till this afternoon he had no name, like most farmers who have killed themselves over the years.
Gajendra was just another helpless farmer from Nangal Jhamarwada village, a father of three who had been disowned by his kin after rain and hailstorm damaged his crop.
He was in distress, like lakhs of farmers in the country, many of whom commit suicide away from the media glare. But Gajendra could have been saved as he climbed a tree in public while Arvind Kejriwal's party leaders waxed eloquent on the performance of his two-month-old government. Some people shouted at the farmer, the rest watched, some cameras got exclusive footage.
In deep pain, the farmer wanted to send out a message to our political outfits to stop playing their political games at the expense of his ilk. Gajendra, who died before reaching the hospital, indeed ended up teaching us a lesson at the cost of his life. He now lies in a mortuary at the hospital. From now on he will be just another number in a long list of farmers who committed suicide.
They say art imitates life and today's shameful political blame game after the farmer died, proves it. For many of us who watched the film Peepli Live, the cast of characters in today's gruesome episode seemed so familiar. While I write this I feel ashamed of myself for drawing parallels in this tragic episode with a movie script. But this is exactly where Indian polity has left us.
When the man was being taken to hospital, Arvind Kejriwal took to the mic blaming the Delhi Police for the incident. He did not fail to remind us that Delhi Police is outside his jurisdiction; he accused the police of being politically motivated and so deliberately not helping the poor man.
The Aam Aadmi's self-appointed representative could have perhaps given the man some dignity in his death.
The theatre of absurd had only begun. His party leader Somnath Bharti alleged that the suicide was politically motivated and that there was a conspiracy to defame AAP.
Not to be left behind, the BJP's ever-so-efficient spokesperson Sambit Patra dressed in a crisp yellow shirt and operating from his air-conditioned room, mocked AAP for not being able to save the farmer. Sambit was articulate as usual and did not falter on punctuation or rhythm.
Meanwhile, Delhi BJP leader Satish Upadhyay too decided to jump into the fray when he alleged that his partymen saw AAP workers encouraging the farmer to climb the tree and commit suicide.
And now for the grand old party. As I write Rahul Gandhi has just exited Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where the farmer was taken, with reporters craving his reaction. His former MP from Dausa, Sachin Pilot expressed his pain and used the occasion to let us know that the present day government had made life miserable for farmers.
Sachin conveniently forgot to tell us about a farmer, also called Gajendra, who committed suicide in Yavatmal in 2012 while his party's government was in power. Gajendra had written a note to his fellow villagers not vote for the Congress-NCP combine that ruled Maharashtra, before consuming petrol.
While our politicians played to the gallery in the most sickening manner today, some of our TV journalists did a walk-through just below the tree where we are told Gajendra hanged himself with a piece of cloth.
Details about the tree and the manner in which the farmer killed himself were recounted with precision and the reaction from farmers was sought. Yes, another farmer was asked how it felt. He turned around and asked the reporter if he knew how successive governments have made farming a difficult profession, how their land is being snatched from them.
As I conclude this, most of our top politicians have visited RML hospital in Delhi, while some have reached Dausa to meet the family members of Gajendra. Ashutosh and Kumar Vishwas of AAP held a press conference telling us that the BJP had no business to blame them for the suicide as Narendra Modi too continued with his speech in Patna, Bihar, as bombs went off, two years ago.
While you watch all this, wait a moment, pause and think of Gajendra. He died desperately drawing our attention to the plight of many like him who die a thousand deaths each day as they see their starving children. We can be assured at least by the blame game that we are witnessing now, that though there will be no end to the distress of the kisaan of this land, Gajendra will posthumously get much television space the next few days.
Parliamentarians will hurl accuses and abuses at each other over the issue and we will wait with bated breath to hear how Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi frame their politically correct response. For all you know, some leader will in time pose happily with the family of Gajendra with a cheque to compensate for his life.
 
In his death, Gajendra has mocked us and our shallow dialogue on farmer suicide and the land acquisition ordinance. In his death, Gajendra has exposed the heartless Indian politician who will stop at nothing to claim his few minutes of fame. When was the last time we remembered a farmer? Well, we remembered a widow named Kalavati from Yavatmal whose husband, a farmer, killed himself. It is Kalavati's name that is etched in our memory as TV journalists flocked her humble residence after Rahul Gandhi enlightened us that he met her while on a tour of the state.
I will not be the least bit surprised when our PM, who has returned from his Europe trip post signing a very important Rafael arms deal, also tweets in solidarity with Gajendra. Yes, the  36 "ready-to-fly" French-made Rafale fighter jets that the likes of Gajendra would have never heard of.

                            How pathetic our political situation is! It is very said and painful to see Arvind jumping first to put the blame on delhi police before people could accuse him. I am sure people could have saved if they were swift enough. Our politicians are just trying to make politics out of everything. Even a poor farmer's death didn't make them united. I have seen in other countries politicians agree on at least any one of the ideologies like patriotism, safety, terrorism and so on. But in India, our politicians happily signed when US wanted to reject a visa (which he never applied) for Visa. I thought Arvind is an exception. But he is getting worse. How opportunistic he is! I remember the incident when he was slapped by someone at a rally. Now I see what it could be..

                            The insensitivity you talk about exists because of the nexus between political class, journalists and business in India. Even YOU failed to mention Gajendra died because Rajasthan/Center gov failed to compensate him for the crops damage due to unseasonal rains. Journalism is at SALE in this world.

                            Farmers have been committing suicides for last 10 years especially. Last 60 years Congress ruled India without any vision but on the basis of loan waivers. So instead of looking for long term solutions to Indian Farming, Congress adopted patchy, short cuts and vote grabbing methods. This country has been facing every big problem, be it Kashmir, be Farming, be corruptions, Congress needs to be  nailed by next 5 generations at least.

                            Well if a politician doesnt raise the issue you call him insensitive and when they do then you say they are playing politics. Please decide. This farmers suicide is a sad event and reflects on the issue which should be taken seriously by all, including journos. AK is being blamed for this and he has a right to defend himself. In any other country the police would have forced the man to come down as he is a threat to other people if he falls from the tree. But our police was watching him and laughing. Mr Gajendra is just a victim of a rotten system.

                            Such skepticism is uncalled for. Journalism is about reporting facts and not stirring up emotions using a tragedy. The journalist is not doing a favor to anyone by "shaming" the country. The common man does realise the gravity of the situation even without an emotional paint applied to it.

No point complaining just about the politicians when not a single person in the "rally"- whether politician or not, did nothing to save the man. Pathetic!

We Indians are destined to doom, the way we are being ruled and suffocated by the useless opposition. I have no more faith, no more trust and hopes from this country. Now watch out for national TV debates. All mud slinging , rockets flying here and there. Note this, you won't find all political parties and armchair analysts talking in common language. Only accusations and finger pointing. The core problem will continue for ever and ever

                            The only thing the government can do for farmers is to implement a nationwide crop insurance scheme, besides off-course not resorting to deceptive tactics to acquire their land.  But at a certain point, it is the responsibility of the farmer too to do what is best for himself.  Why does this guy who hanged himself have 3 children? Could one child not have been enough? Could the wife supplement his income with some work of her own?  At a time when IT workers are fearing losing their jobs and are undertaking austerity measures about their finances, I fail to see why the so called underprivileged do not.  How many people can the government or charities help?

                            The entire top AAP leadership was aware of this suicide drama, having called him to the rally themselves. After the mishap Vishwas even read the fake suicide note, Kejriwal kept giving his speech with the man hanging there. Within minutes he was blaming delhi police &amp; bjp for it. <br/><br/>
When exposed the next day Kejriwal apologised for the umpteenth time and aushutosh went on tv to shed crocodile tears.<br/><br/>

However, I don't agree with her view regarding the Rafale deal. Without going into the merits of that deal, I believe in the famous slogan - JAI JAWAN JAI KISAN - both our soldiers and farmers have to be strengthened for our country to Succeed!

                            @Shiva: Certainly this man was't going to suicide, but accidentally this became a suicide. His initial act was actually a part of large propaganda, which is about inciting people against the government and get political benefits like the last time delhi gang-rape case. Look at his cloths and shinny wrist-watch and more importantly he is comfortable posing in front of a camera. Does he look like a suicidal case from any angle? It is another classic case of the AAP brand politics. I would be very happy if the government and news channels investigate his financial crisis including the authenticity of the suicidal letter.  More importantly, before that Kejriwal should be charged with his murder since he was the organiser and he failed to ensure proper safety. According to western rules, he should be banned from holding such rallies/meetings.

                            The farmer's problem is not so straight forward that can be resolved by implementing few policies. As it is agricultural income is tax free so what more can the Govt do. They can provide insurance on subsidized rates to farmers for their crops but that would mean the insurance companies will have to monitor the harvest process for every individual farmer for which they have no resources. But still doable and needs all the sectors involved to work together. Also the percent of farmers committing suicide is still miniscule and way less than that in police force.

                            May the soul of person died RIP. Real farmers and sufferers have NOT been attending any of these sort of agitations, as they have to trek post to pillar, for a meal for his family. Neither the person, who got pushed to kill himself, nor his family members,look that poor. In fact he appeared "wanting Attention/ popularity". Delhites decision to elect, this Mango (Aam) man( Admi) party, has set a BAD precedent that, Agitation/ Arguing, can catapult one to heights. Another theory could be that, he was to "Act" to kill himself, finally got killed.Surely, it has nothing to do with waggeries of Agriculture.

                            So Rana the journalist decides to write this article about the state of Indian politics but in the process actually ends up politicizing the issue even more. It is not very hard to see her preferences for Congress party, she has scathing criticism for both AAP and BJP even though it is seriously questionable about BJP's role in entire episode. Agreed that Delhi police is controlled by centre, but did BJP think that arvind kejriwal will blame them for this episode. did BJP know that the entire plot might be scripted. So what do they have to answer if they were asked questions later.

                            Gajendra had 10 acres of land with guava and mango trees. He was not like Peplilive char. He was attention grabbing type person. Wanted to grab some attention at rally and speak about farmers problems. But Unfortunetely, accidentally, the incident took place.  You just used the incident to write a column. Others are using for something else.

                            "A Farmer Suicide That Shamed India, But Not its Politicians"  Ms. Ayyub, how come you provide all outdated information? It seems you are not equipped to write any better or your knowledge update is as limited as rahul gandhi. You must realise that "anyone who has no shame is a politician" or "a politician does not know the meaning of shame." For example, rahul gandhi calls this a suit-boot govt..What will he have to say for his own UPA's "loot-joot ki sarkar?" Can't you write about it? If you nurture hopes of joining the congress list of bootlickers, it is all well, but be updated on facts. By the way, BJP is playing right into the hands of useless authors like you. On the land bill, can you tell me one thing good the congress has done for farmers in the last 6 decades or so? Remember congress party's partner, sharad pawar, on the onion controversy recently? Remember Robert Vadra's sudden stroke of financial rise recently after land acquisition? When you write, see all around you and not just the things right in front of you. I dont mean to support BJP or any other party, but the congress party, under the Nehru-Gandhi family has brought India to more disasters than any other party or political party can even think of! I know the moderator will not like this, but I have done what I should do of conveying this to you. Arrogance will lead you to ignore this, but if you prefer to act like the "politician attitude" I explained above, Almighty would have to think twice or thrice to bring you out of the dirty "congress party hole" that you are in.

                            Ms.Ayub I think as a responsible citizen and belonging to the fourth pillar of democracy you please define who is responsible for the plight of farmers in our country and what Mr. Prime Minister is doing or plans to do about it. You can go on blaming polity etc but do you think that someone sitting at the very top should be accountable for the recent loss of life of farmers? Or you just plan to write articles to do a blame game.

                            Unfortunately in this country every one want to encash farmers, but no one want to pay the value of their services to this country, now it is time for the government to declare famers as equivalent to amry of this country, no doubt army are providing the restless services in protection of this country, whereas farmers are equally responsible in providing the restless services to feed the country, but in returns farmers are getting peanuts and all others are in good health in getting returns. It is high time we Indian should come forward and force to the government to give farmers the status of armymen which includes land, pension other benefits.

                            It is unfortunate that Indians are so indifferent to misery around them that instead of blaming some one or the other, they themselves will do nothing to reduce it to some extent.

                            Every body is talking about this suicide case but we all are ignoring the big question.. what about other farmers who had  committed suicide.. who is talking about them.. what kind of financial help they would get.. I m sure that now Gajendra family will get lakhs of rupees and i am not against it but will it stop the current situation..

                            Would be better if the facts about antecedents and financial status, the extent of damage to crops and real motives, like whether it was a suicide or a stage managed show of AAP etc come out in open. It would be unfortunate and too early to write the titles like Shame for India etc before the answers on these questions are revealed.

                            Agriculture has been turned into a holy cow, and more than the common farmer, it is being milked by rich and resourceful by way of laundering of black money, benefiting from subsidies on power and fertilizer and seeds etc. government would do real justice to the poors and farming community alike if the farm income is also taxed, albeit with some suitable relief and capital gain on sale of farm land taxed like any other real estate. There should not be situations like having the cake and eat it too. The land bill may be a bad thing, but continuance of income tax exemptions on farm income and capital gains are worse and depriving the poors including the ordinary farmers of their share of nations wealth.

                            before you give your obnoxious, stupid and immature statements, wait until the investigations are over. This might not be a suicide but a provoked Joke which went horribly wrong!! So stop blaming anyone for this lone instance, but rather focus on the other instances where farmers are actually dying daily.

                            How shameless can be shamed? Modi reacted as if this is first suicide by a farmer. He committed suicide at his doorsteps so that he should come out of Bhashans and election mode. Congress is also doing what they were doing on Insurance bill. Anand Sharma etc are double speak.

                            Liberalization, Globalization &amp; Privatization has brought majority of Indians as sacrifice goat for communal forces, economic exploitation by rich and wealthy people, dominations of Business Houses, Celebrities kind of Gladiators, Bureaucrats, Politicians and Media nexus. All these forces add pressure to common man to vie and compete with everyone to become top of the social strata dominated by these people. These people at the top of social strata are having nexus to wealth sharing classic example how Indian Premiere League franchise being auctioned to Bollywood Celebrities, Politicians, Businessman, similarly Coal Blocks offered to Businessman and Power Brokers all this crony capitalism eroded faith and trust in the constitution and government intention. Same people are advocating for exploitation of farmers with Land Acquisitions and subsequent allocation like IPL kind franchise to capitalist and Celebrities, Politicians, and Bureaucrats.

                            you are factually wrong - Gajendra's family himself is saying he was not in distress and he did not have much crop damage. So as of now, we dont know why he committed suicide.<br/><br/>
But I agree in general, farmers are in distress and they are committing suicide. Actually for far too long, farming has been neglected. Let us work to pay attention to improve this. For proper irrigation, we need to construct dams or some irrigation projects for which some land is required. Let us try to create a land bill that is aimed at farmer's benefit. Just saying that all land acquisition is bad is not right. We need land to improve agriculture in the country.

                            In India the farmers are the only self respected person rather than the politicians.  Farmers merely a small bank loans which they cannot able to repay the commit suicide where as the government providing loans to the businesmens and corporates and they are not even paying the loan and enjoying with the businessmen or corporates. Indepndence was obtained by wearing  only by one Dhothi by Gandhi where as today it has been cheated in the name of development by one suit.

He must be schizophrenic otherwise no one commits sucide in such melodramatic manner and slogan jai jawan jai kisan<br/>
Raana Ayub writes well but in this no point waxing eloquent and crying and shedding tears over the death of a mentally sick man!
