Headline::::Dear Government, Hands Off My Porn



DateTime::::2015-08-05T03:28:00+05:30




                                Porn ka matlab??? Bolo bolo, Sirji...
The barely there fig-leaf over the government's 'progressive thinking', wilted miserably and fell off like an unused condom. There was a limp attempt to back track on the porn ban... but by then, India had drubbed those holier-than-thou fellows in Delhi and forced them to retreat. It was almost unanimously agreed that the clumsy move to ban 857 "offensive" sites was as unsatisfying to both parties as coitus interruptus during a 'suhaag raat'.
Personally speaking, I was irritated enough by the government's hypocrisy to start boasting about my own credentials! Remember the famous 'porn writer' tag? I am now wearing it like a badge of honour! When I tweeted about the proposed ban, I expected the trolls to have a field day - and predictably enough, they did exactly that. "How will she sell her books now?" someone wondered. Like I have always sold them - through bookshops!
Ditto for the question - "How will we watch adult channels now?" Like before! Same to same...
Come on, even if 8, 857 or 80,857 sites are blocked, 'porn' (unimaginative word!) won't disappear. And Indians are unlikely to wake up purified and sanitised one fine morning saying, "Oh God! What a relief ! No more gandi gandi baatein, gandi gandi images.
Thank you, Government for saving our souls! Thank you for keeping us out of purgatory! Thank you for purging us."
That still won't take care of Asaram.
That's the problem.
We can all bathe in Dettol every morning. And we can white wash our sins. Our mouths can be rinsed with boric acid.... but who can get inside the minds and hearts of a billion plus people and stop their sexual fantasies?
This is nuts. In fact, it is embarrassingly jejune. Had it been just this nonsense about blocking adult content sites, one would be tempted to say, "Jaaney do. These people have no better kaam dhanda... they've probably never had inspiring sex in their lives..." But the purpose behind this move seems to be kuch aur. It has a twisted political agenda that makes S and M look cute.
In a country where an alleged rapist (Asaram) appears in textbooks as a saint, along with some of India's most prominent philosophers and thinkers, the government's efforts to curtail basic freedoms, seem almost perverse.
If it starts here, goes unchallenged, is pushed through adopting familiar draconian ways to 'punish' offenders, where does it stop? Will those parliamentarians caught on camera happily enjoying porn while the future of the nation is being debated, get arrested for breaking the law? Why not start with them? Why not set a good example? Unko pakdo, Sirji!
Private pleasures are the prerogative of each and every citizen of the world. There's nothing official about it. It's nobody's bloody business. Governments should never intrude into that space! Hands off (pun intended!), Sirji. Â 
Before we get to that (and can we blame those parliamentarians for distracting themselves with hot stuff, given the dead boring quality of parliamentary debates?), we need to ask a basic question - crude as it is: what's worse - shagging in private or slagging off in public?
Any answers, Sirji?(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Every porn clip is degradation of women and their degnity as they only pander to the leery tastes of dirty minded men. These people never understand this how bad they are to teens. I hate these Hippocrates for their rooftop shouts for free porn in the net. Hate them all for not giving children right environment to grow healthy minded

                            I think it was a knee jerk (pun unintended) reaction by the government in response to the supreme court's enquiry about the government's efforts against child porn. Nothing to show to that end, it simply took some lawyer's list of sites and shot off an order to bring them down 'temporarily'. And like Loin's 'smart boy', it put the onus back on the judiciary by putting the ball(s) in the court.

                            Government should not interfere with private matters of an individual. No one has a right to say what the other should do or not in their own private spaces. What I do in my private space is my own business. Preaching morality is not the governments business. Instead focus on providing jobs for all. An idle mind is a devils workshop.

                            We grow with what we see, learn and taught to us. Porn addition destroys even adult individuals ,not to mention how could a kid think in a mature way as the so called idiots who are all over the places debating against Child porn or free access to porn for kids. Kids see, does, gets addicted to porn in tender age and ruin their adolescent age without they thinking of their future. Does some one tell the importance of this age to the writer above. when it really comes for adolsescents to enjoy the sex with their life partner,they fail miserably.. Can we assume, at this point, they have any idea of Romance, healthy sex, emotional feelings which were long gone with addiction??? certainly not, because the above said are very essential for a family bond  and relationship between life patners. The so called paid media, dirty columists, did they ever talk positive on the ban, In the guise of debates, they always says it bad to ban.. did they ever say ,these are all the/ can be alternative steps which can be taken to stop the menace....Skys are not falling apart if kids dont see Porn.. Look at the intentions on why the ban was enforced.. Those  "adults" who are already addicted to watch porn are Free to watch in private, why are they barking all over places in public..  WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FUTURE GENERATION SO THEY HAVE A PIOUS FAMILY BONDING AND THE GENERATIONS CAN CONTINUE SO FORTH .. SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THIS IN A FAMILY "HIS KIDS AND HER KIDS ARE PLAYING WITH THEIR KIDS, AND IN THE BREAK WATCHING PORN... To All Indians, Stand up against those who are opposed to the ban, if you from your innerself think, it is for a better society and this is all we can give for the generations ahead.. When there is demand, there would be supply, and innocent childs/girls/boys/women continue to be trafficked or lured to meet the demand .. lets cut the demand... if ISP's cannot restrict as they say a new one creeps up every day...employ people for  watch out and keep a centralized database and share among ISPs....Any and every thing cannot be see from a prism of Business...People need to contribute....

                            On one side I agree that porn has corrupted the minds of our youth but the reason that rapes happen due to porn is difficult to digest. Rather than catching the culprits and punishing them hard, you can't build a safe society for women just by putting ban on some nasty sites. There are many hardcore techies in India who will find some way to crack this sites and watch porn. So please grow up and show us some real action...........

                            I feel the ban was initiated by some trader lobby who has a stock of unsold DVD's and want to convert and sell them. It was proven true as the cost of a porn DVD has risen from Rs 100 to Rs 300 and people started queing up for them as the daily dose of free stuff had dried up.

                            Indian society is still conservative, and therefore Indian girls are less sexually active as compared to their western counterparts... In such a scenario having access to 24*7 porn only makes men in the society more dangerous... There is a time for everything, either make Indian girls as sexually active as the western girls or better ban Porn to avoid rampant rapes

                            The writer conveniently ignored the most basic question - how you stop watching children from watching Porn. Blanket ban may not be the answer, but what other options can we have? Or she finds that it is perfectly acceptable for them to watch it?

                            Govt has banned some sites, not all. I feel it is better because due to mobile and internet access, people are already getting corrupted.<br/>
It was a good decision. Why they reversed it, is something which we wonder at.<br/><br/>
I feel ashamed that some celebrities were condemning against the ban.<br/>
they should have shown some responsibility about society instead of their own pleasures.<br/><br/>
Shows their mindset.<br/><br/>
In my opinion, banning too vulgar websites is a must in such a populated country called India.

                            Crappy article. this is not about 'kisko pakdo aur kisko nahi'. This is about logic. You sit on your high horse, go to designer events, talk brands, call for world peace hence maybe the logic is beyond you.<br/>
Ever spoken to kamwali bais in north india? you know the most common problem they have? husbands coming home drunk and hitting them. Why? coz 1) they dont know how to handle alcohol and 2) influenced by others in their social circle.<br/>
Now im not saying porn can be as harmful as alcohol. But, the fact is that it is harmful, it will lead to domestic rape if not outside of home.<br/>
At present, we do not have internet penetration, but it will reach all sections of society faster than sex education or even regular education.<br/>
So dont chase Sirjee without trying to debate internally with logic

                            Porn is popular not only with men but women also. Sex is a basic and natural urge. Like food. And we should over eat. Like we have table manners there need to be some basic restraints. I know several men who demand unacceptable sexual behaviour from their wives expecting a wife should accept such odd behaviour.

                            No point in banning all those sites - we are missing on torrents. I guess the best thing would be to charge some extra money for just the porn sites and send those bills to all the users who've accessed these websites - tracking down their ISPs. That should work then right..!  Imagine how it would be if your mom/dad/wife/kids find those bills @ home ?? ð

                            @shobha de, have you not noticed the kind of porn available? It is unnatural, disgusting and almost criminal. There is no need or place for porn in any civilised society. By the way who are these people, influential agencies that made court change such a sensible decision ?

                            Some of the idiot journalists like above without any research just have a habit of writing on sensitive topics, I clearly read today, the government wanted to ban only child pornography and I believe everyone support it and you are very successfully diverging the topic to defame government. Any answers madam jii?

                            Rapes, eve teasing, murders have exponentially increased ever since Internet has come into being. I dont think there is any individual in India does see porn sites. Its ok as long as they confine seeing to it. Problems will crop up only when perverted people. In India, people talk of rights but forget responsibilities. When we are like that we have to face the consequences. God save Indians in particual and people in the world in general

                            @:@Madhava S: Madhava!!Indians do everything in secret but are the most hypocrite like you who would try to be like "oh! its corrupting minds of our children" as if you haven't seen porn in your life. In fact the taboo of talking about sex in our society makes it more desirable, more you are going to ban things more they are going to come back. Grow up, I am sure as soon as Sunny Leone entered Bollywood you surfed her pictures and videos like million times! Don't be "Oh I am not like that" person...there are at least billion other hypocrites like you in this country! We should in-fact ban the hypocrites like you!

                            Please ban the politicians as they are corrupting our minds and country much more than anything else. They are corrupt, hypocrites, liars, looters, goondas, rapists, killers. All of them have taught the country one thing, if you are on the wrong side of the law, you have to become politician to get away from law. If you need any proof, just go check behavior any relative/friend/partner of any politician with any normal citizen of this country, do i need to say anything more?

                            I cherish the support and the attention the ban is attracting. With equal likes of people supporting and defending it. With 90% user having access to the internet and its content in the privacy of their beds and sofas . Porn has far more damaging effects then our learned &amp; articulate writers perceive and write against it.<br/><br/>
Its not  far from 12 year old, using the mobile phone <br/>
Its not far from a stalker <br/>
Its not far from thousands of forced sex workers <br/><br/>
Yes it employees people , yes it is therapeutic to few, Yes religion and porn has been constant in human existence and we have every right to defend it.<br/><br/>
But stop give it a thought would you like a 6 year old walk up to you and ask DO YOU KNOW ABOUT 69 ?

                            Miss Shobha de, The article above of your's are personal, that's fine but still your personal views are read by public. My problem with this article is "use of name of Asaram " which is purely irrelevant and satire. As asaram after being prisoned for more then 2 years still he is accused and not convicted. <br/>
Please be careful, This is not done. First let it prove in courts that asaram is rapists then you chose to attack if you believe in our judiciary system, otherwise say openly i don't believe in judiciary system.<br/>
It may be fun for you and many others but not fun for remaining many others.

                            Now porn has made both kinds of affects, bad and good. There are many sites were a boyfriend has uploaded videos of her girlfriend due to breakups and the same is reported almost everyday in news papers. Even child abuse is being shown on some porn.<br/><br/>
There have to be means were privacy and even such incidents both need to be addressed. Since it is very hard to formulate them Government has to try trial and error methods until they find some solution to it.  <br/><br/>
Government acting of supreme courts directive for banning child porn and the operators have simply said they cant verify. Instead of blame games it would be better to find out solutions were it is used and not misused.
