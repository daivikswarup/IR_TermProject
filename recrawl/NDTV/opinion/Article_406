Headline::::Why I have Spoken Now on Afzal Guru's Hanging



DateTime::::2015-02-10T16:33:00+05:30




                                
	(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	It doesn't take much to stir up a controversy in our media. As I've learned repeatedly, a simple tweet is often enough.
	Asked by a tweeter what I thought of the statement issued by five Congress MLAs in Jammu and Kashmir in which they described the hanging as a "mistake", I replied to the questioner: "I think the hanging was both wrong & badly handled. Family should have been warned, given a last meeting & body returned." This resulted in a veritable paroxysm of outrage on television and a couple of thousand hate tweets in response, accusing me of everything from molly-coddling terrorists to treason.
	The debate is taking place on the second anniversary of Afzal Guru's hanging, which has occasioned protests all over the Kashmir Valley, at a time when the process of government formation in the state is yet to be concluded. The Kashmiri Congress legislators, in their statement, had said, according to ndtv.com: "The demand for clemency for Guru was justified and his mortal remains should be returned to his family. The decision to not allow his family members to meet him one last time was also a mistake." This was portrayed by the media as an exercise in winning the support of an independent MLA, Engineer Rashid, for the Rajya Sabha candidacy of Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, and did not occasion half as much of an uproar as my own seeming endorsement of it a day later.
	If I felt this way, some have reasonably asked, why did I not say so publicly when it happened two years ago and I was serving in government? Simply put: I was not free to do so. I was a Minister of State in the Human Resources Development Ministry, and my work had nothing to do whatsoever with that of the Home Ministry, which handled such matters. It would have been a severe violation of governmental norms to express a divergence of opinion on matters concerning any other colleague's portfolio. A statement by a Minister of State for Home publicly challenging a decision of the HRD Ministry would have been just as inappropriate.
	Since I had nothing to do with the Afzal Guru decision and was involved in no official forum where I could have participated either in making the decision or in discussing it formally afterwards, I kept my views to myself, expressing them at the time only in private conversation.
	India is a country of laws; no one can argue that the legal process was not fully followed, all the way up to the Supreme Court. It is indeed true that it was only after all judicial processes had been exhausted that Afzal Guru was hanged. It is not my place to question the judgement of the Supreme Court - nor, for that matter, that of the President of India, in refusing to grant the clemency that was sought on Afzal Guru's behalf. Whether Guru's actual role as an accomplice - not one directly responsible for the assassinations of our fourteen martyrs in the Parliament complex - warranted the death penalty is also not a matter for individual citizens to determine.
	Those who, under our Constitution, are competent to make this decision have made it, and I don't challenge their right to do so either.
	However, while we are on the subject, it is not irrelevant to raise the issue of whether the continued use of the death penalty reflects well on us as a society. Since my days in the United Nations, I have been a considered critic of the death penalty, and in this I reflect the view of a majority of the world's peoples.  United Nations General Assembly resolution 62/149 of 2007 calls on States that maintain the death penalty to suspend its use, establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its abolition, and in the meantime, to restrict the number of offences which it punishes - and to respect the rights of those on death row.
	The resolution has subsequently been repeatedly reaffirmed by overwhelming majorities, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, echoing his predecessor Kofi Annan, has declared as recently as July 2014 that "the death penalty is a cruel and inhumane practice" that "has no place in the world of the 21st century." In Ban's words, "The taking of life is too absolute, too irreversible, for one human being to inflict on another, even when backed by legal process" -  a view I happen to share.
	But let's not go there either: I can just imagine our denizens of the right, especially on social media, frothing at the mouth to denounce the very notion that liberal international pieties can apply to the grim fight against terrorism on our soil.
	What about the rest of my objection? Afzal Guru was hanged without his family being notified beforehand; his wife and young son were not given an opportunity to meet him for one last time before his execution; and his body was not returned home for burial.  Every one of these is standard procedure in the many other cases where India has carried out a sentence of death. Not adhering to these well-established practices was wrong, not just because it hurt the sentiments of Guru's family, but because it was violative of our own values as a society. In behaving the way we did, we betrayed ourselves -- as a nation, a society and a civilization.
	I am sure various arguments can be adduced for these actions. The notification to the family was sent in the usual way, but reached them two days after the execution had been carried out. No meeting was possible since the decision to proceed with the execution was taken swiftly once the President had rejected clemency and before the family had applied to see him. The body was not returned for fear of creating unrest in the Valley and allowing his grave to become a potential locus for future separatist agitation. I understand all these arguments: in my view they are just not good enough to override our duty to ourselves as custodians of India's civilizational values.
	 
	Former Prime Minister Vajpayee once declared he intended to deal with Kashmiri separatism on the basis of insaniyat - humanity. Did our conduct reflect our own insaniyat? Or has our outrage at terrorism led us to something closer to insanity?
	 
	I am a strong advocate of counter-terrorism, while stressing that it must not become an all-embracing concept that is used to cloak, or justify, violations of human rights.  Indeed any sacrifice of fundamental freedoms in the struggle against terror will ultimately be self-defeating.  As my old boss Kofi Annan used to say, those who are willing to give up liberty for security will end up with neither security nor liberty. In India's democratic society there are roadmaps for non-violent dissent. Power relations between ethnic, linguistic and religious groups and the State are mediated by the rule of law. When some people dissent, and even resort to violence, there are mechanisms to deal with them justly. And the system offers hope for change -- and the means to change --without the need for violence.
	In all this, it is vital to respect human rights. As understandable fear and suspicion dominate the law-enforcement response, human rights, the presumption of innocence, the rejection of religious or ethnic stereotyping, must not be jettisoned in the war against terrorism. The response to terror must not place in jeopardy all the hard-fought civil liberties and protections that have come to distinguish Indian civilisation and that are enshrined in our Constitution.
	As Mahatma Gandhi used to say, you judge a society by the way it treats its weakest members. No one is weaker or more powerless than a hapless prisoner on death row. That is why the State, in a final gesture of decency, treats him humanely, allows him to see a family, receive a priest's benediction, and choose his own last meal. These may make little difference to a man who is about to be hanged, but they show us as a decent nation, capable of compassion even while carrying out the ultimate punishment.
	India has years of experience of dealing with terror without undermining the very values the terrorists seek to destroy. We must ensure that in attacking terror, the cure does not become worse than the disease. Building human rights safeguards into our counter-terrorist strategies and conduct is absolutely essential.
	The very fabric of India's democratic governance rests on the rule of law. It is vital that our war on terror not become a war against justice, liberty and decency, but rather a war to preserve justice, liberty and decency for all.
	And I say this for India's sake, not for Afzal Guru's.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Shashi Tharoor should seriously consider joining AAP. He has the potential to take AAP to great heights. He is someone ask should invite to join.

                            Hello Shashi-jee: Just this morning I was talking about you with my brother (apropos this particular Afsal Guru issue). Frankly, I cannot for one understand how u can  side with those telling that decency should have been shown to this individual, who tried to tear into the fabric of the biggest of all institutions this nation can be proud of -- a WORKING DEMOCRACY. Did Afsal n his cohorts think twice about killing not 1 not 2 but 14 Indians? Did he and his friends allow them time to go n meet their family &amp; tell them bye byes ? So then how can you advocate that for such a person ? NO NO .... please don't come with the argument that they are 'terrorists' and we are a nation state. ONLY by a very strong response and united resolve can we tell them "would be terrorist" that NO RESPECT WILL BE SHOWN TO THEM AT ALL.... NO RIGHTS OR PRIVILEGES given to them. PERIOD .... n hence prevent them from straying down the same path.<br/>
You may be dead against the death sentence, agreed. But please do educate us on what else can be a response to the brutality shown to "Nirbhaya" and the most recent Rohtak case  and such other monstrosity perpetuated by humans against fellow humans ? How efficient it has been in reducing the number of future cases is a totally different point of argument. But yes the law and its implementation should serve as a deterrent and in my opinion more swift implementation of it would make the whole thing more effective. Please work towards that - JUDICIAL REFORMS, instead of coming up with such absolutely crass defense of the indefensible.

                            Well said Mr Shashi Tharoor. It was clearly unfair to play with a life a human being to satisfy the 'collective consciousness' of society. It is a black mark in Indian judiciary system.

                            Dear Dr Tharoor, <br/><br/>
Your views and opinions are like a breath of fresh air. I wish there were more people in India particularity in the ruling circles who held such respectful views and opinions. Having been on the other side of the fence, I haven't ever seen a humane face of the 'civilisation' called India. Gandhi Jee's statement you quoted is an excellent barometer to test whether India as a society is treating Kashmiris in a fair manner <br/><br/>
A person has to be a Kashmiri and live in the valley to see a completely different face of the Indian democracy. I think from a Kashmiri perspective its fair to say that India treats Kashmir and Kashmiris similar to how cruel occupiers treat occupied people and territories. Treating genuine dissent as terrorism is a travesty. If India were to treat Kashmiris with respect - not violating their liberties on a daily basis, I am sure we would see a better resolution of the vexing Kashmir issue.<br/><br/>
Regards<br/><br/>
Faheem

                            Indian voters are willing to take the risk now compared to 20 years ago, especially young and educated people. AAP needs to take the chance in other states as well but after 1 or 2 years only, after proving them selves in Delhi. They need to instill confidence in Indian people they will fulfill the promises they made earlier. This victory will give confidence to the other parties with similar ideologies. Delhi voters proved that they want clean politics and most of the Indians want these clean politics too (Will Bihar prove it? Keeping my fingers crossed). This is definitely good thing for Delhi and India also. Dirty politicians will be scared of voters from now on. <br/><br/>
Hoping and praying to see clean politics in India in all states soon. God bless India.

                            Awesome article - the first I read about Tharoor and he eloquently makes his case using India's civilizational values as a focal point.<br/><br/>
Although not a Congress sympathizer, I truly wish people like him get to drive India ahead - we need clarity of thought in our actions, not the rantings of undeveloped thoughts that we see among trolls and the abusers on social media such as FB/Twitter. They only seek to divide the country on hate.

                            You are a good orator, it is difficult to defeat you in an argument. But just few points for your kind attention. I am sorry but I respectfully disagree with you in majority of your views in this subject. In my view, there were more than enough reasons for what they did, the way they did. Honestly speaking, we are not bothered about those alleged political move for Ghulam Nabi Azad. It is understandable and a lot of us already knew why you did not voice this opinion when you were a minister. Even when you say that Afsal Guru's death penalty decision was not for any of us to determine, it is clear from that paragraph that you did not agree with the punishment as he was not directly involved in the mission. I am afraid no one born in India or an Indian citizen who loves the country will agree with that statement. As an ordinary citizen, my quesiton is that, if one deliberately takes innocent people's lives, does he deserve to have a life of his own? If you have kept him in a jail with lifetime imprisonment, are you sure that there will not be flight highjacking to release him? We have seen this done successfully in our own country. You used Gandhiji's quotes to support Afsal Guru's case. What a shame!! At no point of time was Afsal Guru powerless. The very reason why his body was not allowed to take to Kashmir Valley was that even his dead body could create huge unrest, shows he was not at all a weakest link of the society. He was never a part of the society anyway. I read it with disbelief that you are moaning about "not adhering to well established practices" and "violating our own values". At least in this case, I strongly suggest you speak for yourself please!! As if your government always adhered to all well established practices. It is laughable to see your criticism of our outrage to terrorism. It is awful to see you talk about human rights of someone like Afsal Guru. What about the human rights of our Army men who were tortured in the so called enemy army torture camps that in fact is run by people like him? I strongly believe that a UN relief worker and a terrorist are not equally entitled for human rights. Find some quotes from great men, bend it as you wish and use it as and when, according to your convenience, even in places that are unfitting and unsuitable to confuse lesser mortals. I agree that it is a good tactic to "make feel" brainy guy in the room. Sometimes it helps to keep people to stop arguing with you too. Our war on terror is never a war against justice, it is a war for justice to the thousands of innocent victims. To us, Justice to my father who was killed in a so called "war" is more important than the justice to the terrorist who killed him. Just think - what if he was successful that day? And imagine you were inside the building. Would you still not agree with ultimate punishment for him? A strict approach or strong fight against terrorism is not going to harm India's civilizational values or insaniyat. I say this for our sake. And not Your's.

                            @Murugan Ramarpandian: Well Said my friend, why should we keep a terrorist in prison for many years and feed them and provide them everything including medical facilities out of our Money(Tax Payers Money), then every terrorist will come and kill our brothers and sisters knowing that they will be well taken care off, because we have People like Mr.Tharoor who will rob us to shield them in the name of humanity.<br/><br/>
What action is the Govt taking for misuse of internet or social media against Mr.Tharoor for creating an outrage in the name of personal opinion and hurting the sentiments of thousands of families who lost their beloved ones killed by terrorists.<br/><br/>
Shame on anyone how supports the Terrorists as human, planning and killing innocent people is not a human act no matter what religion they come from.

                            Mr. Shashi Tharoor (and tons of anti-capital punishment activists): I have read your opinion and would like to say this on behalf of all those civilized Governments who continue to practice death penalty. Death penalty is not something any sane person enjoys but it's the only deterrent these killers and rapists understand.  Unfortunately, our judiciary and executive branch have failed us on numerous occasions in carrying out the sentencing of hanging the guilty.  You have examples of continued rape and killings all over India, contract killers, and other anti-social gangs enjoying the benefit of our humane law and order system while a person with no money or influence languishes in Jails even after their allotted time of imprisonment. Unfortunately, our lawmakers, instead of concentrating more on law making job, are more interested in looking after their party activities, selfish agenda, and abusing the hospitality provided to them.  Engineer Rashid, should not mistaken as a champion of Kashmiris, but an opportunist who fished at the right time and got atleast 3 selfish Congressmen to bite at his bait.  Your reasons for not commenting of Afzal Guru hanging two years back shows your priorities, 1-Self, 2-Party, 3-National interests.
