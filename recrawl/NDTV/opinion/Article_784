Headline::::Why Hardik Patel Has Turned On Modi



DateTime::::2015-08-31T13:59:00+05:30




                                The most prosperous community in one of the more prosperous states of India has just taken to the streets in revolt against the acche din that are being denied to them. The Patidars or Patels of Gujarat are the dominant influence in a society of affluent farmers, successful businessmen, innovative entrepreneurs, leaders in the highly remunerative diamond industry and wealthy emigrants who have given a new word to the English (or, at any rate, the American) language: "potels" for the motels that the Patels run with such lucrative efficiency on highways all over the United States. 
Why should they turn out in lakhs - eighteen lakh at last count - to protest reservations from which they are excluded? Instead of being the showpiece of the Gujarat "model of development", and that too in the Prime Minister's home state, they are on the streets threatening to bring down the very government they were principally responsible for electing time and time again. Tho, Patel bhaiyon ko gussa kyon aata hai?
There are, of course, Gujarat-specific reasons for this wholly unexpected and unanticipated upsurge. And we can leave it to the Gujarat government to salvage what they can of the mess in which they find themselves. The more intriguing question to answer is why is it that the biggest beneficiaries of development are biting the hand that has so long fed them? 
The Rajdeep Sardesais and Shekhar Guptas have a favourite word to explain the startling outcome of the 2014 Lok Sabha election: the "aspirational" nature of India's youth which Modi tapped into, but the Congress ignored at its own heavy cost. I invite them to ponder over why the most aspirational community in all of India, the Patels, one moreover which has been the engine of Modi's spectacular rise to the summit, has so viciously turned against the very system that has brought them so much success. 
I suggest it is because those first mesmerized by the promise of acche din are also the first to be disillusioned when it does not come to them instantaneously. More to the point, those less mesmerized might take a little longer to be disillusioned, but disillusionment will not be long coming - and then it will spread like a plague that could threaten the Modi establishment's dreams of permanence that they have been assiduously nurturing these past 15 months. Hyperbole ('jumla') can win you one election. The taller the promise, the bigger the fall. This is the beginning of the end.
I do not celebrate the prospect for I fear the syndrome is symptomatic of a wider malaise: the dilemma of democracy and development. At Independence, we all assumed that development was desirable. It was what we had fought for. It was what we aspired to. While many were the ways to development being debated, there was a national consensus on the need for development. Equally, there was national consensus on the need for democracy. It was almost universally believed that democracy was the best political system within which to promote development - and till the eve of the Third Plan (1961), we thought we were succeeding, with Walt Rostow declaring that the first country to reach the "take-off stage" would be India. Then, a decade of war, 1961-71, left our growth rate stagnant and the argument began over the "Hindu" rate of growth. The answer, it was thought, might lie in liberalizing the economy to accelerate the growth process.
The most fervent advocates of LPG - Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization - persisted with their mantra although the first decade of liberalization returned very disappointing results, the average growth rate 1992-2002 of 5.9 percent being no more than 0.3 percent over the average growth rate 1980-90 of 5.6 percent. Then came the staggering acceleration under UPA I (which had its beginnings in the last year of the previous Vajpayee government) with growth rates touching 9.4 percent in 2006-07 and its being presaged that double-digit growth was just around the corner. 
That hope has since been dashed but the germane point for us to note in the context of the Patel agitation is that the acceleration of growth rates brought into sharp focus the fact that higher growth led to sharper inequalities. A whole new class of dollar millionaires (with a sprinkling of dollar billionaires) sprang into existence even as most Indians found their incomes growing by a few paise or, at best, a few rupees. A debate began over growth and equity, it being argued in the LPG corner that priority should be accorded to growth, whatever its consequences for inequality, because whatever the short-term political consequences of growth aggravating inequality, in the long term, at the end of the day, growth benefited all. When asked how far off was the "end of the day", the LPG-ists pointed to the Western world, eliding the fact that a measure of prosperity for all was achieved there some 150-200 years after the Industrial Revolution. That means our people could expect some measure of comfort by 2200 but not much before then! The deprived, it was believed, had no alternative but to take it on the chin. 
That was to reckon without democracy. Democracy is impatient. It seeks results within five years. If what is sought is not achieved within that time-span, the answer is obvious: kick the fellows out, more politely known as "anti-incumbency". Having thus got into a syndrome of frequent changes of government at virtually every election since the mid-90s, what is increasingly becoming clear is that every change of government is also bringing disillusionment with the system: "Natha Singh, Prem Singh/One and the same Thing"! Hence, this rightward swing to the strong man. Not just a swing from one party to another but a swing from the democratic pragmatists to the Strong Man at the helm who will single-mindedly put things straight because he has a 56-inch chest. One more swing to the right and we will end with dictatorship. 
It has generally been assumed that, as in Germany and much of Europe in the throes of the Great Depression of the '30s, it is the poor who would first vote for the strong man to end the curse of poverty in the midst of plenty. That has happened in India too, with the tribals of central India deciding they are sick of having to pay through massive displacement the price of so-called development. Comprising a mere 8 percent of our population, the share of the tribals in displacement has reached 55 percent, the worst case being Gujarat where their share has topped 76 percent. 65 million tribals have in 65 years lost their homes, their forests, their rivers, their herds, their livelihood, their customs and ways of life to enable high dams and deep mines to benefit the country. They are fed up. Else, they would not be assisting, or at least acquiescing in, the Naxal militants in their jungles. Our chaps in khaki have been chasing the chimera of a police-cum-military solution for more years than the Americans took to find Osama bin Laden but have come nowhere near finding an answer.
But this "most serious internal security threat" will prove as nothing compared to the chaos that will be engendered if the middle class beneficiaries of development, like the Patidars of Gujarat, decide to wage an urban rebellion against the establishment. We saw in the 80s what happened when the most prosperous famers of the country - the Punjabis - took to militancy. Development that is unequal spawns so much envy, even jealousy, that it undermines social stability and leaves millions frustrated and unhappy. When there is economic stagnation, social stratification is accepted. But when development churns society, as it did in Europe in the seventh decade of the Industrial Revolutions there, and is beginning to do in the seventh decade of our own Industrial Revolution here, it is time to wake up from our slumber and recognize that unless growth and equity are yoked together, we might end up undermining our single-greatest achievement since Independence - Democracy.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar does one thing well ' keep going back to Nehru, Rajiv era - he is one stooge of the family. With his eloquent english - he weaves a web but is never able togive a solution - except to say "panchayat raj" is the solution for all problems. He is a man I  time warp.. colored by his 2tone glasses.<br/><br/>
I read his article for the humour I get out of his obeisance &amp; the arguments he uses to defend the supremely democratic "family" called congress! Outside of that - his value is less than the piece of paper ! Maybe NDtv shoulxmove his column to humour section.

                            More nonsense from this old guy.. Hardik Patel wanted to be in the limelight and wants to get benefits using the same old Congress strategy - OBC reservations.. The strategy used by the Congress junk to get re-elected during the MMS second term - remember the dead-and-gone Arjun Singh? The corrupt guy (also the friend of Union Carbide!) who pushed OBC reservation in all categories. And now this talks big things!!

                            Rajiv was a really straight forward man with dreams. But he had these useless advisors like Mani, tiwari, arjun, ansari.. who misguided him for everything... starting from Shahbano to ayodhya.. He could not gauge the rise of BJP and BSP which basically dealt a death blow to congress in UP and other Northern states. Had he allowed ledaers like Rajesh pilot, Arif Mohammed Khan, situation would have been different. Sycophants like Mani are responsible for what congress is today.

                            The truth is Maniji is a big burden to Congress and a big liability and headache. 100% sure Hardik patel is much accomplished and useful than highly educated bookish Maniji. Feel sorry for congress as great leaders like Chidambaram. Maniji , Digvijay are scared to pitch in to be the President if congress , Vice President and  PM candidates . Even Rahulji is scared if the PM post. Surely Hardik patel is better than them

Not one of the Modi bhakts has the brains to think about the larger society. The only thing now left for Modi is to carry a guitar everytime he goes out on a foreign trip. As of now, he resembles a singer performing on the stage than the PM of a great nation.<br/><br/>

                            Reservation system was created by who? The constitution called for abolishing the reservation system after 10-15 years, but who perpetuated this blatantly discriminatory system for vote-bank politics?<br/><br/>
That is the root cause - in a country, the equal citizens are treated unequally.<br/><br/>
MSA's masters - mostly Rajiv - must be on the hook for this malaise. For ever.<br/><br/>
What we see now is the symptom of such distortion. MSA may rejoice at the fire being hurled at Modi today; but this ignorant wise does not know he is going to be wrapped in the same fire the next minute.

                            Mani the Congress is the only culprit who sowed the seeds of reservation to get vote Bank. This is not against Modi or Gujrat Govt its against Congress policies which divided people on cast basis. The best thing to unprivileged is to give them best living. But congress made them inefficient by giving reservation. Even those who already come to main stream are still getting advantage of reservation. This was the main reason of this Patel agitation. And as evident he belongs to AAP so it  it is more obvious that it was deliberately instigated.

                            Congress governments did not industrialize India sufficiently, that is the reason we are facing so much problems today. The raw materials was being exported to foreign countries without setting up processing units in India, which could have generated millions of Jobs and lively hood for millions. Even today the export of raw materials is going on, Modi is trying to stop in by his policy of "Make in India". Land is required to setup industries. I will give you one simple example, there was a mining company called Kuduremukh Iron ore Ltd, which extracted iron ore from Western ghat hills and exported raw Iron ore to Japan at dirt cheap price. The whole Kuduremukh hill was dug up and exported. <br/>
Nehru and Indira are the one who are responsible for this sorry state of affairs India is facing today. Modi may or may not change the situation, but this Mani do not have any moral ground to open his mount to praise the dirty dynasty.

                            Dear Mani Shankar ji I am a supporter of the congress though not a member and I am a great admirer of Oomen Chandy. Reservation would not have created this much problem if you had made it mandatory that irrespective of caste you have to score top marks like above 97% for admission to medical colleges. I will tell you why. I was brought up in a public sector township in Tamilnadu. My parents though FC where working as ordinary workers and I happened to study along with children of big officers of the kind that received salutes from the police, CISF. These children got low marks, but they could garner seats in government colleges because of the reservation policy. While I an FC and a child of a worker could only get a seat through capitation fees. Why should the child of an top ranking officer get a government seat based on reservation.?

                            The real Problem is that the whole reservation is a Big problem In India. When you get a admission to a Medical school for just 60% of marks and the other person can't get in even after scoring 90% this things are bound to happen. It will happen more and more. In my view the whole reservation should be abolished now. But who is gone do it, the politician are all corrupt in India.

                            Mr.Mani Shankar Iyer has the skill of turning any subject to criticize Mr.Modi. Don't know why this kind of Animosity.May be Mr.Modi kept them out of power. Naturally "Tall the Scams, bigger the fall" in his own words.What some people told me was that RESERVATION SYSTEM was introduced for initial period of some years only to bring up some communities from Social backwardness. Instead of discontinuing after that specified period,the so called Democratic Governments (mostly ruled by Mr.Mani's party)prefered to continue this system as part of vote bank politics.Had it been discontinued at initial stages, it would have been better.At plant stage it will be easier to pluck rather than at the stage of big tree level.Slowly, to take advantage of votes more and more people were brought into reservation protection.Is it not injustice to Merit and Economically weaker sections of people who by cast do not qualify? Mr.Hardik patel wants Reservations to NONE as long long years of reservation support was given and stage has come to do away with Reservation System. I do not support any reservation system on cast or any community basis as of today.In my personal opinion,Enough rope was given for upbringing on cast basis and it is time to review the system and STRENGTHEN ALL ECONOMICALLY BACKWARD COMMUNITIES IRRESPECTIVE OF CAST OR CREED.OTHERWISE, totally DISCONTINUE THIS RESERVATION SYSTEM.(WHICH NO POLITICAL PARTY WILL AGREE)

No need to poke your slimy oar into things that do not concern you. You are a Tamilian unwanted in Tamil Nadu. Better find historical answers as to why Congress got 44 out of 542 seats in Lok Sabha. Then bother about others and their problems. Sycophancy is your forte. Better stick to it. Do not load your pea brain by trying to find solutions to weighty problems.

@Ravindra K P: I am from Gujarat. Fact is that media is making and projecting Hardik Patel is much larger than what he is.<br/><br/>
Reality is that whole so called Patel agitation started in Gujarat (North Gujarat in Mehshan Districts)in July with small rally &amp; protests. Hardik Patel was just face of this. Few MLAs of BJP who are also ministers in Gujarat cabinet were behind this and aim of protest was to make Patel (who are die hard supporter of Modi &amp; BJP) against BJP in coming Corporations elections due in October November 2015. Any loss in these elections would have make Anandhiben Patel's CM chair unstable and so called No.2 in Gujarat Cabinet would have appointed as CM.<br/><br/>
Now this was original plan but as protest started, strong anti-modi lobby of Keshubhai Patel (who tried to defeat Modi in 2007 &amp; 2012)and Congress too have joined this hidden way and only aim to destabilize Anandiben Patel government. And after this, protest was out of BJP MLAs who originally started it due to internal rivalry of BJP.<br/><br/>
Riots &amp; violence were also pre-planned so protest can continue and Patel goes completely against BJP due to police action on protesters. <br/><br/>
When moment started and became larger, many people specially from upper caste people had sympathy for it due to there loss in college admission &amp; government job due to quota system. But after Ahmedabad rally, most Gujarati including Patel understood that this was basically politics and nothing with real issue of reservation.<br/><br/>
So Hardik Patel has lost his relevance now. Only media is making him larger. Now onwards this protest would gradually going down in Gujarat if media would not add there fuel into it. No one wants riots , violence. What we (Gujarti) progressed last 12 years and peace was major reason behind this.

Instead of aiming for higher, we are looking at going backwards , we  want money and fame without any hard work in the name of reservation!! Tell me Mr. Mani, would you ever consider going to some BC or OBC doctor or hire a nurse?? How does it help India in the long run? Its time we looked forward and not politicise this situation. A rally just to be termed as a "backward class" is horrifying and shameful. Instead of sitting down with the in power party to sort out this situation , you point fingers!! Shows how much you care about India :P<br/><br/>
Acche din kaise aayenge with people like you. I think India would still be safer with Pakistan as an enemy but with people like you in the cabinet, Acche din tho bhool hi jaooo.. Rather than pointing fingers at Modi, try doing something to rectify the situation. By saying Modi is bad, doesnt make you any better.<br/>
Again, its a shame India has to choose between Bad and Worse, rather than good and better in politics!!!

Unfortunately for congress, Rahul just does not measure up and advisers like you have been the cause for Congress' electoral failure and will continue to be so.

Did absolutely nothing than to build connections with the Gandhi's. We will be quite better off without him. Half a century of Congress rule and this is the position we are in. He is as much responsible for India's problems as any other two faced congressman. Except criticising BJP &amp; RSS, this man has accomplished nothing in his life but has given a oppressor to progress and development in this country.Its bizarre that he keeps talking about Poverty, Tribals poor lives when he &amp; his party are directly responsible for their condition. What you did in your 50 years. Why question now. For god sake or no god sake, stop talking.

                            @Ravindra K P: I bet you haven't read Mani's article. In fact, if you read the article carefully you will find many points on whose basis you can pin down the Congress. If without reading Mani's article you hastily cut and paste your comment here, then you are also a man in time wrap

                            I never even bother reading Mani's article instead come straight to the comments section. Here is one man who has some intelligence that is completely ruined by the sycophancy to the family that does not allow him to see any other view except for his masters. There were so many flaws of the Nehru-Gandhi family and you cannot treat it as divine.. Accept that they made mistakes and try to learn from it will help the congress better else Mani will die an bitter old man while the whole world has moved on.

                            It surely is a monologue on a Pundit on Anti Modism. A non entity propped by a few disgruntled members of the Patel community is being feted by the National media as the next big thing in Indian Politics. Poor thing does not even have a coherent plan and a convincing case. However he will survive in the media till a new Anti Modi point is discovered. Let him enjoy his small time in the sun.
