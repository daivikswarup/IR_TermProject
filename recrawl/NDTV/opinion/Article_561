Headline::::We're Stuck With RaGa's In-Between-Vacations Avatar



DateTime::::2015-05-12T22:38:00+05:30




                                The Congress scion Rahul Gandhi may have returned back to his home after a 58-day vacation, but the question is, is he really back? I mean back to the fold of real politics. I doubt it - and have very compelling reasons of thinking so. 
The last few years of UPA-II were detrimental both for the government as well as the organisation of the Congress. The Heads of both institutions, the government as well as the Congress, were literally ridiculed. In politics, you are likely to be loved or hated in extreme measures, but to be ridiculed for a substantial span of time by a substantially large segment of the population is something no politician can afford. That's were Rahul Gandhi delivered a beating for Manmohan Singh, who was ridiculed for the fact that despite being an economist of repute, he meekly surrendered to 10 Janpath (the home of Rahul's mother, Sonia Gandhi).  
Rahul championed the brand of episodic political somersaults. Rahul's way of politics can be aptly called "Scripted Politics" - as if it were a play and the actor played his role as per a written script, then  got disinterested and reverted to his original self. This the Congress called "Private Vacations". Now that the rejuvenated actor is back home, he does perform his antics with some vigor - but till the next phase of boredom sets in. So today's Rahul is the "Rahul between vacations".
Over the course of time, what became clear was that Rahul and responsibility are divorced concepts. For reasons best known to him, Rahul always shrugged off responsibility. It took a lot of cajoling to bring him to the Congress organisational gamut. He never took up any portfolio in Manmohan Singh's cabinet to showcase his penchant or putative ability for doing things differently. He never took any issue which he raised to logical conclusion. From Kalavati to Bhatta Parsol, from managing the UP assembly elections to utterances like "Nonsense Ordinance", most of Rahul's performances earned him the reputation of a "Fly-by-Night" politician.
A member of a Parliament who, till recently, had only spoken thrice in 11 years, whose attendance in Parliament was abysmally low, whose performance in the organisation left murmurs of discontent within his own party men - yet, Rahul is still called a politician and raging debates are held on the possible impact of his return only because of the fact that some are still suffering from a Dynasty Hangover. No other politician would have been given these many chances to prove oneself after hitting repeated disasters. Not even in the Congress, which has handed over an empty field to Rahul Gandhi for net practice.
Politics can never be a "Part Time Job". It's an All or None Profession. There is no "At My Convenience" in politics. You have to be there when you are needed the most. When unseasonal and unfortunate hail storms were destroying acres of crops, Rahul was vacationing. He returned per his convenience to address a rally of farmers in Delhi. When catastrophe hit Uttarakhand two years back, Rahul was vacationing. He returned per his convenience to flag off the relief materials. This is what makes Rahul a Reluctant and Part-Time Politician.
After rubbishing Social Media for all these years, RaGa has been finally forced to join Twitter. It just exposes that he lacks the politician's must-have ability of foresight. Sadly, Rahul could not foresee and predict the importance of the Social Media as many others could. This inability to do the right things at the right time is what he has repeatedly displayed. 
The over-enthusiasm displayed by Rahul after his return has earned him the tag of a "Rent-a-cause" politician. Rahul's return at best has evoked a sense of temporally well-being in the Congress which had developed cold sweat thinking of a Congress sans the Gandhi family. It has definitely gifted some masala for prime time TV debates, which were otherwise becoming boring without any story of scam and scamsters in the first year of the BJP governance. 
Rahul should remain worried about the point he is trying to prove, not to the nation or the government, but to the Congress - that contrary to what most of you think, I am still in the running for Congress President. As far as the nation is concerned, we all are aware that the next vacation is fast approaching - may be beginning from 19th June, for Rahul has hardly ever celebrated his birthday at his Home. Where ever... Happy Birthday in advance!(Sambit Patra is national spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a renowned surgeon.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Sambit - did you read your piece at least once before publishing? if you did, didn't you feel ashamed? apart from personal attacks is there anything of value in your blog? you should have known by now (by your pathetic shouting tactics on TV and idiotic blogs like these) that very existence on earth is a joke.

                            Its ok we dont care RaGa , neither should you be! concentrate on Bihar elections , GST, Land bill , economy and act to check the honesty of judges and prosecuters . <br/><br/>
=&gt; RaGa has full potential to be PM as the present government is seeing decline in faith. And then we will have scripted PM !

He specializes in the subject Rahul Gandhi....and I believe it's time he moves on from that and concentrates on real issues... Otherwise his 'subject' will end up having the last laugh !!! Time to grow up and move on !!!

Tell us the truth--ARE U SCARED OF RAHUL--Rahul was not holding any position when he was on vacation, then what is the problem in you in writing this article. Ite seems that BJP spokesmen are scared. Your i year rule had paved the way easier for Rahul.This article is only a personal attack and nothing good. Please think when u are free with a free mind. Dont worry there is a chance for you also to become a minister IF your GOD wishes --like Ms Irani , Ms Nirmala etc ( because they were very hardly defending your party before the elections )

Whatever questions you guys are asked ,you reply by talking of Rahul. This is especially true for you and Nalin Kohli. Believe me, people are getting fed up of these personal attacks. Remember , the honeymoon doesn't last forever. Looks like you guys are getting nervous at Raga 2.0 version

                            BJP is still behaving like the same old pathetic opposition party. Ridiculing others won't help you in the long run. You are getting the dose of your own medicine actually. Smriti Irani is visting Amethi for no reason at all. Now this Patra is here for personal mud slinging. Both of them are more interested in RaGa's vacations, You and firebrand(for no reason) Irani looks to me more novice than RaGa.

                            People of the nation are noticing that the entire BJP is working against one individual Rahul Gandhi. If they think he is so useless and he is somebody who can be dismissed why are they attaching so much importance to whatever he says and why do they have to criticize everything about him be it a short vacation of vipasana or meeting some poor people to reassure them that there are people to take care of them. Sambit patra stop personal attacks and concentration to argue about ideology and principles. Remember People of watching. The more you insult, ridcule and defame Rahu,l the more he will be loved by the people.

                            The text is a very clear indication of the intellectual level of Mr. Patra, where he uses the old and outdated strategy of shooting the messenger. This is also what he does in every debate with such a loud voice. people are sick with this kind of finger pointing, which applies to all political parties. Media is also to be blamed to make such discussions personal. By continuing with Mr. Patra for such a long time as their spokes person, I understand that BJP is also aligned to his high decibel zero-content non-stop uttering. Hope to hear some reasonable argument from BJP, not just Congress bashing.

                            Sambit. You are sounding more and more like Pappu. Remember that Arnab interview wherein to each question, RaGa responded - RTI, women empowerment, family blah blah?<br/><br/>
Now, to each question on BJP's / Modi's (non) performance, your stock response is RaGa!<br/><br/>
You think so much of RaGa that you have become like him

Shame on all those  who are supporting  this kid  called  "RaGa".  These guys don't have shame to support the fake family whose only ambition is to stick to power and not allow anybody to become the leader in the party.<br/>
What other qualification or experience does this fake gandhi has except being the great grandson of Nehru ? Shame Shame Shame !!!!!!!

                            Mr. Sambit Patra has displayed his nervousness if not his party's on the recent unexpected resurgence of Rahul Gandhi. It is too early to say how Rahul and his party will resurrect itself, but at least they are doing something. By wasting so much of space and time to rant about RG he should realise that he is only helping his opponent. Lest he forget the Congress did this mistake by focusing too much on Mr. Narendra Modi who used it to build his persona to become bigger than any other leader in BJP and ultimately the Prime Minister... Sambit should not unwittingly let history not repeat itself to his own peril.

                            All negative comments have been posted for Mr. Patra. But truth is truth though bitter!  His comments are unaccepted by selfish people who are easily ignoring the facts and misleading others. For political gain , RaGa has started new 'zoot' and 'soot' campaign against Modi. But we know he is a runner,not politician:)

                            After the win in Delhi, Rahul had said that there is a lot for the Congress to learn from AAP. Whether the Congress learned anything is a moot point. But Rahul has totally copied Kejriwal's tactics after his 58 day "Chintan" or Vipassana or whatever:  "Shoot, scoot and pass on to another topic; do not bother to explain or answer anything".

                            Let Rahul say what he wants. Counter him with facts. That is the easy thing to do because everything that RAGA says is either lies or misleading statements because he speaks what's handed over to him by his chamcha and he fails to cross check if what he is supposed to say is the fact. That's why on both net neutrality &amp; Amethi Food park he has fallen flat on his face.<br/><br/>
Politics is all about perceptions. By saying things like pro-corporate, anti-farmer, suit-boot sarkar repeatedly, RAGA is successfully creating a perception in the minds of most people that this govt is for corporates. Govt should counter that with facts. <br/><br/>
Govt should counter his nonsense on land acquisition bill with facts. Instead, BJP keeps harping on his vacation. We all know about his vacation, lets not overdo that.<br/><br/>
Most of what RAGA is saying is to prove to the congress that he is here to lead. That is why facts &amp; truth are liberally used. It's not about facts, its about launching his career. Congress will of course, cheer any nonsense he says. Govt should calmly tell the country the facts. In 2019, Indian's are going to vote for the next government not just congress people.

                            It is a fair and an accurate summary of Rahul Gandhi's performance. Indeed, I imagine the whole country is used to it by now, surely. The man is not interested in politics, that is the long and short of it. If he is not interested there is absolutely no shame in it. He should pursue what excites him. At least, unlike most of the Indian folk, he has the opportunity to do so. Most are hampered by lack of financial independence. What will be terrible both for Congress and particularly himself is to keep digging and get nowhere, in spite of Congress's love affair with monarchical politics rather than merit driven individuals.

                            It is pertinent to mention - Congress party is doing disservice to itself by unjustly glorifying anything Raul does thus only encouraging him to play for the gallery immaturely rather than mould himself as a dignified Statesman. Short-term acclaims &amp; applauds only spoil the much-needed long-term foundation.
