Headline::::Our Politicians Loved Section 66(A)

	What do Narendra Modi and Azam Khan, Karti Chidambaram and Mamata Banerjee have in common? The law will no longer allow someone to be arrested for writing an online comment that offends or annoys them. In a landmark ruling that is a shot in the arm for freedom of expression in India, the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down as unconstitutional a key provision of the Information Technology Act that criminalises speech on the internet that is otherwise perfectly legal were it to be made on television, in a newspaper, or at a public gathering.
	A bench of Justices Chelameshwar and Rohinton Nariman found the provisions of Section 66A vague and confusing and so liable to abuse that they ordered its deletion.
	The offending section prescribed a punishment of three years for any person who uses a "computer resource" or "communication device" to send
	(a) "any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character",
	(b) "any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will..."
	(c)  any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages."
	Thanks to these loose legal provisions, Devu Chodankar was booked by the police in Goa last year for a Facebook post in which he feared Modi would unleash a "holocaust" if elected Prime Minister. Ravi Srinivasan was arrested in Puducherry for tweeting "got reports that karthick chidambaram has amassed more wealth than vadra." Vicky Khan, a class XI student, was arrested for reproducing a quote wrongly attributed to the Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan. And Ambikesh Mahapatra, a Kolkata professor, was charged for circulating a cartoon of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that the police said was offensive.
	The irony is that none of these statements which the IT Act sought to criminalise fell under the purview of the "reasonable restrictions" that Article 19(2) of the Constitution imposes on the right to free speech. Besides sanctions envisaged by the laws of contempt and defamation, the freedom of expression in India can be restricted only "in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality," or if it involves incitement to an offence.
	Until 2009, when the Manmohan Singh government smuggled Section 66A into the IT Act, these were the only limits placed on the right of a citizen to speak freely using any medium.
	What the offending section did was to not only render precarious the development of social media - a freewheeling space where informal discussion on current affairs is the norm - but it represented a long-term threat to the functioning of traditional media too. After all, most newspapers and TV channels have websites where they upload their content. Section 66A meant that content which was otherwise protected as long it was printed or broadcast could be targeted for legal action if it were made available online.
	By upholding the paramountcy of the Constitutional provisions on free speech, the Supreme Court has effectively restored the status quo ante, extending the same protections regardless of the medium through which citizens choose to express themselves.
	The court wisely disregarded the assurances given by the Narendra Modi government and its UPA predecessor that official safeguards were in place to guard against Section 66A's "misuse". The irony is that these "safeguards" were not enough to prevent young Vicky Khan from being arrested, a fact that must have been noticed by the bench as it was preparing its verdict.
	The court also said it would read down Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act which makes "intermediaries" like internet service providers (ISPs) liable for punishment if they fail to "expeditiously remove or disable access to" material that is considered unlawful, such as posts which may fall foul of Section 66A or other laws, "upon receiving actual knowledge" or an official notification about this. This provision has had a chilling effect on free speech online, especially by activists and marginalized groups, as ISPs have tended to be highly risk-averse, and would rather delete supposedly offensive content upon receiving complaints rather than falling foul of the law themselves.  
	Even as free speech advocates applaud the boldness of the Supreme Court, it is worth remembering how most political parties have fought hard to retain Section 66A and other offensive parts of the IT Act.
	When examples began to surface during the UPA years about the manner in which Section 66A was being used to harass ordinary internet users, Modi declared himself in favour of free speech and even changed his DP on twitter to black to convey his opposition to censorship. But in arguments before the Supreme Court, his government did a U-turn and argued strongly in favour of retaining the power to criminalise online speech.
	Though over-zealous policemen can no longer invoke Section 66A to please their political masters, thin-skinned politicians still have other weapons in their armoury to harass or silence critics. Criminal defamation is one such method. Or filing frivolous complaints about promoting enmity between groups. Most of these charges eventually get thrown out, but the legal proceedings take time and the process itself becomes the punishment.
	In an ideal world, our politicians will read the Supreme Court order and realize the need to be more tolerant of free speech, especially speech that is laced with sarcasm, wit, irony and criticism. But this is the real world, so please forgive me if I am not holding my breath.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            While the politicians have no doubt misused this law to intimidate ordinary citizens, there are also others who are guilty of the same crime. Recently a friend in Chennai was subject to this law for a Facebook post on his experience in a Corporate Hospital where he had taken his mother for treatment. He had to go into hiding and negotiate a truce through his lawyer which needed him to remove the post immediately and give an undertaking that he can be put behind bars if he repeated his offence....."Writing about a bad experience in the hospital and advising others to not go to this hospital for treatment". I am sure these guys are planning a new law to replace this and retain the privileges of 66A

                            From which corner of world Modi come into this? There was never a case of anybody being harassed for criticizing Modi ever during his 12  years as CM in Gujarat, nor there is any case during his PM stint. He in fact had criticized 66A when it was introduced by Sibal during UPA rule as social media was exposing UPA. Stop Modi hatred that you blatantly drag him into this without him ever involved in this.

                            The thugs who made the law knew exactly what it means and designed it for their use. There are many more such laws that need to be scarpped. Sometimes one thinks that if the parliament does not function ( the way it has been the last few years) we are better off!

                            Article is full of Hippocratic arguments<br/>
1) The title "Our politicians.." does not sound right at all, It should have been "Indian politicians, or politicians.." because Siddhartha is not Indian.<br/>
2) Even if Policemen are zealous or over-zealous, they cant do anything unless anyone files complaint against the posts. So why blame policemen only?<br/>
3) Article takes no time to point out our Prime minister Modi, but missed to mention who filed case against Chandukar. Ohh.. wait a minute he is big guy from business community "Industrialist and former confederation of Indian industries (CII) state president Atul Pai Kane" and Siddhartha already blamed policemen for the same.

                            While even Chidambaram, whose party framed the law, has welcomed the decision saying that it was poorly drafted (by whom?), the JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, has criticised it. He perhaps believes that as he can exercise 'his' freedom of expression by  saying whatever he wants in the safe and secure Rajya Sabha as no one can challenge him on remarks made inside the House,  common citizens should be denied this right and punished if they venture to express their opinion on politicians. What hypocrisy !

                            While it is good that a law which got misused more often than not was struck down, the bigger issue is that the police do get influenced by politicians like Azam Khan. They will find some way or other to tackle citizens that annoy politicians. However the facts remain that so called pseudo-secular brigade starting from Derek O'brien, Vishal and so many others have been engaging name calling for decades but they hardly shed a tear if Hindus die.

                            Maybe now NDTV can tell us whether the allegation about Mr Chidambaram's son is true. Also, it should be possible to publish details of Mr Vadra's exploits.
