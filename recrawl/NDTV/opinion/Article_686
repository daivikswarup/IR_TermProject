Headline::::AAP's 500-Crore Ad Budget is Far From Excessive



DateTime::::2015-07-03T14:48:00+05:30




                                I should be angry but I am not, though I'd like to ask why every AAP decision is so aggressively highlighted, with it often being turned intoÂ  aÂ  "sin". Is this because AAP is an exotic commodity which attracts both friend and foes, orÂ  is it because there is a section within the establishment who wantsÂ  AAP projected in a bad light to further its political interest ? Or is it because the interest of the media is so lopsided that it tends to forget that there is a world which exists outside Delhi too, where more than 100 men die from toxic alcohol and nobody seems to care very much?
So I fail to understand why the media and other political leaders in the wilderness find a great scoop in the new Publicity budget of the Delhi government. It is just because for once we have a budget earmarked in the most transparent manner with a commitment to account for every penny spent? What is so scandalous or sensational about it? There is no denying the fact that that budget has been increased many fold to 500 crores, but that is the outer limit which the government can spend; it doesn't mean the government will end up spending as much. Is it a crime for a legitimately- elected government to spend money to inform the millions who elected them on how promises made during the campaign are being delivered?
In a democratic set-up, it is incumbent on the government to inform people about the work done so that people can make informed choices as and when required. In a democracy, it is ultimately the people who are the final arbiter. It is in the fitness of democracy that the government maintain live communication with the people, and the sovereign will of the people must keep the government on edge. And this is only possible if the government of the day as a matter of routine keeps people aware of its workings and about the decisions taken on a daily basis. This will strengthen consultative democracy which AAP has promised from the day one. Yes, this will require money, but it's a small price to make governance transparent and accountable.
May I also ask how many in the media and the critics have appreciated the budget-making process of the AAP government? The Delhi government led by Arvind Kejriwal chose 12 assembly constituencies which acted as a laboratory for consultative democracy. In all these constituencies, the local MLA and government officials involved in budget-making had gone to the people and asked their opinion on what should be done in the budget. People participated with great enthusiasm. The result has been excellent and by next year, the idea will be to take this great experiment to every constituency. More exhaustive consultation with the people will be initiated for making the budget. In the truest sense, this will be a budget by the people for the people, not a budget by experts for experts. This does not mean that expert opinion will be ignored. Certainly not, but the input of the people will help shape a more lively and organic budget which in the final analysis will strengthen democracy.
This is exactly what AAP had done during the campaign through its most innovative concept, Delhi Dialogues- townhalls in every neighbourhood. AAP made a paradigm shift. Manifesto-making was not restricted to a few individuals sitting in AC rooms who would produce a thick document which would then be released at a press conference before being thrown into a dust bin. AAP spent three months, went to every possible stake-holder of Democracy and consulted them about what should be included in the manifesto. This was democracy at its best.
I don't know how many of you have noticed that AAP government in its maiden budget has increased the education budget by 106 per cent, which no other government has done till now. In the same budget, allocation for Health also been improved by 45 per cent, another record. Conventional politics and parties had not attempted this. These are transformative steps because AAP believes that as a country, we are focusing too much on physical infrastructure and ignoring human capital. AAP is of the firm belief that unless we create human infrastructure, physical infrastructure will not yield the desired result and the whole reform exercise will lack essential equilibrium. India cannot be a great country and a super power unless as a nation we create a balance between quality human capital and physical infrastructure.
Â 
The publicity budget is also a vital component of the same philosophy; if looked at in isolation, it may cause a little unease, but if seen from a different perspective, one will find logic behind it. There is a strong thread running from the pre-elections days to now, and the purpose is to make democracy more transparent and accountable and make people constantly informed so that they can judge the functioning of the government; then, if required, they can make an intervention for the betterment of the society. And if this makes our democracy and governance more robust, then this is a small price and we all should not mind paying it.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

AAP has increased ad budget by 2000% yes 2000% up from some 20cr per year to 526cr per year. <br/>
Plus AAP has appointed 21 MLA's as PS with 1 lac/month and house car security benifits. <br/>
Plus approx 200 AAP workers have been hired by delhi govt with a salary of 20k-1.5lac/month.<br/>
And when MCD workers ask for salary......Kejriwal says go ask Modi.

                            I am amazed at the brazenness of the language used by Ashutosh. I was a backed of Arvind but slowly I am realizing is that not only he is simply incapable of good governance but is also unwilling to give good governance. Ashutosh says that they went to people and people wanted more budget for advertising. Whom are you fooling Ashutosh. People want clean streets, efficient public transport, good water supply, regular electricity.. They don't want to see the faces of AAP looking down upon them from all nooks and corners. You talk of transparency but in your statement you have not even once mentioned waht were the previous budgets for publicity or how the money has been used or is being planed to be used. STOP FOOLING PEOPLE ASHUTOSH and company. WE ARE NOT FOOLS.

Why can't AAP spend it's own money?? AAP has one standard for itself and another for BJP. Hypocrisy at its pinnacle indeed.

                            Stop looking for constant appreciation from everyone. You emoting like this only worsens the damage caused by this story. Try to not react to evrything.  That's a lesson you can learn from Modi and other seasoned politicians. Like in the case of #Lalitgate, he is yet to say anything on it, but with time,  the scandal itself lost focus with everyone from media Chiefs to crickets now implicated by Modi. The media, as expected, I have moved on to other things like the air India issue.  Don't over-react, it only feeds the TRP hungry media.

                            Ashutosh Ji,<br/><br/>
Few points:<br/><br/>
(a) I don't think your writings are helping AAP. They are not convincing and actually every time expose another weakness of AAP. It will help if you stop.<br/><br/>
(b) Generally - Do you and Arvind Ji think that the people are idiots? They were wise when they elected you and they shall remain wise to discard attempts to manufacture support/ mandate through ads.<br/><br/>
(c) I haven't read AAP's budget is any great detail, but of whatever I have gathered from news reports and some other more reliable sources, I think the budget has its priority at the right place and should be commended.<br/><br/>
(d) Secondly, I quite agree that it appears that a large section of Media is biased against AAP. Yet slowly as media (say some channels) are gathering courage to start questioning the Modi government (probably mostly out of their inherent ideological stand), theyr are more balanced in their approach towards AAP.<br/><br/>
(e) Now on some substance of your article:<br/><br/>
(i)  So Rs. 500 crore is the outer limit for the money that may be spent on ads, it is not what the government may really intend to spend. Sounds dangerous - because it mean that the amounts allocated for expenditure on education, health, roads and subsidies are the maximum that can be spent but it is not necessary that the government really intends to spend that much! Advise: Poor logic and by the same logic it jeopardizes the rest of the budget.<br/><br/>
(ii) So the Ad spend is really to make people aware of the "policies" of the government. Frankly, your ads till now have only been an ode to Mr. Kejriwal. None of your popular ads appear to enlighten the janta about the government's policy. Your ads are not educative or informative but only self congratulatory. Really there is no difference between the large print and electronic media ads that we see of Akhilesh yadav's government all over and your government's ads. Since you believe such ads are making democracy more transparent and participatory, we would very much like to hear some words of appreciation from you for the wonderful work which is being done in this regard by other leaders like, Akhilesh Yadav ji, Jayalalita Ji, Shivraj Singh Chauhan Ji and so many others.<br/><br/>
(iii) By giving such ads, your government is indulging in deceit and breach of law of the worst kind. I am sure you are aware of the recent Supreme court judgment. Yes the judgment omitted to say that names of the chief minister or other ministers cannot be mentioned and in express terms it only said that their photos cannot be displayed. So you conveniently, kept mentioning the name of your chief minister in your ads (print and electronic) without showing his photo. Please pause for a minute and understand - what was the spirit and intent of the judgment of the Supreme Court. It was that you cannot use public money to promote private individuals and their cult. By taking advantage of a loophole in the judgment you have really mocked the spirit of the judgment, which, being a pronouncement by the Supreme Court, is the law of the Land.<br/><br/>
(iv) while making the budget you did a few mohalla sabha meetings, took feed back and made your budget - why not deploy the same method for informing the people about your policies? In any case, traditionally that was the way the connect with the people and channels  of communication with the people were kept open.<br/><br/>
(v) Also, since your avowed purpose behind your ads is to inform the people of delhi about the policies of the Government of Delhi, Kindly ensure that you target only Delhi specific media. Your ads on national channel will cost far far more because they have a pan India viewership and therefore the cost of their airtime will be far more, and if the Delhi government starts paying for ads targeted at Delhi electorate on an all india basis rate, then it is unwise, wasteful and probably criminal. With your avowed purpose, You cannot use Delhi's money to spread awareness about your party and government in rest of India.<br/><br/>
Lastly, just a personal question: You left a lucrative job. In all these ads the only one being promoted is Arvind Kejriwal - so really there is not much hope for others to flourish and become meaningful in that way. that leaves us with your avowed stance that you joined politics so that you could contribute to changing the nature of political discourse and engagement in India. I do believe that those were your intentions - but if that be so, how can you compromise (and top of it through your weekly writings justify) with AAP turning into another ugly face in the same old rotten political drama.<br/><br/>
Also, I hope a few years or months down the line, I don't see you criticizing AAP or getting out of AAP on the ground that AAP has deviated from its course - whereas what might have actually happened is that you might have found that the benefits of sucking upto Kejriwal are not good enough and there is no place for anybody else's political ambitions in AAP.<br/><br/>
All the best anyways!

 They Should also give some commitment of free home and Food also. Then there will be no need for education and doing jobs also.<br/><br/>
Lack of experience will bring down delhi people very soon. Already people are telling that " Boss take more money but give some water atleast". And this will continue if delhi people continues for more free commodities...

                            To begin with, it is not Aap`s Budget as stated by Ashutosh ji. We hv no issue if Aap spends that much by collecting funds. These AAP fellows think Govt is AAP &amp; AAP is Govt. People comment on Govt &amp; party jumps to reply like Govt spokes persons. This mixing of party and govt is facist (recall Bath party).<br/><br/>
Ashutosh ji`s comment on informed decision by public can be accepted if the advts are only about how to avail public welfare schemes but if these are Om Jai Kehriwal Hare, it is corruption to promote yourself.<br/><br/>
Another issue is comparision with unke longon ka budget dekho, unka bijli ka bill dekho.... Are bhai, vo sab ye karte the, chor the, tabhi to aapko chuna. Now, you say we do because they do.

                            Now Aap leaders claim that the advertisement budget which has seen a whopping raise from Rs 28 crores to 526 crores is far from excessive. Very obviously, the news channel owners and newspaper owners will be more than happy, but there is no way to justify this. Especially they are proud to  raise the education budget by 2 times why are they not proud of increasing the ad budget by over 21 times? is there any other head under which such a sharp (is it the right word?) raise has been provisioned by AAP Govt? Obviously looks an attempt to bribe the media!

                            For god's sake, Mr Ashutosh, please write articles substantiated quantitatively. No justice given to your title. Had you given a comparison report of Delhi govt's current earmarked amount vs the money spent in government advertisements in other states, Mann Ki Baat etc., vs money spent by the previous Delhi government - then it would have helped us to understand the issue relatively. <br/><br/>
You need to present this in a relative way, on what is norm and how much its above or below the norm. And if not, you should at least give information that "public really wanted you to spend 500 cr on advertisements". <br/><br/>
Without explaining all these things, why did you choose to give the title, "AAP's 500-Crore Ad Budget is Far From Excessive?" <br/><br/>
You're making life difficult for AAP supporters these days.

                            If your excuse is that it takes 500 crores to publicise the achievements of AAP government, how much did you spent to get 67/70 majority? People who voted you into power are wise enough to see and judge for themselves what good you are doing for them. This extravagant budget for a tiny state has no justification. You could even launch a couple of television channels with this money and run it for a year.

Worse, the 500+ crore advertising budget is likely to be spend to promote your party supremo Arvind Kejriwal. Do we pay taxes for this?

If for 7 Lok Sabha Seats, the expenditure for Publicity is Rs 526 Crore, then for 543 Seats will be Rs 41,000Crore for all the states put together. And if Central Govt also puts Rs41,000Crore , then total publicity expense will be Rs 82,000Crore.<br/>
Yes, Ashutosh and Arvind Kesriwal are KHAS AADMI

                            AAP wants to spend more then Rs 500 crs on Advertising. Ashutosh very efficiently mentions the percentage increase in Education &amp; Health budget, but skips the percentage increase in Adv. budget. Also he mentions that this is the outer limit &amp; may not be spent. So isn't it the same case for education &amp; health. You hv fixed the outer limit &amp; may not be actually spent, they why taking applauds for increasing the budget for the same. Ashutosh, ur write-ups &amp; shameful defence of Kejriwal speech after the farmer suicide &amp; Tomar is reducing ur support base drastically.

                            Ashutoshji!Just listen to Suraiya's Song:<br/>
"Sochaatha kya, kyaa hogayaa?<br/>
Apna jisey samjhethey hum, afsous woh apna na thaa!<br/>
Ghairoanki ismay kya khataa?Karthey hain apnoan say geela!<br/>
Aiy dil na ro, hairaan na ho!Honatha jo woh hogayaa!<br/>
Ronay say ab kya faaida?Kya hogayaa,kya hogaya?<br/>
Jo kuch bhi dekha khwaab thaa,is khwaab ko bhool jaa"!!

                            Mr. Asutosh asks - Is it a crime for a legitimately- elected government to spend money to inform the millions who elected them on how promises made during the campaign are being delivered?  We ask - Is it a crime for the public, media, court and the opposition party to ask the Government so much has been allocated for advertisement ?  The biggest problem with AAP - they have exclusive right to be angry , they exclusive right to critizize anyone , they exclusive right to keep blaming others for all their failure , they have exclusive right to use derogatory names to public servents - But no other person has right question them. <br/>
Never seen such an immature crowd !

                            Ashutoshji!AK became quite popular by "exposing the frailties of politicians in power"!Today he is "in power"in NCT-Delhi only but under illusion of ruling over India from Delhi!For a "city-state"  he wants to spend Crores of rupees to"let people know what his Govt.has achieved"!"Achievements speak for themselves"!Where is the need for publicity!The one currently on the TV screen, "His name and NOT AAP Govt." appears ten times in 2 minutes insipid publicity film!"Daamkska? Naam kiska"??Pray do not try "to defend,the indefensible"!

                            Looks like Bhakts are done with abusing Shruti Seth and defending Vyapam killings. Now they are opposing 500 Cr ad budget for 5 years, since BJP doesn't disclose this, but eventually it comes out like electricity bill of Modiji and Jetliji. Be preparared for another shock brothers ;)
