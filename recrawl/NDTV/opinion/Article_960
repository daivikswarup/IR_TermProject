Headline::::What Modi Got Grossly Wrong in Paris



DateTime::::2015-12-21T19:48:00+05:30




                                As the old saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. That is what has happened with the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that Modi announced on behalf of India at the very start of the Paris Conference on Climate Change. By the end of the conference, the INDCs had been converted into NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) written into the "pledges" made by each participating party. India has now to convert Modi's INDCs into Indian NDCs backed by a road map showing how exactly we propose to meet the goals - a roadway to results. That is where the problem arises of the "pledged" NDCs having now to be realized as international commitments freely entered into.
Till Modi decided to steal the show at Paris, our INDCs were relatively modest. We showed our commitment to fighting climate change but based these commitments on the principles evolved at the first global environment meet held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. Of these Rio principles, the basic one was that the war on climate change would be based on "common but differentiated responsibilities" (CBDR) as between developed and developing countries. This meant that while both developing and developed countries accepted "common" responsibilities for mitigating climate change, the responsibilities would have to be "differentiated" as between the developed and the developing countries. Clearly the more the developed countries do to discharge their "historic responsibility" for polluting the atmosphere that causes climate change, the more would the burden on developing countries be diminished. This is known as "climate justice".
By upping the ante on INDCs, Modi undermined developing country solidarity but succeeded in earning plaudits from the developed countries - unsurprisingly because the higher the level of INDCs committed to by a major developing country, the lower need be their own commitments. Thus, one more consequence of rushing in where angels fear to tread was that the way was opened for the whole concept of "historic responsibility" to be ejected through the window. The basic rationale for differentiation thus became understated.
But the real problem for us lies not in the international arena of verbose and obscure diplomatic jargon but in the very real steps that will have to be taken on the ground in India to give credence to Modi's INDCs as we convert them into pledged NDCs requiring Plans of Action.
Modi proclaimed that within the next 15 years - that is, by 2030 - we would cut carbon emissions by 33% to 35% by ensuring that 40% of our installed capacity would be from non-fossil fuels, principally solar and wind energy. Our earlier stand had been that by 2022, we would install 20,000GW of non-fossil power. In one uninhibited leap, Modi increased that figure five-fold to be attained within eight years of the earlier target date, viz, 2030. To this end, he pledged the nation to adding 175,000 Gigawatts of non-fossil power by 2022, of which 100,000 would be contributed by solar energy and 75,000 GW by wind power.
Desirable as these end-results might be in themselves, neither solar nor wind power comes without costs. As far as solar power is concerned, the current cost of generating solar power is some three times the cost of generating power from coal or gas. The India consumer is, therefore, going to end up finding a huge hole in his pocket. Or, alternatively, Government would end up with a huge hole in its pocket subsidizing solar-generated energy. Moreover, technical problems relating to storage and transport remain unsolved as of now. Equally, solar power is not suitable for vehicular transportation. There is also the need to supplement solar power with traditional sources of energy when the sun does not shine.
But the most serious problem of all is that vast stretches of land are required for the installation of solar panels. Rajasthan is ahead of the rest of the country on solar energy principally because vast acreage of uninhabited land is available in the Thar desert. But wherever there is habitation, displacement on a humungous scale will be required to meet the Modi pledge. Modi is, of course, indifferent to peoples' displacement as he so dramatically established in Gujarat. Indeed, the essence of the "Gujarat model" was the forcible acquisition of land at a pittance, throwing the people off it, and then handing over the vacated land to fat cats at a derisory price or even for free.This column has earlier drawn attention to the Twelfth Plan finding that while Gujarat's tribal population is only 8 percent, 76% of those displaced by Modi were tribals. It is only if human suffering on such a scale is marked up as the inevitable cost of development that the Modi model works. That is why he was so anxious to amend the Land Acquisition law. While the law did not get amended despite the Modi government promulgating and re-promulgating the amendments three times over, it is impossible to see how so much solar power as pledged in Paris can be installed without displacing lakhs, perhaps crores, of poor, voiceless people. These issues of displacement and rehabilitation have to be thought through before thoughtlessly undertaking international pledges. It would not be in keeping with Modi's authoritarian style to do so, but these niggling doubts are bound to surface as Modi's government turns easily given international pledges into a credible Plan of Action to show how 100,000GW of solar power is to be added to our grid within the next six to seven years.
A further 75,000GW of Modi's pledge is to be redeemed through wind power. Clean though wind power is, it suffers from the same technological gaps that trip up solar power. But while wind power does not have as serious consequences for the displacement of people as solar power does, its basic paradox is that it saves the environment by damaging the environment. Madhav Godbole's report on the Western ghats has convincingly demonstrated that generating wind power in the ghat areas requires situating the wind-mills on the top of hills. Roads have to be built to each of these hill-tops. The environmental consequences of extensive road works in the ecologically sensitive ghat areas would lead to environmental disaster. Has Modi taken this paradox into account while unthinkingly pledging his country to wind-power generation targets that can be met only by causing environmental damage to contain environmental damage?
Modi rounded off his pledges by also pledging to "enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide". Had his audience been Indian, he might have been laughed out of court. For, far from adding to our forest cover, we have been seriously depleting it. The depletion of forest cover, and the consequent displacement of tribal populations, has been the root cause of the Naxal movement in central India. Every Act designed to protect and promote tribal interests, from the Rights of Forest Dwellers Act to the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act has been undermined and subverted. In India as a whole, 55% of the burden of displacement has fallen on the tribals who constitute less than ten percent of our population.  Moreover, forest lands are not always lands with forest cover; they include lands which were once forest covered but are now barren wasteland with little or no forest cover, yet continue be designated as forests because the century-old Indian Forests Act, 1927 say so. Neither knowing what our real forest cover is, nor the pace at which it is being eaten up, nor putting in place general measures of relief, rehabilitation, alternative employment and self-governance for the displaced millions, Modi has blindly pledged a staggering increase in our forest cover without answering the problems that are bound to arise as the Paris pledges are converted into specific Plans of Action.
Of course, there is one way out. That is to go back on what Modi promised to the world. Does the man have the integrity of character to admit that he was wrong, that he got carried away playing to the gallery, that he cannot redeem the solemnly pledged Indian word?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            OMG, Mr. Mani, i for a change decided to read through this article (not sure if it qualifies to be called so), but found the same pessimistic mindset that he has for decades.<br/><br/>
After rejecting all non-renewable resource options with his limited knowledge on the subject, what is he trying to suggest? Shall we continue to burn fossil fuels at the same rate as before? At least Mr.Modi has set an ambitious goal for the country, and we can try to reduce our emissions.. No one is going to kill us if we fall short of our promises, at least we will learn how to be more responsible in our attempts to reach our promises.<br/><br/>
Mr. Mani, your thoughts on non-renewable resources are stale, you seriously need to read up hell lot of literature on the subject. Do you have any idea how far solar energy technology advanced today? Please do yourself a favor reading about Elon Musk and others.... please stop spreading incorrect info and stop blaming Mr.Modi for everything.

You are the biggest sycophant of Gandhi family and you have lived all your life licking Gandhis. Get a life and then criticize. Please read readers comments and stop writing nonsensical articles.

                            Mr. Mani show some decency in addressing Prime Minister of India..as PM Modi!Though we all know it cannot be expected from you and nobody takes you seriously.Actually you have deleted the word "decency" from your Dictionary, when you were asking Pakistanis to remove PM Modi Government in order to have good relation! We also fail to understand why you did not express your opinions when UPA was in Power and Corruption was at its peak with 2G, Coal Gate,Common-Wealth Games etc and wrote articles like " What Congress Got Horribly Wrong..." or more recently " What Sonia and Rahul Gandhi Got Horribly Wrong.." in case of National Herald Case or "What Robert Vadra Got Horribly Wrong..." in case of various Land Deals.Had you raised all these issues at right time,then guess Congress would have Not reduced to 44 Seats in last General Elections!Rise above Sycophancy of Gandhis and advice your Leadership &amp; Prince Charming to let this Government run the Country, behave like a Constructive Opposition,don't disrupt the Parliament,debate and Legislate, for the sake of the Nation OR Perish in the next General Election...

It is absolutely fine to be a critic but you should also have a positive engagement with readers on the national subject if you choose to write. Be reasonable or just get lost from this developing nation rather than being a blocker. You may not want to, but the nation wants to move with development agenda.<br/><br/>

                            Bottomline is that 2 deg C temperature rise (from pre-industrial temps) is the limit the UN panel has set before irreversible climate change sets in. We may then be in a situation where one step of progress is negated by two retrograde steps due to extreme climate events. Today we have already seen a temperature rise of 1 deg C. That means we are already halfway there.<br/>
68 years of blindly following a developmental model propagated by the west means we have no backup plan to reverse our contribution to this disaster. So we can either accept there is a problem and do something about it or haggle for a better deal. But the pressure is such today that no-one is going to offer you a deal on a platter particularly when others like China who were giving the same arguments of historic responsibility have backed out. Chief among these is China. <br/>
Question isnt whether we have done the right thing or not by making these commitments. Question is does this govt have the skill and leadership to along with it even the dissenting voices within the country to fulfill these tall commitments.

                            Dear Mr Iyer, pardon me for using unparliamentary language. You should be a real idiot. People have been talking of intolerance and giving examples. Here is a good example of intolerance. There are two things I would like to point out (amongst the many foolish arguments). 1) You have mentioned that the cost of solar power is three times the cost of conventional sources - patently wrong. Today the cost of solar power (bid offered by Sun Edison for Telangana) is Rs 4.19. and this is the equal to what most coal based plants are offering to  SEBs. After all we have no 'Jayanti tax' and that is the reason for lower costs. 2) You have blabbered about something on rehabilitation etc on the context of forest cover. When the PM goes and talks in a climate summit, he speaks about the goals. You dont talk about rehabilitation in Paris. that is for us to do. Anyway what is wrong is having an ambitious target. As they say, aim for the moon and you will hit the roof. Did you guys not have ambitious targets in the UPS when each one said, I will swindle Rs. 176,000 crore in telecom and the other one saying I will do Rs. 2,00,000 crore in coal!!!

                            It is true that the developed countries have contributed more to global pollution than the developing countries and equitably should take more of the cost of repairing the damage. The problem is that the world woke up to global warming only 200 years after pollution started. CBDR is a great idea, but there is no legal framework to enforce it. Hence it is better for all to cooperate to ensure that something gets done. Being obstinate serves no purpose. As Gandhiji said, an eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind. The rest of the article is the usual Modi bashing which serves no purpose. Modi is the elected PM of India, which Aiyer is unable to digest. His views and actions are what he feels best for India and they seem good. Solar power and wind power are two excellent renewable sources of energy and have to be encouraged and obstacles to implementation need to be studied and removed. Increasing forest cover is a very good idea from all angles. Instead of going to Pakistan and making foolish statements Aiyer would be better off participating in schemes for the national good. Alternatively he could help his bosses stay out of jail by using his historical knowledge of the Congress party to explain how a Congress founded newspaper became the personal property of the Gandhis. With assets of Rs. 5000 crores to boot. If that is not theft, what is?

1. Leadership is to make things happen rather than wringing hands &amp; insisting how it can't be done.  But leadership has not been Congress' forte in the last 20 years or so.  Hence, you may not be able to comprehend such a thought.<br/>
2. While talking on land acquisition for Solar Power, you insidiously slipped in the old accusation of land being withdrawn and handed over to 'fat cats'.  Come off it, will you !  Industrialisation is also required and some displacement of people is not unexpected. <br/>
3. In line with your comments to a surprised Hamid Mir of Geo TV you have summed up by saying the only way is to go back on what Modi has promised the world.  But then he isn't your PM; that bl**dy chaiwala, is he ?  But he remains the PM for the rest of the country. And he will remain so unless the BJP overplays the Hindutva card.  So far it appears to be under control.

                            While the Modi government gained very little in the Paris round, previous Congress governments also failed the nation.  The biggest failure has been the inability to get the developed nations to bear the cost - however, it has been no different from the past. However, the failure bu successive Congress governments to develop the power sector has meant that our emissions remained abysmally low &amp; we started the discussions on the wrong foot. Mr Aiyer, the facts show the Congress has prevented the nation from progressing &amp; it is high time that you stop commenting on attempts to economically develop the nation.

                            I am amazed at the lies contained on here. Seriously Mr. Iyer, is truth so 'subjective'?<br/><br/>
First of all, the way we had been painted in to a corner before the summit, we didn't have much of a chance to change course drastically without being seen as a climate pariah. Would you care to share that we along with the entire developing world were sold out by your esteemed colleague Mr. Jairam Ramesh who didn't even care to consult his own Prime Minister before standing our traditional position on its head? It was he who declared that our position of insisting historical polluters should pay was 'wrong' and equity demanded that developing countries should also cut emissions. He got standing ovations and claps, while the whole of the developing world was utterly dismayed. Some developing countries went to the extent of saying India had stabbed them in the back, while the PM could only look red in the face. The question is, where were you?<br/><br/>
Here are some additional facts. Solar doesn't cost three times as much as coal any more, it is CHEAPER than coal. The last two PPAs signed by AP with Sun Edison and Softbank were at ₹4.63/kWH, we'll below grid parity. Coal PPAs with domestic coal are coming at ₹4.80-5.20 while imported coal is well above ₹6 and gas is, guess what, ₹12-14. Exactly how big a 'hole' are we talking about?<br/><br/>
You said 'vast tract of land'. Really? And coal plants don't need land? Kindly look at a place called Sompetta in AP where prime wetland of 1600 acres had to be acquired for a coal fired 1300MW plant. Why? Because you need to be close to the coast for an imported coal based plant. Farmers protested, police fired and people died. Contrast that with solar. Yes you will need some more land, but it doesn't have to be close to the coal mine or the coast, it doesn't have to be contiguous, and you don't have to abandon a site if one farmer refuses to part with his land. In fact, most of the solar capacity is built on land sold voluntarily. <br/><br/>
Solar and renewables have their problems. They don't give reliable power. But we Indians should thank our luck that they have become so cheap and we can make a virtue out of the necessity. Otherwise, what Mr. Ramesh had started would have ended with us getting stuck in the stone age.

Keeping this issue aside, why does it seems that all our politicians are soo worried about "India" (Big ideas only) but not their own constituencies. Do work in your own constituency and India will shine too. The people who elected you are not living in some foreign country.

                            Your comments always are negative. During UPA reign I am surprised why Congress President did not take your expert advice to make India self sufficient. Writing articles does not help always. Criticizing an opponent is easy. Have courage to criticize your own party whose actions caused the juvenile rapist to be freed. After that Congress gave their approval to pass the bill.Where were you for the last three years. Try to free yourself from negative thinking and help my country to progress. Do write positive articles so that it helps the country to progress. Now a days young mind is very smart and we all understand actions and slogans. Coming years positive approach by every party will ensure their standing in front of the voters. So criticizing Modi on every issue does not help anyone. It is simple waste of an intelligent mind. If u are so worried meet him with all publicity and create a logical point which will be  acceptable instead of stalling parliament and causing loss to taxpayers money.<br/>

Don't use this space and time if you just want to argue for the sake of it, even though its evident. Shame.

Mani, if you had think for future and planned, Delhi today would not have require to go for 'odd - even'. It was development without thinking for future and today every Delhiet suffering due to this un-planned development by Congress - Neither Metro connectivity increased with pace of City nor Road or Flyover developed to handle city's vehicle with average speed of 40kmph to 60 kmph nor BRTS success (just go to Ahmedabad and see how good BRTS is working).<br/><br/>

As for land acquisition gujarat govt has been applauded for managing acquisition by many even by Supreme Court. <br/>
For the acquisition law it was necessary to enact be it now or later it would have to be amended and i don't say it even the RBI governor and many top economist like jagdish bhagwati has asked for it.<br/>
even upa minister anand sharma wasn't in favor of land acquisition bill 2013.<br/><br/>
As for the targets we'll have to wait and see.<br/>
but i don't think electricity from solar is as expensive as mentioned and it has been coming down as the production of solar energy increases.<br/>
It is aroung 5-7 rupees now and will further go down as more R&amp;D is done on it.<br/><br/>
The govt may not have done many good things but it has still acted as a strong govt specially on problems related to popular perception where the previous govt was always seen playing politics.<br/>
This govt could have played popular politics in patidar protest and could have held on to its rural seats but it didn't did that.

                            First thing Mr Aiyar should know is to separate out politics from serious issues like climate change and development. As a member of a political party sitting in the opposition, he may question the government's actions. As a citizen of India, he has every right to question anything that affects the average citizen's quality of life. Coming to the points he raised about viability etc on non conventional and renewable energy sources and generation in India, he is wrong. India is considered to one of the most techno-economically viable nations in the world as far as solar power generation is considered. Connected grid generation and household solar cells with subsidies are a model that many nations are following based on India's experience. Coming to wind energy, we have one of the longest coast lines and have one of the largest continental shelves in the world. The government is planning offshore, onshore and near shore wind farms, which I am sure Mr. Aiyar would know. The environmental clearances as far as offshore and near shore wind farms are concerned have been optimized to encourage more players. We have some of the lowest per unit costs for solar and wind energy generation in the world. It is a collective effort and initiative and we all have to work. If we keep playing politics where politics is not warranted, we only a mockery of ourselves. When on one side, the entire world has acknowledged the stand that India took during the COP21 at Paris, and supported the motions mooted by India, Mr. Aiyar chose to play politics. It is time we start thinking as matured individuals and not with myopic visions of petty politics.

                            I regard him one the most intolerant person... He can't tolerate BJP being in power.. I think his sole objective now is to dethrone them... You can see intolerance all over his blogs, debates and writ on even his facial expressions during the debate... He has intolerance for ideology which doesn't matches his ideology .. When his ideology could be beared by majority for decades why is he showing so much intolerance and let others function....

                            Mani, have you ever asked this question to you self ' why do we have chores of voiceless people' even after 6 decades of independence ? Why are we still talking about basic amenities like water, road, electricity to common man even after 6 decades. Don't you think you guys have faltered badly somewhere ??grow up.

                            Sri MSA does't miss an opportunity to criticise Sri Modi/ NDa policies irrespective of the fact whether policies are good or bad for India.But he conveniently ignores issues of corruption during UPA / Congress rule.During the normal course of events,as a pubic figure and political analyst he should have written a blog on National Herald case. But he doe't, revealing the prejudices, biases, hatred MSA as analyst harbours. Therefore, the opinions and "truth" revealed by MSA and his ilk should be taken with a pinch of salt.

                            As usual, Mani Shankar Aiyar is lying. Anyone who is even remotely familiar with development in the field of solar energy would know that the difference in cost between solar energy and energy from traditional sources is negligible. He's also conveniently forgotten the fact that the energy efficiency of solar panels has increased by nearly 50% over the last five years (and constantly improving), which means a lot less area will be required for setting up solar panels. <br/><br/>
Lastly,I see nothing wrong in a prime minister committing to an afforestation programme.If India's forest reserves are seriously depleted, the credit goes to Mr. Aiyar's party, which has ruled India for 55 out of the 68 years since independence. It says something about Congress efficiency, that a colonial era piece of law, passed nearly 90 years ago, is still in force!

                            Well written......the problem is lack of proper study, consultation with scientific members and financial aspect. Politician just say without proper planning and discussion.<br/>
Commitments were made at the cost of poor people of India. They are victims always who ever in power.<br/><br/>
Looking the  scam amount (5,000Cr, 155Cr, 2000cr), I wish if these money would have been utilized for development of poors, farmers, education, then we all would have be the citizen of a developed nation.

                            what real fascinates me does Mani Shanker Aiyar read what the public are say about his comments...on the NDTV website.<br/><br/>
I read the above article and half the article has no value as his has created false non-facts about solar energy.<br/>
but to criticise the present govt....over and over again about every issue and especially Narendra Modi is unbelievable.

                            MS AIYYAR. Do us a favor - Give more derogatory remarks in Pak so that the party expels Traitor like you   ! Don't you have any other topic to talk about ? Why the hell do you keep cribbing about Modi on and on? Clearly suggests you're filled with guilt that you had called Modi a chaiwaala, who can never become a PM. We still see that video and laugh at you.

                            First time ever in this Gem of a man's life got some thing wrong slightly, let me try to correct with my peanut brains (relatively). The world has an installed electrical capacity of little less than 6k GW and Mr. Gem of a Man Mani sir says few zeros extra. Anyways these few zero's does not matter as the sole purpose of the article was not about it anyways. <br/><br/>
Mr. Gem of a Man Mani Sir, hope you lick well and get the zero's added in the pay cheque for the article. Hopefully you know on which side of the number to add the zero's i guess.

                            All the time Aiyar's columns are anti modi which may result in not too many taking him seriously. He should take leaf out of his fellow parliamentarian Jay Panda's book to be taken seriously.
