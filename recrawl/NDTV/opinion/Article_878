Headline::::Why Mr Jaitley is Wrong About Writers



DateTime::::2015-10-17T14:17:00+05:30




                                The "manufactured controversy" (to quote our honourable Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley) over the return by over 40 writers of their Sahitya Akademi Awards in protest against the Dadri butchery of Mohammed Akhlaq and related killings refuses to die down. Each day more writers join what is already being dubbed by some (in an allusion to one of the Sangh Parivar's more egregious schemes) as "#AwardWapasi". The latest was a 17-year-old who returned her Bala Sahitya Akademi award. There are some 1,300 award recipients, and there is no sign that the steady hemorrhage from their ranks is about to stop.
When questioned by a young PTI reporter about this on the sidelines of an academic event in Thiruvananthapuram, I said three things. First, with all due modesty, I pointed out that I have never been given a Sahitya Akademi Award, so I don't really have a locus standi to comment. Nonetheless, in response to her insistence that I speak as a writer, I stated that I strongly support and admire the values, convictions and courage of the writers who have stood for freedom of expression by returning their awards. Still, I added, I regret this method of protest, since the award is recognition by an independent body of intellectual, literary, creative or academic merit, and should not be confused with the political issues of the day. The Sahitya Akademi, though set up and maintained by the Government of India, is not a political body. The political fight must be fought - but why dishonour this recognition, which the writers have received from juries of eminent writers, not from government bureaucrats?
In the firestorm of debate and commentary that followed, several reminded me (not that I needed reminding) of Rabindranath Tagore's reaction to the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre. Gurudev had returned his knighthood in protest, writing to the Viceroy that he did not wish to sport such an honour "in the incongruous context of humiliation". But there is a huge difference my critics failed to notice. Tagore returned a knighthood, not his Nobel Prize for Literature. The equivalent today would be a writer returning a Padma Shri given by the Modi Government - not a Sahitya Akademi Award.
As I also pointed out (and the reporter quoted, in the fuller version of my remarks that few bothered to read), awards are our society's tributes to the achievements of writers, and neither the achievements nor the tributes can be rolled back. What is more, the Modi Government is a temporary phenomenon, which my fellow Congressmen hope to bring to an end in another four years - literature is, and should be, far more enduring. What happens if a more acceptably liberal government comes to power - will those who have today returned their awards then petition to get them back again?
Of course, I admire these writers for the strength of their convictions and their rejection of the climate of intolerance that has been fuelled by the Modi Government. It took courage to stand up for their cause at a time when so many others have preferred silence. The protesting writers are justified in their concern, because an atmosphere of intellectual freedom is essential to promote and permit creativity in writing.
Freedom of expression is something which any writer has a moral obligation to speak up for. It is not just an abstract right in the Constitution; it is as important as the blood that flows in our veins or the ink that flows in our pens.
If the Sahitya Akademi's limp response to recent developments is a disappointment to these writers, the Akademi itself must be pressured to review its stand on these issues. But the way to do it, for a writer, is to write - to find creative expressions for her legitimate disquiet - not to return an award which the Modi Government had no part in giving them. Indeed, since I was speaking in Kerala, I pointed out that many prominent Malayalam writers including M T Vasudevan Nair, Paul Zacharia and Sugathakumari have not returned their Akademi honours.I do not think that they are any less committed to freedom.
This does not mean, however, that I share Mr Jaitley's rejection of their conduct as an "alternative strategy" of "politics by other means". Mr Jaitley argues in his blog that the writers are "camouflag[ing] the truth"and blaming the Central Government for crimes for which "nobody has alleged any governmental complacency" (I assume he meant "complicity", but let's let that pass). The crimes alluded to are, of course, the Dadri lynching and the murders of three rationalists, most recently the Sahitya award-winning Mr Kalburgi. Mr Jaitley tries to turn the political tables by adding: "to manufacture a revolt, it is necessary to obfuscate the truth and create the impression that the Modi Government is responsible for these crimes, even if they took place in the Congress and Samajwadi Party ruled States."
Now that is political sophistry of the most cynical order. It is absurd to take refuge behind state governments' constitutional responsibility for law and order when no one in their wildest imaginations ascribes any of the crimes Mr Jaitley is referring to, to supporters of either the Congress or the Samajwadi party. The blame rests clearly on the climate created by the BJP government during its 17 months in power, when intolerance of the worst kind has been allowed to rage rampant across the land - fuelled by the most irresponsible statements by BJP ministers like Giriraj Singh, Mahesh Sharma and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and prominent BJP MPs like Yogi Adityanath and Sakshi Maharaj.Â  As even a vocal sympathizer of Mr Modi like the editor R. Jagannathan admits, "Public perceptions are not formed in a vacuum - they have some basis in reality."
None of these statements by senior figures in the ruling dispensation has ever been repudiated by the Prime Minister. Mr Modi's feeble denial - after a prolonged silence that even his admirers found difficult to defend - was universally derided as falling well short of the mark.
If Mr Modi sincerely wished to say the right thing to the nation, this is what he should have said:
"As Prime Minister, I condemn such acts as unworthy of the civilization we are proud to claim as our own. As leader of the BJP, I call upon my supporters to desist in word and deed from statements and actions that can fuel or legitimize intolerance and violence against people of different views in our diverse society. Anyone who supports, incites or condones such behaviour will have no place in my government or on the Treasury benches. I will demand their resignations immediately and I will prosecute the wrongdoers to the fullest extent of the law,,even if they belong to my party."
Now that would be statesmanship worthy of a man who seeks to lead the whole of India. What a pity we cannot expect such words from our Prime Minister.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

bjp its ministers, cms, rss people are creating controversies on each day...mr jaitely does not notice them..when others are reacting to such controversies, theirs are termed as manufactured controversies...first create controversies by actions and statements and opinions and then blame others...citizens are watching this..and it should get reflected in ongoing elections...

                            Why are these writers not writing about the injustices and the polarized atmosphere prevailing in our country today? That would make more of an impact than the empty, merely symbolic gesture of returning awards. The writers who have returned their awards have access to the different linguistic audiences across this nation. Why not make use of that pen to expose/ridicule/shame the parochial and bigoted mindset that has brought about these days upon us?

                            Writers enjoyed the awards &amp; publicity for years and comfortably returning the awards to get some more publicity. All these years they saw nothing wrong and suddently realized they need to protest.

                            The Sahitya Akademy is a body comprised mainly by writers, who choose which writers should receive awards for the literary work. As such, when and if it speaks, it does so on behalf of the literary community. The various writers' grouse is just that... it chooses to say nothing at the gradual erosion of our freedom. It is the literary community that we common folk depend upon to speak out and guard our freedoms. That is why, when fascism takes over, they first target the literary community, knowing fully well that they should be the first to be silenced. So, in our context, if the literary community do not speak out, if the Sahitya Akadamy does not take an unambiguous stand, all is lost. The various writers who are returning their awards is in protest of this lack of action, and I for one applaud them for the stand they are taking in protecting our rights and freedoms.

                            Great Blog, we all know that we can not expect kind words or a heavy hand on communal BJP leaders from Modi. Who they are giving hateful speaches to increase tension and communal disharmony in our country. Modi will never strongly condemn them as he believes in so called hindu extremists Vote bank which has grown modi support right after gujrat riots and made him a PM from a CM. He continous to keep silence on such issues as he expects that his support by hindu extremists will grow. Mr Modi,  I voted for You, on development promises, Next time you will be thrown into the trash for making my country another Afghanistan,  Thumbs down to you for being a fascist.

                            It is very sad to see the comments here against Shashi Tharoor. it is unbelievable how Modi has turned this nation into a Hindu fascist state,  who doesn't believe that a supreme leader of india should be held responsible for a failure of his own party members to keep the communal harmony and a peaceful coexistence of different religions and communities.  These are the same Hindu Folks that ask for a temple to be build in UAE, America and Europe,  but refuse religious rights of their own fellow indian citizens for several reasons. This is the darkest face of Hypocrisy that india has ever faced.  People are not standing up for equal rights for all. Modi will pay the price in next election as hindu liberals like me will outnumber the uneducated extremists in next election and modi will be thrown into a trash barrel.

                            Mr Tharoor, did not take pains to read such a long blog as sensed it could be on expected lines. Congressmen like you and Mani write as if you possess entire wisdom of universe which was conspicuously absent when Congress was ruling for 10 years. Here it is a simple question why selective outburst and cry by writers, When Taslima Nasreen ( writer) was attacked  these writers did not find cause to worry about free speech. So its all hypocrisy to pay debt to Past Masters ( read Congress)

                            There was no intolerance when Sanjay Gandhi forcibly sterilized 6.2 million men which was more than even Hitler? When Salman Rushdie's book was banned and when he was denied entry to Jaipur lit fest? When Taslima Nasreen was attacked with flower pots in Kolkata? When Kashmiri Pandits were butchered? When lakhs of crores of taxpayers money was looted by congi govt? When online articles criticizing the congi govt were pulled down citing section 66(A)? You have absolutely basis to take a moral high ground. Remember M.F. Hussein who had to flee India during congi govt? Remember the riots of Bhagalpur and Muzaffarnagar? What did Manmohan Singh say about the Assam riots? Just because you have a way with words does not mean you can also twist the truth!

                            Sashi Ji, this not not first time in freedom of India a writer got killed, these are unfortunate incidents, these same set of intellectuals vehemently asking the voters not to vote Modi, it is very clear these people have a ideological position and they do not like Modi simple. These so called rational writers why they write against Hindu practice only, some even mentioning to urinate on idols (is this freedom of expression ), let these people write against other religion. It is hypocrisy. These people should have returned the awards when Kashmiris are driven out of Kasimir. To an extent I know NDTV will not publish these comments, even though they think they support freedom of speech.

                            Mr Modi did not get elected to be PM of India so that he would take Tharoor's advice on what to say and when.  Mr Modi does have access to information which any common man would have access to,  namely that the Congress Dirty Tricks department is at play.  How else can one explain the action of Nayantara Sahgal?  This character, totally irrelevant to the life of an average Indian is revived from the dead to lead a campaign of  misinformation.  And what was Sahgal's qualification?  Her writing?  Rubbish!  Her contribution to society?  Rubbish!  Her only relevance is that she is the niece of Nehru!  Congress has scored an own goal here!  Nehru is gradually being exposed as the back-stabbing slimy and shady character he was.  It is not a status symbol to be associated with that fraud any more!  Tharoor himself is not exactly the bastion of probity.  We all know the part he played in the cover-up that followed the exposure of Kojo Anan, son of Tharoor's boss Kofi in the 'oil for food' scandal, we all know the part Tharoor played in the IPL scandal involving the non-existent 'sweat-equity' of his then girl-friend Sunanda and of course his part in the mysterious death of the latter.  Should Modi take lessons on what to say from such a character?

                            Mr Sashi Tharoor has been very explicit in what he expects from the PM. Great.  But the core issue is - is intolerance the only chronic ill in our society.  The first and foremost thing I would object to is the use of word rationalist to describe people who oppose Hinduism or its caste systems but who are silent with other religions and practices.  While I would not condone in anyway the heinous acts of cowards I would equally accuse the so called writers whose conscience has suddenly been awakened.  It appears to me low morals and corruption in all walks of life is acceptable than some stray elements expressing ridiculous views.  These authors if they really want a better India should be writing their views to reign in these misguided elements or make others ignore such elements rather than react in the way they have done now.

The seeds of intolerance were actually planted by Congress by its appeasement politics, BJP is just a new kid on the block. Don't blame the country's current atmosphere on the 18-months rule by BJP. Actually, I would argue that the rise of BJP itself is the result of Congress' severe misrule. All things are connected. Until you open your eyes and stop misinforming the public to score political points, Congress will never rule this country again. May be it was Congress that was a temporary phenomenon!

                            Mr Shashi Tharoor is the right man in the wrong party.<br/>
Has he considered that by associating with the party that acted criminally, hypocritically and communally in tutoring and guiding Sanjiv Bhatt to level false charges against Mr. Modi he is supporting political chicanery of the worst kind. The entire conspiracy against Mr Modi by congress, media house and NGO's along with Sanjiv Bhatt has now been exposed by the SC. Does Mr Tharoor not feel that as a Indian, writer and a parliamentarian he should condemn this? In the past, often Mr Tharoor has given voice to his conscience and faced the ire of Sonia G. May be, it is time now, to do it once and for all and sever ties with congress; that is criminal, corrupt and communal. Mr Tharoor's reason for staying with congress is "secularism". But is it sufficient reason and is congress really practising secularism? Congress secularism is very opportunistic and involves minority appeasement.<br/>
None of  the so called writers were able to answer the selectiveness of their outrage; why no outrage when Sikhs or hindus were killed? No outrage on emergency or Bhagalpur or Assam. No outrage when Taslima Nasreen was hounded and attacked. No outrage when Salman Rushdie's Satanic verses is banned or when he is not allowed to speak at Jaipur literary festival. This list is very large indeed.<br/>
Of-course, in all of this I am not thinking cynically and if there is a selfish reason for Mr Tharoor to stick with congress then all of the above arguments do not matter.

                            What have most of these so-called writers  done for the society they live in and for the nation they represent?Since large number of 'awards 'are necessarily to be distributed each year by these 'academies'to justify their existence, most of these writers have lop-sided personality, which is now abundantly reflected in their action of returning the awards!  In future will no writer accept these awards! It is easy to blame others, but how much constructive one has been to the society is of significance. Let these writers have introspection and see what they have done for knitting the fibre of harmony ,not only amongst people of various religions but also amongst categories of people from various castes, creed and sex!

                            Very good article. BJP is becoming arrogant and blind with power of majority in parliament and trying to fulfil wishes of its backers RSS and its allied VHP, BD, Hindu Vahini, Ram Sene etc. who supported BJP in election in 2014 to bring Modi ji as PM. How PM can go against its mentor and backer who not only remotely control him from Nagpur but also review ministerial performance being external to government. Shashi Tharoor has given very timely and sane advice to Modi as what he should have said timely, un-equivocally and strongly. Modi ji poor statement that too very weak and after a fortnight after ghastly murder of a muslim based on rumour (no fact) by BJP and Hindutva cadres. It seems he is PM of only Hindus and not PM of pluralistic, secular and democratic India. This is very reason well concerned, peace and India loving people like Sahitya Academy award winners and others are expressing their angust and condemnation of Modi's silence and indirect support to Hindutva forces who are bent are igniting hatred and violence and fear among Muslim community and divide country on communal lines.

                            Mr. Tharoor, at the outset let me admit that I admire most of your comments. But this time I feel it is more for the gallery who objected to your earlier comments. First of all, was the climate during Congress regime such that it prompted killers to to murder Mr. Narendra Dabholkar? Where were these same people who are returning their awards now? Dadri is indeed very sad and response from our PM is pathetic. If we did not like our ex PM remaining silent on the scams going on in the country, we cannot justify the current PM remaining silent now. But why did you not write such speech for our ex PM. It is clear that media is responsible for stoking the fire. Especially NDTV, with its left leanings is publishing only one sided views. Why not abide by real journalism and publish the other side also and let the readers take their own call? I have noticed that at times, any comment which is against such article is also not published. Then who is talking about freedom of expression?

                            At the outset, any act of violence deserves the highest condemnation and necessary punitive action by the law enforcing agencies.<br/><br/>
As usual, Dr. Shashi Tharoor's so called âTAKE' has ended up as a MIS-TAKE that lacked commonsense and depth in terms of research.  Here is Why Dr. Shashi Tharoor, is Wrong About Writers.<br/><br/>
1.	It has become âFASHIONABLE' and âELITIST' for the pseudo secular Dr. Shashi Tharoor and his clan to make anti INDIA and anti MODI/NDA statements in the media that comprises the print and electronic media as well. Maybe, considering the humungous patronage the media enjoyed since independence, they consider this as the right time to return some of the favours at least. <br/><br/>
2.	It is high time this clan come with other ways and means to oppose than the same, tried, tested and FAILED formula of drawing the people's attention on communal and caste topics only.  12 years since Gujarat riots is too long a time to test the viability of any idea to suppress NaMo. Focus on many of the burning issues, which is the creation of successive CON-gress/UPA governments since independence.<br/><br/>
3.	I am wondering what happened to the patriotism and freedom of speech of these so called "writers and self proclaimed intellectuals"(henceforth to be referred in this reply as BLOKES),  during the over 1000 communal riots since independence in the CON-gress ruled states, 1984 riots, 26/11, beheading of two Indian Jawans by Pakistan soldiers, COAL Scam, 2G-3G Scam etc.? Why didn't they return their awards then? Why only Post Kalburgi killing and Dadri?  Why not when Dabolkar was killed?  All these incidents have happened in the states ruled by the Congress party or its alliance partners.  Why these BLOKES are not questioning/criticizing the local CM's?  Isn't this political sophistry by Dr. Tharoor too to put all the blame on the centre?  Why this DOUBLE STANDARD?  <br/><br/>
4.	By the way, have these BLOKES  also returned the CASH with interest along with the award and certificate?  If yes, my humble bow to them.  <br/><br/>
5.	The selection of the committee members for the various Government/semi government awards has never, ever been above board since independence.  Hence, the silence by these BLOKES is understandable when incidents much more serious in nature happened post independence.  Here I applaud the Late Mr. Kushwant Singh for surrendering all his privileges post âOperation Bluestar'.<br/><br/>
6.	Dr. Tharoor's last sentence in the 3rd paragraph QUOTE: The equivalent today would be a writer returning a Padma Shri given by the Modi Government - not a Sahitya Akademi Award. UNQUOTE  This is a candid submission that all award winners and the committee members enjoy government patronage.  Because,  the present comes after the past.<br/><br/>
7.	How can the Sahitya Academi, website http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/, not be a government body?<br/><br/>
8.	The joke spreading in the social media about the difference between the Nobel Prize and Sahitya Academi Award is "The Nobel Prize makes you famous when you get it.   Sahitya Academi Award makes you famous only when you return it."  <br/><br/>
9.	Why should the Prime Minister use Dr. Tharoor's script for his statements and announcements?  He has his own mind, a great thinker and an orator par excellence. Why is it that that whatever that comes out of mouth(s) of pseudo seculars is 'SACROSANCT' and whatever that comes out of BJP leaders mouth is 'SACRILEGE"?  <br/><br/>
10.	The root cause analysis for all this angst is not PATRIOTISM.  It is the absence of the âperks of power' the pseudo seculars and BLOKES enjoyed which was deprived by the hardworking and tireless NaMo in 2014. I salute the people of INDIA for their faith in NaMo and I am sure that he will not let INDIA down.<br/><br/>
11.	It is high time old and failed ideologies of the pseudo seculars is BURIED thousands of feet deep and covered with concrete such that it never, ever resurrects for the remainder of mother earth. We want INDIA and INDIANS to think âDEVELOPMENT' and pursue it till it's logical conclusion.  Unfortunately, the pseudo seculars want INDIA to FAIL and that too very badly.  <br/><br/>
12.	Have you noticed that every time when NaMo travels abroad, Dr. Tharoor visits most of these countries and uses his UN clout giving interviews not very appreciative of INDIA?  This must definitely be having the blessings of the lady sitting at # 10, Janpath.<br/><br/>
God Save INDIA.  Jai Hind

                            If only Modi had said what Shashi Tharoor wrote in his last lines above - and followed through with actions - he would have instantly won the respect and support of a vast majority of the nation and would have shown himself to be a true leader. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately I dont expect Modi to do anything close to that.

                            India is a Free Democratic Nation. We have as much right to IGNORE the Award Returners, as much the "award returners" have right to return their awards. Till date even 1% population didn't know about 90% of these "award returners". Now at least 5 % know them. So returning the award gave them more fame, than accepting it. No wonder even a 17 year "Baal Sahityik" returned award as written in this blog. He or she is on Right Track. Keep it up. Way to go. In Sanskrit there is a saying "Yena Kena Prakarena Prasiddho Purusho Bhavet" meaning a man will try to be famous by any means.

                            Mr. Sashi, are you a politician or a writer? If you want award then either you have to be the former or the both together. In case you want to be a WRITER only, then you should not care about awards, you should have only pen to protest or to reflect the time in your own way. Rest is just politics. We (Indians) do not care about that.

                            I think the author's actions have nothing to do with freedom of writers. First of all freedom of expression is not under threat by any means. Nor the protest has anything to do with deaths of writers. Dabholar died in August 2013 under UPA. Even a few weeks have passed after Kalburgi's death. There is no clarity on who is responsible or if at all these 3 deaths are connected. Only issue looks like that these authors don't like the present Government and they have used Dadri incident as a ruse to protest. That is in fact their first clarion call, not the last straw. They said nothing about so many formal and informal bans and acts of ostracism. In Chinese there is a saying, if you keep repeating that something is bad , it will actually turn bad.

                            It is time that these elite writers stop picking holes they do not belong in politics or the running of the country they are thinkers not doers, we want them to educate and help educate, they must return their awards only because they have failed in their duty to educate (just look at the way the politicians of today behave). If they had so much of social engagement they will not have thrown up their arms in the air now. Kalam had rightly said that this country needs better teachers, thinkers and educators. Mr.Tharoor we know you are endowed with better control please do not fan the fire, try and douse it, at times you lean towards being another Mani.<br/>
All the best

                            Its much more balanced (article) than I presumed from subject. I wish you best luck to remove temporary phenomena of BJP government. But look at the others' point of view as well. And to be fair, you did partially looked at others' point of view. But there is equally strong opinion on social media, against such gimmick. One should take into account everything holistically. What main stream media publishing is one sided view, which they believe is (only) right way of looking at it. Main stream media is like literary bodies, which comprise only elite. And fortunately they are tiny part of population. Agreed, large number of people (Mango people, M talking about) have different political believes and reflects (to some extent) in comment section as well. But Main Stream Media is Tiny. Anyway, lets wait for Bihar Result.

                            I agree with Mr. Taroor, in all fairness the writers should return their prestigious Padma awards and also the monies that come with it. While the Dadri issue is deplorable, it is equally deceitful for political parties to politicize the issue. Instead they should focus to bring culprits to justice. Or, a cynical view: are the political parties in collusion to have "manufactured" this issue to deflect focus on real issues. In democracy, majority rules.

When these awardees got the awards they needed patronage to be published now there is no need. If these chaps lost touch and have been limited by their thought not able to connect with new generation problems is their to solve. They should use their intellect and available mediums to critique situations around rather than showing imbecility by returning awards which so called given by literature and not government. If they continue this demonstrates awards were govt patronage rather than literary excellence.

                            It is indeed matter of shame and regret, the social climate of intolerance, and to use religion as a political tool has its consequences Anybody can look in the Middle East and make up your mind. The social climate is  generating, and equality under the law for all, appears to be compromised. This is the biggest danger to the fabric of democracy in India. We stand on the shoulders of others who came before, they had cherished and brought democracy to India. It is the duty of all of us here and abroad to freedom and virtues of democracy must not be allowed to parish. There is a real danger all concerned must pay attention to it now before it's too late.

                            There are knowledgeable people like M/s Tharoor, Pilot and Deora in Congress. But, due to obvious compulsion, invariably they flout their conscience and as well willingly reduce their stature.

                            As I can understand the return of the awards by the writers is to protest the impotency/failure of the Academy to raise the voice against the Govt. promoting the divide in the country. And of course they are fulfilling their duty to the country by raising the issue and attracting the attention by the return of their awards to the Academy for not doing any thing to correct the wrongdoings of the Govt. because they are in power.

                            Many of the authors hide their wrong thoughts under eloquent language English including. Good language does not necessarily confirms good intentions or wrong perceptions. Actually writing itself is somewhat an art of shaping a perception. While no one can deny the right of writers to surrender their award, it is proven fact that human system behaves like a herd. The first sheep can turn the rest of the pack in the direction of its turn. <br/><br/>
Quite often regrettably, that first ends as a black sheep just as negatives have potential to spread faster. It is hard to tell that the first one belongs to that breed in this case in point, but, never the less everyone knows that a marker pen can mark any part of the passage of its choice. I hope, writers are not calling a bad name before hanging!

                            All Bhakts have same logic, same statements again and again. I am sick of explianing them. They keep on blaming media for targeting DAdri issue. The nature of media is such. Will u blame media if it targets AAP,Congress. U dont? Do u? Look how media raped UPA regime past 5 years. Modi benefitted by media. Shame u cant support media when it suits u and rreject when it doesnt.

                            Such a statement from modi is very high expectation. The modi i voted for is very different from the man I see today... I Regret voting for modi.. Am I the only one feeling this way?
