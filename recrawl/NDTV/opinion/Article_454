Headline::::It's a Crisis of Adolescence, Writes Ashutosh on AAP's Troubles



DateTime::::2015-03-13T17:28:00+05:30




                                
	(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	I see many smiling faces and also many unhappy faces. The smiles all say, "I told said so." The unhappy faces want to know why this is happening.
	Yes, I am talking about AAP, the Aam Aadmi Party. The smiling faces are of those who feel threatened by the very existence of AAP as it promises to overturn an establishment deeply entrenched in corruption. An edifice that has to be demolished if a clean, transparent and pro-citizen system has to be erected.
	The unhappy people are sympathizers of AAP. They love to see AAP as crusader against all that is corrupt and dysfunctional in the system.  
	AAP has been ridiculed from its inception by skeptics and critics. There has been an attempt to paint AAP black and tell the world that this party is no different. The BJP tried the trick during the Delhi elections. They lost badly, but unfortunately are unwilling to learn.
	Now, the same forces are active again. A conspiracy was hatched long back and those involved were the same people who did not want AAP to succeed. They tried their level best to see a BJP government installed in Delhi before the announcement of the dissolution of the Delhi Assembly. And once elections were announced, they tried to sabotage from within.  
	This process is still on and despite all their efforts and disruptive agenda, AAP will continue its march to cleanse the system and provide a model of alternate politics and governance.
	But today I want to dig deep and find out the real reason for the upheaval and crisis-like situation in AAP every now and then. Just when everyone in AAP and all its well-wishers thought that after its unprecedented success in Delhi it would have a smooth run, why is AAP in the news again?
	I see this as a "growing up problem". It is similar to a young kid transitioning from boyhood to adulthood. This is the most vulnerable age for a man or woman. He or she has to graduate to another level, has to leave behind childhood and the transition is still not complete - a kid and also an adult.
	The present crisis in AAP can be seen from this perspective. It's a crisis of adolescence.
	As we all know, AAP was born from a movement. India Against Corruption, led by Anna Hazare, gave birth to AAP. In 2011, a few individuals who were fed up with corruption decided to rebel against the system. They got massive support from the people.
	This movement changed the national discourse. Corruption became a national issue. People woke up and vowed to end to corruption. One of the offshoots of the movement led by Arvind Kejriwal decided to form a political party and contest elections as it seemed obvious that unless politics is cleaned from the inside, democracy will not be transparent and pro-citizen.
	These were people with dreams of a new world, a beautiful world, a world full of idealism. It was about moral values. But they forgot politics in the present context is not beautiful. It's not about idealism. It's not about morality. It's not a dream. It's the real world. It's reality. It is power. Raw power.
	AAP is a unique experiment to amalgamate power with morality, to mix idealism with realism; to bring back the pendulum of Indian politics to its equilibrium, to restore sanity in the system. But this will not happen overnight. It will take time. AAP is barely two years old. It's evolving. Its growth has been very fast, but its body will take time to adjust to that growth.  It is like a child suddenly thrown into the company of adults.
	AAP is being pulled in two opposite directions. One led by idealism and the other by realism. AAP decided to become a political party, but the transformation of a movement into a fully grown party has not yet happened. Till that process is not complete, there will be serious friction.
	A movement is temporary and is mostly about one issue. It's led by highly motivated individuals. A party is permanent; it's about every issue under the sun. It's led by seasoned individuals.
	A movement may survive a few days, or a few weeks or a few months or even a few years, but a party is 24x7, 365 days. People in politics give it an entire lifetime. It's a full-time profession.
	A movement is always in a hurry. It's impatient. It needs solution immediately. Politics is all about patience. It's the opposite of hurried. Politics is thick-skinned. A movement is very sensitive,  sometimes, oversensitive.
	AAP has to grapple with these two opposites. A minor adjustment in tactics suddenly becomes a big issue for some. They look at this as a major compromise in its core values. They don't realise that the world of outside politics is full of sharks and if AAP has to fulfill the ambitions of lakhs of idealists, then it has to learn to survive and for that some adjustment has to be made without making any compromises with its core ideology and its long-term strategy.
	This is not easy. Let the flower bloom. Let the boy grow. Let him attain adulthood, let the transformation from movement to party be complete. Let's not worry too much. It happens with every individual, it happens with every institution and it will happen with AAP too. Aag ka dariya hai, doobke jaanaa hai - literally, baptism by fire. There is no escape.

                            There is nothing illegal about this. However, these are all the ethical frauds commited by AAP. They have always tried to say that they are a different party with Inner Party Democracy, Swaraj, and Lokpal in the party. All these issues have been flung by Kejruddin onl. For Lokpal, he is holding two posts in the party and the bogus lokpal has not done anything about it.<br/>
WIth regards to democracy, they have publically humiliated PB and YY just because they spoke against the Farziwal.<br/>
Now I only understand one thing: DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING COMING OUT OF A REVOLUTION, SINCE MOST OF IT IS BIGGER FRAUD THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW.<br/>
And for Delhi people, known devel would have been better than an unknown angel!!!

                            You, Ashutosh, is one of the reason why AAP is in bad news. PB and YY may be idealists, but we need idealism in AAP as that is what makes it different. Ashutoshs are common and found in every party.

                            Dear Ashutosh, <br/>
I am neither sad nor happy as an observer of Indian Politics. I do see the role of a clean party very important in Indian politics. But if AAP does not stand for anything it said it stands for in the very words of the founding members and turns out to be an "Opportunist"'s paradise (you sound like one for joining the party after its first delhi result surprise) - it has to be dismantled very very quickly and thankfully the volunteers seem to have already started speaking about it. Now to your hypothesis that if every election success (like the one you recently had in Delhi or the one BJP had in the lok sabha elections or the lok sabha elections Congress had in 2009!!!!) you are very wrong. AAP introduced to me the concept that the Indian voter will vote in every election with an impatience that is often frightening!. So they will throw AAP in a moment.

At the same time their chief was shamelessly accusing the BJP of trying to buy the Congress MLAs and petitioning the SC to stop horsetrading. How hypocritical can you get ?? You claim this kind of party heading by this cheater will clean corruption? Do you even know what you are talking about?

                            Ashutosh you are one of the major factors for the current downfall of AAP. Dont you use this kind of reasoning. You guys are grown up men who happen to have followed politics very closely through journalism. Accept the fact there is no idealism you guys just got corrupted by power. Also you all have an competency issue, hence dont hide behind the wall of trying to look and sound naive or innocent (you off all the people are certainly not). AAP has got corrupted completely from within and its all because of people like YOU (who were never a part of the fight against corruption but came in when they saw an opportunity to get power).

                            Oh so now comes this justification for dilution of ideology. You never told people before the election that you will dilute your idealism. I am a AAP supporter and still stick on to it, but you guys have shattered our belief and confidence. You now say, politics will have to be 'patient', 'long-term' etc. - Arvind Kejriwal is on record saying before election, 'yes we are in hurry'. I can give you time for implementing your programme and to that extent patience and long-term are fine but even in the longest term we cannot allow you to dilute the ideology and the moral values that we though AAP stood for. Before seeking votes, Arvind Kejriwal is no record saying 'we want to provide an alternative politics....how does it matter whether I am chief minister or not'...now the sting has exposed his and your groups desperation to be in power. Do you think we did not understand the lust for power and its perks, when on the day of swearing Arvind Kejriwal cunningly said 'mujhe to bas 4-5 bedroom ka ghar chahiye.....itni jagah honi chahiye ki 500 logon ko bitha sakoon'. who was he fooling? You think people do not understand! He was ready to play the communal card for winning election and then in wake of Imam Bukhari's statement when you sniffed there could be reverse polarization in favour of BJP you came out again with the fake morality that you do not want support from communal elements. And in order to form government you offered bribes - ministries/chairmanship/plum postings - this is rank corruption. And let me add I believe that the tapes which have been released are authentic - so don't start thinking that you can get away by saying the tapes are doctored. And now you guys have formed a group of Kejriwal's cronies and as a matter of fact you care two hoots about the core values of AAP but only about your personal interest, which you believe will be served by sticking around with Arving Kejriwal and not with the ideals of the Party. There is a lot to be said...but let me say just a couple of last points, I am not sure if Prashant Bhushan was motivated by any personal interest...and may be Yogendra Yadav may have some personal interest or ambition in arguing that the party should expand beyond Delhi and that unilateral decision making power should not vest in Arvind Kejriwal....but even if there were personal interests involved, so long as what they were saying is consistent with the ideals and values of the Party it must be done and necessary internal systems and institutions must be built to ensure that no member and office bearer of the party deviates from the core principles and values. Arvind Kejriwal has deviated and actually it now appears to AAP supporters like some of us that he always was power greedy and he built and used this entire movement just to serve his personal ambitions. Once such institutions and systems get developed in the party, tomorrow it could have ensured that even if Prashant Bhushan or Yogendra Yadav were to act in self-interest or out of personal ambition, they could have been removed. It is in this context that the job of other leaders of the party like yourself was important to argue for and uphold the values and ideals of the Party - but all of you proved to be real pigmies as you chose to stick to protecting your self interest and become part of the Arvind Kejriwal coterie. Please understand, beyond a point we do not bother about individuals - whether AK, PB or YY or others like yourself. We care about the values which AAP apparently stood for. Please be very clear none of you would have and neither in future will win any elections on your strengths as individuals - you guys are not mass leaders in any way and you have appeal on the lines of caste, community, region or the like. The only way you will survive is if AAP survives in its original form and intent or else there will be no second chance. Also, in terms of governance you will not be able to achieve anything drastically better than what a previous congress government achieved or a possible BJP govt could have achieved (as a matter of fact, corruption at all elves is still rampant in Delhi even after one month of your govt.). So please do not end up believing that you will wash your sins by providing some great governance and thus you will be able to win another election on that basis. In order to win again you will need the values and ideals of AAP much more than a good governance. People can forgive lapse in governance but no lapse in moral commitment and values. Please behave!

                            Mr. Ashuthosh forget the innuendos and euphemisms, the issues are real and your party is failing in the mid-term test to your principles and don't inspire confidence that you will even take the finals. The real issue is AAP portrayed itself as standing against corruption, for transparency and against centralization of power and You have failed on all 3 counts. The efforts to split the motley 8 congress MLAs showed your hunger for power and willingness to indulge in corruption; you have tried to make a virtue transparency only after your inner-party struggles have been made public. Lastly Aravind's manipulation to make himself the centre of all power not hesitating to throw all those who challenge his position exposes his megalomania hunger for power. You have shown that you have managed to become in a very short span of 2 1/2 years all the qualities we hated in Congress, BJP and all others. At least these parties did not try to cheat the public with wolf dyed in sheep clothing....

                            Mr. Asuthosh: You will thrown out from AAP if you are going above Arvindji.  Basically what Arvind is doing is consolidating the entire power of AAP with him so that he alone can control the AAP.  If Bhusan or Yadav who were one of the promotors of AAP, then he has to share the power.  Basically AAP is becoming one man Party like Congress.  There is a proverb. (katha ki beech or malik ke okay nahi jhanaka) i.e. Behind the Donkey or before the Owner you shout not go and if you go owner will pull u back or donkey will give you a kick.  Exactly when any one in AAP goes above Arvind, he will be expelled from the party. Mr. Ashuthosh be careful.  I request NDTV to send this mail to Mr. Ashuthosh.

AK camps shallow and narrow thinking is evident when they turned valid issues raised as an attempt to grab power in the party...

                            It is impossible that scamgress MLA's that you tried to poach would have come without incentives given to them like some ministry or money or post.And u used to call congress + BJP MLA's chor and here you were ready to make govt with support of so called chor. This is party of hypocrisy.I hope now people see true face of AAP. And also remember to substitute AK with Aam admi whenever AK speaks.You would immediately understand than what he wants for himself.eg Aam janta chahti hai ki haam kasi se election lade.

                            It would have been better if Ashutosh did not write this article -- he is once again attacking Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bushan as someone who tried to sabotage the party from within -- it shows the malicious nature of the author. I was actually looking forward to statements calling for unity and rising above differences -- instead he wastes this opportunity to further his paranoid and baseless thoughts which are a result of intolerance towards dissent. Ashutosh himself uses very sharp and self-righteous words when he speaks and I always am sceptical towards anyone talking ultra-rigid and self-righteous.

Internal party democracy.<br/>
Transparent candidate selection.<br/>
Swaraj.<br/>

                            Another shoddy write-up has come up from a master manipulator. Very smartly the writer has hidden his own agenda behind joining the movement which was supposed to cleanse the system. With the same motive Mr Modi became PM of India and the whole world knows how much time he spends to cleanse the system. <br/>
While indirectly suggesting to his warring faction not to beat the morality drum Mr writer has attacked BJP for orchestrating the latest controversy in AAP. Actually this is the actual functioning style of Indian News Editors. They know how to present a news to give it a completely new color. <br/>
Now coming back to the contents in his write up he has tried to douse the fire coming from within by giving a moral lecture that small tweaking of here and there is not a big issue and to cleanse the system it is necessary. <br/>
Writer is a big name in Indian Media. He knows he can easily get various platforms to plant stories and manipulate the facts. But he has myopic vision probably. The master strategist couldn't disclose that he is eyeing a Rajya Sabha seat by being in the forfront. The whole issue of fighting against corruption is nothing but an eye wash. There is an old saying you can fool somebody for sometimes but can't fool everyone all the time.

                            Conspiracy theories won't get you anywhere. Ashutosh, you and the coterie who  push for the expulsion of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan are the real conspirators against the dream that had been AAP. You are reducing this movement to a mere Khap : male dominated, rigid, vengeful. <br/><br/>
By stifling dissent, by victimising people who have differences, you have taken AAP to the soulness party machines of the communist era. <br/><br/>
Okay, you may line up MLAs, you may marshal the mob. But minus people like Yadav and Bhushan AAP will sadly lack the intellectual heft and prinicipled conduct. Also missing will be personal integrity and a guiding framework of ideals that promised to take AAP beyond the muck of conventional politics.

AAP's real strength is not Kejriwal, Bhushan, or Yadav but the millions of passionate volunteers and supporter of AAP who see some rays of hope to change the Indian politics. People are really very disappointed on you and delhi team destroying the concept of AAP. And please dont talk on ideology. All your ideology are open now. You preach democracy, swaraj, corruption etc. Does AAP have an iota of it. Can you please tell the valid reason behind the YY and PB ousted from PAC. They have raised some valid question on internal democracy, principle but you and your crook team didn't liked it ousted the intellectual for whom people have supported AAP. Now dont tell that you are not in NE how you will be responsible for that? But didn't Manish Sisodia called your crook team before decision of voting? Why AK did not show the leadership and introspect it. Ashutosh, Manish, Ashish, Sanjay Singh, Gopal Rai, Dillip Pandey have destroyed the hope of people. Without YY and PB, the PAC does not even deserved to be distric level committee.

2. " It's not about morality. It's not a dream. It's the real world. It's reality. It is power. Raw power.".... Indeed, and you people proved it.<br/><br/>
3. "AAP is being pulled in two opposite directions. One led by idealism and the other by realism. AAP decided to become a political party, but the transformation of a movement into a fully grown party has not yet happened. Till that process is not complete, there will be serious friction.".... So, you suggested that whoever will stick to ideology (on which your party was formed", will be ousted so you have a fully and completely political party.<br/><br/>
4. "... some adjustment has to be made without making any compromises...".... core ideology? and compromise? Does it fit together?<br/><br/>

                            There are faces who are not smiling and neither unhappy. They are the people who have been associated with AAP earlier but were demoralized or cheated by the unhappy ending of the AAP government at earlier occasion. They are the people who had to go back to BJP or Congress because they were cheated by the so-called honest people offering themselves to rule the people of Delhi. They have been cheated twice because in some nook and corner of their heart they were still associated with their first love i.e. AAP. <br/><br/>
How many times you people will cheat the innocent public of Delhi and continue to blame the rival parties, the system, the media and the public themselves. Fact is that you are only here for the lust of Power.

And by your inane logic, you appear to be justifying the attempt to expel founder members Yadav and Bushan,  simply because they are idealists! You are making things worse by putting your foot in the mouth. My advice is to maintain a low profile and let the situation resolve itself. Kejriwal,  Yadav and Bushan are mature men of high caliber. They will sort things out with time.  They don't need you or the others in your coeterie, to muddy the waters any further.

                            As per my limited knowledge goes, there are thousands and thousands of people across the country who still believe that corruption can be brought down, if not stopped. For that, we need people with knowledge, education, courage and honesty to lead from the front. kejriwal used Anna as a stepping stone for his greed, left Anna in the lurch, bad-mouthed everyone who did not support him, and is enjoying life (fake reason cited as health problems)in a resort in Bengaluru at the tax-payer's expense. I still believe if all the volunteers and supporters of AAP come together and hold a dharna (which is the hallmark of AAP) asking kejriwal and his goons to step down, and demand the Yogendra Yadav or Prashanth Bhushan be elected their chief, then things would be alright. Until then, the AAP and Kejriwal with his goons will keep moving ahead with fooling the people and insulting democracy. Volunteers of AAP, are you listening?

                            Notwithstanding all the fancy words, the couplets and the seeming regret, what really stands out in this imbroglio that AAP has got itself entangled in, is the intolerance and total repugnance for any one, no matter who, or how important his stature, daring to think or speak differently from what AAP's supremo Kejriwal does. The overeager and enraged reaction demonstrated by the second rung leadership  in throttling such voices with a steamroller  approach only compounded this folly. In the process, no matter what Ashutosh now says, AAP is being seen as a party where only one man's writ runs, with its supremo, who certainly is not Solomon the wise, reinforcing this precept with his acting behind the scenes, which only makes it worse. AAP will take long and many course corrections to overcome this setback.

                            All volunteers, donors, supporters, and followers of AAP must now come out on the streets and demand that the present leadership be changed and a fresh election for the party leadership be conducted. I bet Kejriwal would find himself in the same situation as is Rahul Gandhi (even though rahul is slated to be president of the party based on his lineage) and be thrown out of the leadership though he might be a CM (pleasure-seeking CM). Next he will say he is affected by the hot weather somewhere and will next go to Kulu-Manali with his family at the tax-payer's expense. Incidentally, his kids' exams will also be over at that time. so family jolly at my cost! No wonder politics is comfortable.

                            Stop cheating yourself and the aam admi. Two things are now clear- one  that anyone who says anything against kejri will be thrown out (so much for inner party democracy ) and kejr will end up being surrounded by sycophants like ashutosh and secondly,AAP is no more a party with a difference.. sad for those who voted for them in delhi and those who hoped for better :(

                            "some adjustment has to be made"..Hmm would u like to spell how much is "some"? And who in AAP will decide it? Only AK and his Bhakts like You? Nobody is  saying no to some bit of political pragmatism and we the AApian did let u get away with that! e.g. AK visiting Tauqir Raza, Shazia telling Muslims to become selfish, 2 Crore Rs. Donation, your high powered city wide spread of hoardings, you choice of dubious candidates etc. U think v r duds and could not see the reality? But what has it all got to do with Bhakts like u and even your sidekicks abusing YY/PB in public space? Yes We have gone through all ur charges against them in details but sorry  we are not convinced that it calls for their sacking from party. And is it really about idealism V/s realism or is it about Democracy V/s autocracy. Or is it about the lust for Power in the garb of Realism?

                            It is correct that politics is a dirty game and Kejriwal also said in the beginning that it is full of mud and AAP has to play in mud and get dirty but at the same time keep its ideals intact. Hence, it is happening the same and when BJP announced before election that they can form the Government then it was very clear that it is getting support from some Congress MLA's. At that tme Kejriwal also played a master stroke by approaching Congress MLA's through Garg. Then the BJP had no choice but to declare new election. Had Kejriwal not taken that dirty step although it was against his ideology then today the situation would have been different and BJP Government would have beeen there today instead of AAP.

Take your forum and talk internally. All those writing negatively are typical Indian crab mentality. Please if you do not like you are free to choose BJP or Congress or start your own party. As an outsider, I am feeling more pain seeing a family memebrs fighting each other...If you are part of same family... please stop this bashing your own memebrs.

                            Please do not tear down on the only hope we have now.... All those who do not like please feel free to start a new clean party on own better than APP and flight against APP, BJP, Congress. Any system there are flaws and lesions to learn... If you really want India to have a clean politics, please participate constructively... Your negative comments are tearing down a hope we have now.... or start something new to create new hope... all those come openly to criticize APP ( instead taking up internally) is kind of bad team playing!<br/>
If you do not believe in current AAP option you have option not to vote next time or drop from participation that is your discretion. If you believe in AAP, then participate constructively….As long as you are member, coming openly debating internal matters, weakens you. When you are part of waken your own team, and then you are helping BLP and Congress. That is what your interest then joins them (BLP or Congress) and then throw the mud at AAP….. <br/><br/>
Finally, I am an outsider feeling the pain seeing your own members fighting each other openly!!!!!! Please stop fighting openly!

                            I understand boy is getting transition into man but keep in mind if values are compromised, boy will still transition into man but to different kind of man which can be curse to society. Same should not happen with AAP. There is no issue in transitioning but principle values on which AAP was formed should not be compromised. High expectation of people of India is riding on this transition.

                            Those who are upset with AAP for 'humiliation of PB and YY' cannot be a well-wisher of AAP. Since what YY and PB was doing, simply to satisfy their ego against Kejriwal, was a crime in any party. It was YY and PB who made it into a personality cult and hence the fight began! Looks like they want to retain the right to anoint the NC of AAP! Defeating AAP in a do or die battle can be welcome for Namo bhakts or such egomaniac lazy AAP members. A mature AAP can take them along, but really does not need them. I want to see those who are crying for YY and PB will ever give a space to them in their own favourite party or tolerate this behaviour in their own organisation. AK is as honest as they are and even more. He left his cushy job and everything, PB and YY did not do that! So much for their conviction for AAP!
