Headline::::Mr PM, We Could Have Saved Govind Pansare



DateTime::::2015-02-22T01:00:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	As I landed for a debate on 'The Big Fight' for a segment focused on the PM's statement on religious intolerance, I had Govind Pansare on my mind.
	Last week, Pansare, a self-confessed rationalist and a member of the CPI, was with his wife when he was shot by unidentified assailants. Pansare's recent views on Nathuram Godse and his criticism of the the right-wing is being investigated by the Maharashtra police as a possible cause for the attack.
	While we were in the midst of the discussion in the studio, Pansare succumbed to his injuries at a Mumbai hospital.
	There is a reason I mention the NDTV debate. In a response to my co-panelist Nalin Kohli of the BJP on the PM's statement, I asked him why is it that the tech-savvy PM, who had the time to tweet about a 10-year-old temple in his name post the BJP's Delhi rout, could not tweet a strong message suggesting that the assassination attempt on Govind Pansare would not be tolerated. To this I was told by Nalin that the PM cannot be expected to make a statement on every incident and individual.
	I have been cynical of Narendra Modi's condemnation of the attacks on churches and what was presented as his strong message opposing religious conversion, close on the heels of American President Barack Obama's statement on religious intolerance in India. And I, like most who are worried about the simmering undercurrents of fascism in the country, have reasons to be cynical.
	Barely a month ago, Govind Pansare had spoken at the Shivaji University in Kolhapur against the increasing glorification of Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. It must be remembered that a BJP MP had referred to Godse as a national icon late last year. Pansare stated emphatically that Mahatma Gandhi was shot at by Godse, who was a member of the RSS, at which point a youth in the hall allegedly associated with the BJP's youth wing questioned Pansare's 'distortion' of history.
	In the past, radical Hindu outfits like the Sanatan Sanstha, which have been chargesheeted in the Thane and Goa blasts, had filed a defamation suit against Pansare. He had written that the activities of the Sanstha which he said bordered on terrorism, needed to be checked and that the organisation was radicalising Hindu youth.
	Months after the murder of anti-superstition activist Narendra Dabholkar in 2013, Pansare received a threat letter stating "Tumcha Dabholkar Karu", which translated that he could also be killed like Dabholkar.
	One of the reasons the Hindu Right was up in arms against Govind Pansare was over his views of Maharashtra leader Shivaji, who has for decades been appropriated by the RSS and many other fringe outfits in Maharashtra, who sought to call him a Hindu Hriday Samrat (King of Hindu Hearts). VHP and RSS leaders have over the years been successful in cultivating an image of Shivaji as an anti-Muslim leader and they have used life-size posters of Shivaji stabbing Afzal Khan, a medieval Indian commander who served the Adil Shahi Dynasty of Bijapur.
	The image was symbolic - it represented Shivaji considering Muslims as traitors. In his book title 'Shivaji Kon Hota' (Who Was Shivaji), Pansare sought to pierce the myth stating, "Shivaji had not become popular because he was just a Hindu king, but because his priority was welfare of the common people. He fought for justice, ensured security to women, and recruited fighers irrespective of their caste and community to help the dream of Swarajya come true."
	In Maharashtra, political outfits like the Shiv Sena used Shivaji to popularise an anti-Muslim agenda which, according to Pansare, continued with upper caste organizations shouting slogans of 'Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji', while attacking Dalit communities.
	Both Dabholkar and Pansare, comrades-in-arms, were dismissed as atheists who were out to deface India's glorious Hindu history. So while BJP spokespersons might argue that the PM cannot make a statement on every attack that takes place in the country, his actions can speak for his words. And here is where my cynicism steps in, and why I believe that my Prime Minister could have saved the life of Govind Pansare.
	After assuming charge as the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who had spoken of being a pradhan sevak of every citizen in the country, made appointments which sent out absolutely contradictory signals.
	He appointed a former journalist and a member of the Vivekanada International Foundation as the head of the Prasar Bharti. The same man, in an editorial for the Pioneer in September 2007, titled "Prosecute these atheist bullies", had written, "Indians are a deeply religious people and a few non-believers cannot be allowed to disrupt national life through their disparaging comments about religious beliefs. Non-believers are just a handful. The 1991 Census data on religion shows that there were just 1,782 atheists and 101 nastiks in India at that time."
	Does the PM claim ignorance over the past of this man whose views on atheists like Pansare and Dabholkar were no less than criminal? Yes, the PM suggested last week that religious intolerance would not be tolerated, but why did the same PM not speak on the floor of the Rajya Sabha a few months ago on the issue of communal violence, after he was asked by members to condemn the viciating Gharwapsi, or reconversion campaign?
	He could have nipped the increasing rabid voices in the bud by stating unequivocally in the Rajya Sabha that his government would take stringent action against any minority or majority who dared to upset the secular fabric of the country.
	Was the PM not aware that by drawing the Godse analogy, his MP was seeking to indicate that any voice which spoke against the Hindu interest would be taught the same lesson?
	Yes, the PM has come a long way to, "My government will not allow any religious group, belonging to the minority or the majority, to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly."
	But sir, you are late in speaking out. We could have saved Govind Pansare and his voice had you chosen not to look the other way.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            In other news, a commie in some part of the world died of cancer, which as we all know, is a communal disease. Modi could have saved him by reigning in fringe elements. We should all hold Modi responsible for that.

                            While it is very easy to give a communal angle to this murder, it is more plausible that someone took this opportunity to eliminate him for monetary gains. It is well known that Pansare has been critical of many other issues in the society. I can't imagine people doing a planned murder to prove their point of view of a religion or about a forgotten killer. So why not wait for the investigation to complete. You will have a more meaningful story.

Yes, he has very critical about SG and her politics and yes, he has been associated with the VIF but what has all that got to do with this murder?

                            I don't know how she became award winning journalist. Journalist should analyse with neutrality. She is always links every incident to Modi and she show her anti-Modi stand. She has the right speak in democracy but she shouldn't speak rubbish. PM's job is to rule country not to tweet on every incident and also is well aware of where to speak and where not to speak. No need of your guidance. Its better to give ur advice to Rahul Gandhi. This is showing the how much low quality journalism exists in India. Very Shameful.

                            It is indeed nice to see so many people raising and writing to criticise Modi for whatever he does and he doesn't. We can actually see so many positives here. <br/>
1. They all think he can listen to them. Because, he probably comes from a class which is used to listening in India rather than the people born with a sliver ( perhaps even gold) spoon. <br/>
2. There is a possibility of change.<br/><br/>
Did these journalist have courage to talk so loudly when Congress was looting the country for 60+ years. They gathered courage only in the last 2-3 years only because one of the government agencies took courage to show the malice in the then Govt.<br/><br/>
Voter does decipher what is the right thing for the country, in spite of the ranting by the Elite English media which is BLINDLY wedded to western media. The same Elite is guilty of writing all that would sell and not write what is absolutely sell... So much so for credibility....

                            Mr. Narendra Modi does not have track record of helping to save the lives of the people being encircled by mobs of majority community but on the contrary he is forced by the activism of the people and western leadership to speak out. But his actions will be nil. Unfortunately he has projected himself as a savior of Hindus but in reality he is making the lives of every Indian under intense stress.

                            Rana Ayyub is right, but for the wrong reasons. The media has raised Modi's silence on such events to such a height that to the voting public it appears that Modi is complicit even when he is not. I find it shocking that Rana assumes that one BJP MP saying something against atheists is assumed to be guilty of his murder. Let the police do their job.  When Surendra Patel was attacked in Alabama, did Obama say anything? No. In spite of the fact this was yet another incident of white racism against black men (it just so happened the black man wasn't black). Nalin is right. Ledaers don't comment on every social issue.<br/><br/>
But Modi should, because if he doesn't the media will make the public think he is in cahoots with bad people.

                            i would like to see one single article on islamic fundamentalism which has killed far more hindus across india than the other way around. <br/>
so called secularists are always ready for a hindu bash , but are always silent when a bomb goes off, on those occasions its all about the "religion of peace" &amp; "innocent youth" <br/>
the more you present this lopsided reportage the more india will move towards a "hindu rashtra" you so much hate.<br/>
and believe me it wont be such a bad thing for the muslims &amp; christians.<br/>
atleast there will be no beheadings. its definitely a cruel worlld out there but its not because of the fringe hindus only.<br/>
report in a balanced manner or you will end up doing more harm than good.

If I remeber correctly, in one of your articles , where you mentioned, I am sorry for the attack on Charlie Hebdo, but wont apologise for the same.I have a feeling you are almost expecting PM to apologise for the attack on  Late Mr Pans are. Its no doubt a tragic and unfortunate event. But why do you drag Mr PM in to this.Please wait for the law of the land to bring to books, the criminals behind the dastardly act.But please don't drag and blame Mr PM for anything and everything.Currently I see a trend. If PM does not speak , we tell why he does not speak.If he speaks we become sceptical.We say," does he mean , what he says?".All I would say is to show a little trust to him .

                            First of all he is not a contributor to nation building in anyway. So are most of the communists. The last agitation from this "mahatma" was opposition to toll payment. It is impossible and not warranted of any PM to condole each and every death that happens in the country. Even though death is tragic to those affected families and those who are near and dear, I feel anybody should condole death, unless it is really felt from the heart. Just sending out a formatted government message does not mean anything and it lacks sympathy. He is not even a national figure. Nobody outside his party know of him. May be some people in and around his locality knows him. You are making a mountain out of mole hill by this  article.

People like you getting an award is reflective of the quotient of   deep malaise in  indian journalism.  Cant you write something fresh and optimistic. Is it so important in your life to link everything to Mr. MODI. If i presume the trend, next series of article shall be Mr. Modi, we could have saved falling leaves, Mr. Modi, we could have saved indian team from losing at world cup,...... Mr. Modi, You could have saved ISIS killing innocent people. Will this nonsense ever stop.

                            Why blame on Modiji, is it because he is Hindu? Pathetic. If I say I am Hindu, minority start yelling as if it is crime to be a Hindu. Grow up people.

                            NDTV can you please list the eligibility criteria for writing an article. You cannot put an argument all the time that this is personal opinion. I mean Can I have a chance to write the article also. When are we going to have independence in journalism not only from for speech but also free thoughts?<br/>
I mean I am getting sick of people who carry on and on with their motives on an elite platform like NDTV.<br/>
PLEASE STOP ITTTTT

                            Funny Ms. Ayub never comments about ISIS or Shahi Imam inviting Pakistan's PM and not out PM but she'll surely try to tarnish Mr. Modi's image.

                            Ms Rana why is that you have never raised any issues against owasi brothers ? You tend become myopic and stop critising for the sake of critising . Just a honest opinion fro me is that you couldn't even have a normal conversation without becoming too emotional in NDTV DEBATE and that shows your thought process.

                            My God, you seems to be so against Mr. Modi. I never saw any of your articles on NDTV in which you do not blame Modi or his govt directly or indirectly. I can write N no of valid reasons to defend Modi, but this time just reading the title of your article made me write this comment for your article. I strongly feel that you have made your prime job only to criticize Modi and nothing else, just like Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyer, and hence, feels your opinions are totally biased. People should not give any heed to your opinion. YOU ARE TOTALLY BIASED PERSON WHO IS SO MUCH IRRITATED BY MODI THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOUR PRIME MOTIVE OF LIFE TO CRITICIZE MODI. Don't know if you are getting paid for it or not.

                            Of late Miss Ayub has become an increasingly shrill Modi baiter.  One only has to watch her on TV debates to see the aggressive, bullying stance she adopts on any and every matter.  This loses her credibility.  It is fairly obvious that she has jumped on the bandwagon following the AAP victory.  She may be under the impression that the Delhi defeat was the beginning of Modi's end and so why not join the 'other side' and claim when Modi is ultimately defeated that she was part of the victorious army?  She is, of course wrong on two counts: a) Modi will be back; Delhi was a battle lost not a war lost and b) Over a 5 year period Modi's good governance will trump Kejriwal's 'freebie raj'.  Her article under discussion blames Modi for the murder of Pansare.  For an allegedly rational journalist, this is about as far fetched as it gets.  In a nation of 1.25 billion people, Modi cannot personally keep an eye on every individual.  There are probably murders every second of every day in such a large nation; is Modi responsible?  Shouldn't a PM of India be concentrating on larger issues such as Defence, Education, Health, Infra-structure and Foreign Policy?  If Modi gets one  defence matter wrong, perhaps thousands will perish in a Mumbai style attack, if Modi gets one health matter wrong, perhaps thousands will perish in an outbreak of an epidemic, if Modi gets one matter wrong in education, India will be left with millions of illiterate people. Fortunately for India, Rana's pontificating will be confined to the waste bins of journalism.  She should be content that in a free India, her views and her musings which I personally find offensive, are able to be freely expresses.

                            First of all he is not a contributor to nation building in anyway. So are most of the communists. The last agitation from this "mahatma" was opposition to toll payment. It is impossible and not warranted of any PM to condole each and every death that happens in the country. Even though death is tragic to those affected families and those who are near and dear, I feel anybody should condole death, unless it is really felt from the heart. Just sending out a formatted government message does not mean anything and it lacks sympathy. He is not even a national figure. Nobody outside his party know of him. May be some people in and around his locality knows him.You are making a mountain out of mole hill by writing this article.

But he is also the 'Prime Minister of Hate and Anger'.<br/><br/>
The man invokes anger and disappointment among the the minorities, which one can understand : he at no point has invoked the feeling that 'India belongs equally to all religions'.<br/><br/>
But minorities aside, amazing to note the anger and hate that he invokes among even his supporters !<br/><br/>
All his supporters continually abuse everyone with a different view, casting aside all civility and humanity.<br/><br/>

                            Lie , Lies and more Lies. The upper castes in Maharashtra have never attacked Dalits chanting Jai Shivaji and Jai Bhavani. And since Shivaji Maharaj is being discussed, why dont you talk about the letter he wrote to Aurangzeb on destruction of temples..... The letter where he talks about all religions being one and leading to the same god... The letter where he states that Aurangzeb is wrong in destroying hindu places of worship.........  Communists can only survive and rule in Hindu majority India...... Can the Atheists survive in Muslim majority nations? In Kerala and Bengal only the hindus vote for commies, muslims and christians vote for their community parties like muslim league and kerala congress.

In Modi they have found a man who can easily be criticised and condemned for everything that is wrong in this country. <br/><br/>
Notwithstanding your personal vendetta against Modi, I expect you to maintain at least a certain degree of objectivity in your columns as they clearly exhibit anti-modi propaganda.

She believes only in commenting on the seemed misses by Modi and his govt...no comment is ever made regarding the activities of the Owaisi, SIMI, IM, IUML etc. We didn't see her come out against the controversial dialogue in the film PK, but she did write about the Charlie Hebdo attack.

                            Most of the founders and leaders of the right wing nationalist organizations such as the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha were Brahmins. RSS was found by K.B.Hedgewar, a Maharashtrian Brahmin, and the Hindu Mahasabha was founded by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, another Maharashtrian Brahmin. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad was founded by M.S.Golwalkar and S.S.Apte, again, both Maharashtrian Brahmins. The Bharatiya Jana Sanga, the precursor to the BJP, was founded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, a Bengali Brahmin. Here, you can see that all the 'Hindu' nationalist parties were founded by Brahmins, and most of them Maharashtrian Brahmins.<br/><br/>
It does not require much analysis to see why Brahmins are so interested in protecting and propagating the varnashrama or caste based Hindu society, with themselves at the top of the pyramid. Maharashtra, being the epicenter of 'Hindu'(actually Brahmin) nationalism in the country, is not a safe place for propagating atheism and other ideas which go against the tenets of Hinduism or Brahminism. The current head of the RSS, Mohan Bhagwat, is also a Maharashtrian Brahmin. So any Maharashtrian, or anyone living in Maharashtra for that matter, who has atheist or anti-Brahminical ideas are well advised to keep their thoughts to themselves, if they value their lives. They have the fates of Dabholkar and Pansare in front of them, if they do not agree.

If it happened even in so called secular west then how do u expect India to be immune from that? It's about time we stop questioning one person and do a collective effort to improve the country.

                            I am an atheist.<br/><br/>
And no atheist should have been killed by a religious group. These are the people who are the most sane and logical lot and I damn every party which associates itself religiously.

                            @draKe: Completely agree. Very difficult to find objective analysis that is devoid of simmering bias towards a person or a community. In recent weeks I have noticed more objective articles in The Hindu opinion pages written by young scholars, who are generally first time writers. The editors of media houses need to encourage that, instead of only relying on well-established columinists who have developed strong biases over the years. Definitely, asking active politicians to write columns is like providing them free advertisements to campaigns. Why would you do that?

                            Better late than never. Modi's danger is from within. He was elected by the people for development and good government. As long as he pursue this aim, then he will get support. Otherwise not. He should remember that even Rajiv Gandhi took hardly two years to loss the good will of the people

                            Well written. Mr. Modi also conveniently forgets his love for Hindi during the instances where he does not believe what he says. It also keeps the illiterate masses out of his communication. His english speeches are only meant for the cities and the educated. Great strategy by our pradhan sewak.

                            Forget about communal indifferences. We are Indians and have a strong respect towards our father of the nation. Any one who supports, try to justify the henious act of Godse or feel pity about him are all anti national fundamentalists and they should be charged and punished they doesn't have right to stay in our nation any more.
