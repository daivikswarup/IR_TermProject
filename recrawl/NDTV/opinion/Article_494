Headline::::Naseeruddin Shah Right In Saying Pakistan isn't India's Enemy



DateTime::::2015-04-07T21:33:00+05:30




                                
	(The writer was an aide to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Comments are welcome at sudheenkulkarni@gmail.com)
	For certain political parties and media organisations in India, persisting in hate propaganda against Pakistan has almost become their raison d'etre. I experienced it when I went to attend a reception to mark Pakistan's National Day on March 23 at the invitation of Mr Abdul Basit, the country's High Commissioner in India.
	"Don't you think only traitors go to attend a party hosted by an enemy country like Pakistan?" a reporter of a TV channel, one of many at the entrance to the High Commission's splendid building in New Delhi's diplomatic enclave, asked me. I was taken aback by the venomousness of the question. I responded firmly by saying that I am a proud Indian and I regard it my patriotic duty to serve the cause of establishing peaceful, normal and good-neighbourly relations with Pakistan.
	These hate-mongers in the media also tried to create trouble for Gen (retd) VK Singh. How, they asked, could a minister in Narendra Modi's government attend the Pakistan Day function and "party with the enemy"? Singh later did well to clarify that his expression of "disgust" - a word he had used in a tweet after the manufactured controversy broke out - was indeed directed at sections of the media that "misinterpreted" his presence at the Pakistan high commission.
	The latest target of the hate-Pakistan brigade is Naseeruddin Shah, one of the finest and most cerebral actors of Indian cinema. He has been attacked for speaking the blunt truth - "Indians are being brainwashed into believing that Pakistan is an enemy country without being aware of the historical background." Shah visited Pakistan recently to promote his book And then one day: A Memoir at the Lahore Literary Festival, and also to conduct a theatre workshop at the Karachi Arts Council. He expressed his disappointment at the animosity between India and Pakistan. "What can we possibly gain from this form of ragging that we practice against Pakistan? It is a bully's way of asserting himself. They are our next door neighbours," he said. Making a valid distinction between artists and politicians, he exhorted: "Politicians will change colours whenever it suits them. But artists from both countries must look beyond the political animosity."
	The attack on Shah came, unsurprisingly, from the Shiv Sena's mouthpiece Saamana. "The answer to Shah's question on why is there so much hatred for Pakistan can be given by those who lost their near and dear ones during the 26/11 attacks. Pakistan continues to engage in bloodshed. Not only 26/11, the attack on Parliament and terrorist attacks before that too were masterminded from Pakistan," Saamana's editorial said. It added, for good measure, that Pakistan's "intentions became known when its ambassador invited separatists for dinner to celebrate Pakistan Day in the national capital."
	Sharpening its jibe against the Bollywood veteran, the Shiv Sena commented: "What Naseeruddin Shah earned after years of hard work, he lost in an instant. We wonder if someone from Lahore has done black magic on him. He was never like this."
	The Shiv Sena is using the right facts to make a wrong argument. No sane Indian will either overlook, much less condone, the numerous acts of terrorism that have been executed in our country but masterminded from Pakistan. The barbarians behind these terror attacks have been non-state actors belonging to extremist organisations, which have sometimes received state backing. The successive Pakistani governments' dangerous dalliance with religiously-inspired terrorism as a matter of state policy is incontrovertible.
	But isn't it equally incontrovertible that Pakistan itself has become a victim of religious extremism and terrorism? It must take blindness and prejudice of an extraordinary kind to not notice that the number of Pakistanis - indeed, Pakistani Muslims - killed in terror attacks in recent years far exceeds that of Indians. Both military and political leaders in Pakistan have recently begun echoing a truth that many intellectuals in that country had been boldly voicing for many years - namely, that the main threat to Pakistan's security and unity comes from the "enemy within".
	The Indian government, Indian political parties like the Shiv Sena, and the Indian media and intelligentsia should recognise this important new development taking place in Pakistan. If we do so, and if we are serious about our own repeated proclamations about our uncompromising fight against terrorism, we should begin viewing the people and the government of Pakistan not as our enemies but as our allies in this fight.
	However, for the ruling establishment in India (which the Shiv Sena is part of), to begin viewing Pakistan as an ally in the joint struggle against terrorism, it will have to counter the forces of religious bigotry in its own supportive ranks. For many votaries of Hindutva, hatred for Muslims and hatred for Pakistan are two sides of the same badge of patriotism. Which is why they cannot - nor do they wish to - make a distinction between the peace-loving people of Pakistan, a growing number of whom desire better relations with India, and those small terror groups that are wreaking havoc in Pakistan and India.
	The longer we Indians continue to paint Pakistan as our enemy, the more grist it will provide to those in Pakistan who view India as their enemy - and vice versa. And the sooner we shed this "enemy" approach towards each other, the more quickly we will realise, as Shah has rightly remarked, that "there are more similarities than the differences between Pakistan and India."
	The two most powerful and reliable ways of making holes in the ignorance, prejudice and mistrust through which Indians view Pakistan, and Pakistanis view India, are people-to-people contact and cultural-artistic contact. The governments of India and Pakistan mouth homilies on the need for people-to-people contact, but do little to lift the excruciating restrictions on issuing visas.
	However, there is also something else that must change. The two governments must remove restrictions in the way of mutual contact and collaboration in cinema, theatre and other arts and cultural activities. For example, why shouldn't Indian audiences be able to watch Pakistani films in our cinema halls, and Pakistani TV channels in our homes?
	Shah's thoughts in this regard are very perceptive. Making a mention of the special affection and warmth that Pakistanis reserve for Indian visitors, he said, "There is a great deal of curiosity and admiration in Pakistan for what India has achieved. They love me unconditionally in Pakistan. They are nuts about our stars like Salman and Shah Rukh. But I also sense a reverent affection in Pakistan for actors like Om Puri and Farooq Sheikh. I feel very special in Pakistan."
	It is indeed time for right-thinking artists, filmmakers, media persons, intellectuals, religious leaders and politicians in both countries (and in Pakistan, one should also include the category of military men) to intensify their efforts to defeat the rhetoric of India being Pakistan's enemy, and Pakistan being India's enemy. It is time for us to help the new generation in the two countries to grow in a new environment in which, as Shah says, this rhetoric will have died "a deserving death".

                            I'll agree with Shiv Sena on this one. A country with which we fought 4 wars and which keeps sponsoring the terrorists in India is certainly an enemy.

                            12 soldiers and 26 civilians killed with 70 days firing in one year. Isi involvement in unrest in India. And still Pakistan is not enemy.. Remember paki army was hiding Osama but pak govt denied any involvement of Pakistan.. Same way Naseeruddin is reacting . I don't know if he is talking about any other Pakistan..  For me Pakistan will remain enemy until it handover gilgit and pok, Mumbai bombing mastermind, release our citizens from the jail, and stop all the terror camps.. I think naseerudeen is so dork and blind to see it so does the author of the article.. Wake up man swallow the bitter pill or settle in pak

                            "A guy had a pet snake that he kept at his home. He let it out in the open when it suited him and the snake bit his neighbours and killed them. The guy rejoiced and kept continuing. Suddenly, the snake grew so confident that it started to bite and kill people in his master's household also. He then started to find excuses in the community court that since his family is also affected by the snake, he should be pardoned". The author's convoluted logic is very similar to this story.

                            I don't see any difference in Sudheendra and the excuse made regularly by Pakis. It's one thing to fight terrorism in your own country and other in exporting the same to neighboring country.

                            Nice logic Mr Kulkarni. Problem is you don't sound convincing yourself. You want us to sympathise with Pakistan!!! Cool. So if a rapist is now being raped, one should forget all and start sympathising with the rapist, not withstanding all the past and future agonies this rapist brought and will continue to bring on you...And as for Mr Shah, he is just an actor who is lucky to be born in a country wherein such banal statements are considered a sign of intellect and more importantly one can get away with it..

                            It's too much naivety on the part of article writer to assume the role of non-state actors which took part in Mumbai attacks. It was a planned operation which included the Pakistani Govt. establishment including ISI and the army. The whole world knows this but not this writer.<br/>
Regarding peaceful overtures, it's all nice and good but you don't do these things when your military personal are beheaded often at the borders by these Pak elements, nor you expect exchange of friendly overtures when every now-and-then, there's this or that Pakistani trained militant coming here for raining bullets on innocents and the Army.<br/>
Maybe, the article writer is living on another planet where dealings are done on emotions but it is urged that he should read the actual reality also sometime.

Mr.Shah please tell these " loving people" to hand over Hafiz Saeed. Please tell these " Loving People" to stop sending terrorists into India. Please tell thee" Loving People" to stop hiding Dawood . Please tell these " Loving People" to stop actively pursuing export of fake currency into India ( Bangladesh discovered a High level Paki Airlines officer involved in such activities)....Ask these " Loving People" to stop airing Anti India shows where the anchors blame everything from the poor condition of Pakistan economy to the poor condition of Pakistan Railways to the poor condition of Pakistani Education system to the poor condition of Pakistani agriculture on India......You only have experience of some elite rich Pakistanis who are more European than they are Pakistani..the hard facts suggests that its the people of Pakistan who have been slowly being brainwashed against India.﻿

Because its  well known facts that Pakistan govt behind terrorism against india. if this wouldn't be true then people like Hafiz Saeed  cannot walk freely in Pakistan and organise big rallies to provoke people against india.and what about 26/11 and KARGILL? and Pakistan was a HOME OF BIN LADEN. Please don't present your misinformation like a fact. we want peace with them but can they stop killing our people? please tell these things to people who are responsible behind terrorism against india...

                            Mr. S. Kulkarni, burying your head in the ground and refusing to accept ground facts will get you nowhere. Reality is that there is a culture of hatred towards India in our twin country that thrives dangerously on itself and on Islamic fundamentalism. Living in your utopian dreamworld will not change facts. Thousands of my countrymen have been murdered by their support for terrorism in India. Years ago, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto publically declared that "...we will bleed India to death with a thousand cuts...". Although she is no more, the attitude of anybody in Pakistan who can influence decisions against terror is still the same. We are only safe today because of the vigilance of those who protect put borders, not because of any attitude change by our neighbour.

                            The day Pakistan learns to face Facts and write truth and change their text books which portray Hindu's in the most deameaning manner thinkable, rewrite truth in their history books which shows that they won 1965 war and gave India a real beating, their TV/news paper media channels and anchor's stop to hold a perpetual hatred for India and stop openly refering to India as enemies and that Indians have committed untold atrocities in Kashmir, stop throwing the nuclear threat to us on every debate or discussion, get rid of every single terrorist and camps and stop raising funds for anti India purposes, then we in turn will address samjauta express and sit and discuss all other issues, until then pseudo sickular guys like you and Naseruddin Shah are not doing India any favours and being naive and taken hostage to the few crumbs of nicesities they are throwing at your feet now and then. I do not consider Pakistan to be my friend and would never trust them blindly. Take action against mumbai terrorist attack, return Dawood, until then you guys are as sick as Pakistan lot and show no respect to those who died at the hands of the terrorists.

                            It is very misguided and harmful to characterize all of Pakistan as the 'enemy'. In doing so, we willfully ignore to our detriment, the common culture, heritage and history that we have with the people of Pakistan. The hardliners forget that in spewing venomous rhetoric against the 'enemy' they mirror the same fringe elements in the Pakistan that  they denounce.<br/><br/>
Lastly, I have had the good fortune to work in many countries in my career and have Pakistani friends. It is remarkable how similar we are as people, however, we need to let go of the hate first...

                            Better we do not pay any attention to the comments of Mr.Kulkarni on Mr.Nasiruddhin Shah's expression of dispair<br/>
Mr.Shah has launched 'his'book in Lahore.Obviously he needs support of Pakistani citizens and hu must do anything and everything to market the sell. The BEST way is to blame Indians for all the ills inflicted by Pakistanis on India.<br/>
Mr.Kulkarni has learnt the act of remaining in limelight and hence he must endorse such statements.<br/>
Both are intelligent.<br/>
But are they wise?

Time and again India offers a hand of friendship to Pakistan, but Pakistan continues to poke us again and again with terrorist attacks and state sponsored terrorism in Kashmir. Recently indian soldiers were beheaded by Pakistani rangers along the border!<br/><br/>
We never attack them , but they continue to poke us ! How is this justified? How can we talk to someone who is killing our own people behind our backs ?<br/><br/>
Oh yeah, we indians are supposed to take hit after hit after hit and still keep smiling and do nothing about it !<br/><br/>

Only one thing I agree is always keep close contacts with your enemy so you know what they are doing.

                            Kulkarni makes the fundamental error of putting all acts of terrorism down to 'non-state' actors.  It shows that he lacks the bravery to tell the truth.  The ISI is not a 'non-state' actor; IT IS THE STATE!  there is little doubt that the 26/11 terrorists were acting with the connivance of the STATE! It is the STATE that is allowing Lakhvi to get away with murder with the excuse that the evidence given by India will not stand up in a Pakistani court.  Well, Pakistani courts are the STATE! Musharef himself admitted that the Kargil conflict was carried out by the army under his control.  The Pakistani army is the STATE!  The Pakistanis embraced with enthusiasm US Secretary of State Brezezinski's policy of administering 'death by a thousand cuts' on the Soviet Union and then used this policy against India.  It was in Pakistan that Osama Bin Laden was found; only Kulkarni would believe that the STATE of Pakistan did not know what was happening!  The list of STATE actors in Pakistan acting against India goes on and on but with 5th columnists like Kulkarni, who have become apologists for the STATE of Pakistan, India has to fight a war on two fronts.  The front against Pakistan we can handle; the front against 5th columnists like Kulkarni will be more difficult.

If Mr.Sudheendra believes that Pakistan is not our enemy, then will he volunteer to patrol the border alongside our army? Will he agree to send his son or daughter for such a duty on Siachen or Kargil with these "peaceful" neighbours?<br/><br/>
Its very easy to talk nonsense from the comfort and safety of our homes and offices - where such safety is guaranteed by our armed forces.

                            Agree with writer. Lets take a step back what creates animosity between Pakistan and India? They used to live together for very long!<br/>
I consider the core issues that create enmity, 1) incidents took place during ill planned partition. The memories of horror of killings took place during creation of two states are the main cause. Both side suffered communal violence in absence of a controlled law enforcement. A peaceful and planned creation of two states would have worked much better and last peace in the region. Announcing borders over night created panic and lawlessness that lead to riots on both sides.<br/>
2. Issues including Kashmir are not helping, Pakistanis believe Kashmiris should be given plebiscite to decide their future. Indians believe conducting such exercise will result in Kashmir going away from India.<br/><br/>
3. Both countries actively operate covert operations in each other countries. If Pakistan support sepratists in Kashmir or Punjab. India also support and train Balochistan insurgents. Terror groups in both countries are actively supported by both countries against each other. Its not only Pakistan, India do it through Afghanistan. Bottom line it take two to tango. It will take two to make peace too. Blaming each other is easy and good for war mongers.<br/><br/>
when Indians and Pakistanis meet anywhere, the enmity vanish away withing few minutes of interaction. <br/>

                            Mr.Kulkarni's tone has changed after the Cash for Vote incident and holds a veiled grudge towards the current BJP dispensation for sidelining his mentors!!!<br/><br/>
In Gulf we interact many Pakis, who are proud of Kasab for keeping city like Mumbai hostage.... there are those who love the 'Khans'... but equally hate Sunny Deol and Amitab!!!<br/><br/>
and about Pak suffering from Terrorism.. its their problem.. its their home grown terrorists... who are not independent players..... they are state sponsored!!!

                            I would stay away from a murderous neighbor. Pakistan has murdered lakhs of Indians through Punjab and Kashmir terrorism, 26/11 etc.<br/>
I would also stay away from a neighbor with contagious life-threatening diseases. Pakistan's Taliban is just a step away from spreading in India.<br/>
I would sure not attend my neighbor's conception/birthday party if he is both murderous and having contagious life-threatening disease. Pakistan is such a neighbor.<br/><br/>

I have deep respect for all pak artists but I value the lives of my indian brothers and sisters irrespective of religion.

How can they do so by ignoring the fact that most of these heinous crimes have been sponsored by Pakistani Government.  I think none of these two persons near and dear have been killed  by Pakistani terrorists. Had they felt the pain of loosing the dear one, they would not have commented like this.

                            Good article by a sane Indian journalist. India is an enemy of itself. Its true fight is within. The Brahmin manipulating to gain supremacy and control the lower caste Hindus to stay loyal to them. The lower caste being brain washed to accept the Brahmin non achievable agenda of global power. To keep the plebs in tow, a hate focal point has to be established and that is Pakistan. Pakistan being proud and hot blooded nation react. This suits the Brahmin, because the retaliation of Pakistan gives them ammo to whip up the Indian masses, at the same time keep the masses as loyal followers. It is this inner fight that is causing India to creak at the joints. The end result of this misguided few in the establishment who make the policies, will either lead to a catastrophic nuclear war or to India breaking up as a union, into many different nations. India in its current configuration has got itself heading to a dead end.

                            The author's argument has a few flaws. First, as he acknowledges numerous terrorist attacks have been launched in India with support from Pakistan. Second, Pakistan's internal turmoil (internal terrorism) is a product of Pakistan's policy for many years. They supported Taliban and other terrorist groups. Now they are paying the price. To me this shows, that India is not Pakistan's enemy.  Pakistan's enemies are inside their own country. On the other hand, as long as Pakistan sponsored terrorism and attacks across the border does not stop, how does one expect India to extend a hand of friendship? If Pakistan's hands over terrorists who attacked India and puts a complete end to cross-border terrorism, then and only then one can say that Pakistan is not a threat. When individual Indian citizens (whether a celebrity like Shah or any other person) visits Pakistan they are treated well. I have heard numerous stories of great hospitality. But that should not be confused with Pakistan being India's friend. They are not there yet. They need to show sincerity, end violence against India and bring criminals (who attacked India) to justice.

                            Dear Mr Kulkarni,<br/>
I am not getting into what you have written is right or wrong but my only one question to you is <br/><br/>
"Why in recent times you are so much inclined towards or have very very soft corner for pakistan or for that matter muslim community?"

                            Please dont forget Naseeruddin Shah's brother fought in the 1971 war against Pakistan and retired as a Major General. Both Shahs are patriotic minded. Naseeruddin is entitled to his views which does mot make him an anti national!

                            I think it is also pertinent to ask if India is doing all it can do protect itself and gain a stronger negotiating position. Will anybody dare to attack Russia and China the way India gets attacked by Pakistan ?  They also have internal issues. Have we done all we can to make sure that there is no internal support to terror and take a stand, one way or other on Kashmir. Most of the time we continually try to appease both internal and external parties instead of removing articles like article 370 and acknowledging that we are indeed in a state of unstated war with Pakistan. There has been no progress on 26/11 and there continues to be terrorism against India. Unless we have a clear-cut and sustained stand against these issues we will not progress. Why are we doing nothing for Ghar Vapsi of Kashmiri Pandits, but all we can for Ghar vapsi of militants who crossed-over. In the same way why we are not giving rights to Hindu refugees from Pakistan?  Certain situations can get solved only if you take a clear stand which may get a strong push back for short term. Regarding Teangana, Government had to face lot of opposition, but it was better that it was followed through. Same manner if we believe complete integration of J&amp;K is right it is better to do it than perpetuate Muslim majority which is conducive to terror.  Friendship and enmity do not matter, what matters is that we should what is right for us. We need not sit in moral judgment over others.

                            Dear  Mr Kulkarni,<br/><br/>
I am afraid that you saying that "Naseeruddin Shah is right" is misplaced because both you and Mr Shah are wrong. India/Indians have never said that Pakistan is India's enemy. It is a fact that both India and Pakistan are not cordial neighbours. Period . Thats it.The reactions of Indians to the overreaching unrealistic friendly overtures from the likes of Mani shankar Iyer make it appear like that.<br/>
The likes of Mani Shankar Iyer must remain normal and allow the Governments in power of both the countries to decide on this relationship. We must stop thinking that ABSENCE OF FRIENDSHIP is ENEMITY.

                            Great intellectuals like Sureendhra hate all shiv sena but love all pakistan.<br/>
I am sure many pakistani citizens would have nothing to do with India. They would just like to enjoy their life.But when as a Gov, Pakistan is killing our Jawans &amp; killing innocent people I fail to understand how that can be considered as friendly gesture.

                            Agree with the author fully. People from N-E are hounded and racially abused daily in mainland India. That does not mean that I do not love all of India and Indians whether they are punjabi,gujarati,marathi or kannadiga. I do not carry a mindset that paints all Indians as racists. Same applies for our neighbor Pakistan. Terrorist acts and Terrorists should be condemned and pursued to hell if required.But its stupid to say all Pakistanis are terrorists, just like its stupid to say all Indians are racists.

                            Completely agree.In fact the shiv sena is the one who needs to answer many questions-their record of anti -south indians ans anti -north indians is what I would call as being that of traitors.And all these politicians across party lines who loot the country resulting millions of their countrymen suffering-these are the traitors.Agreed there are elements in Pakistan who are troublesome but many of our own people are worse.This propaganda against Pakistan is only benefitting arms-producing countries and vested interests in both India and Pakistan while the common man of both countries are suffering.A big problem is the Indian media which has a big role in prejudicing the public against Pakistan and brain washing the public as one can see from the comments here.

                            Utterly and ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL RUBBISH. <br/><br/>
After all the lives lost, the blood spilt, the soldiers martyred, the damage and destruction to property and even an attack on the heart of India's democracy - we have some FOOLS and TRAITORS saying "Pakistan is not India's enemy" ??<br/><br/>
These sickening people don't deserve to be Indians - let alone in the BJP.

                            Let me ask Mr. S. Kulkarni this: If your neighbour sets your house on fire and then the torch slips out of his hand and burns his own house, how will you look at it? Will you still sympathise with him?<br/>
The real assessment of Pak attitude towards India is not measured by their hospitality towards you, Mr. Kulkarni. Stop pleasing yourself. Dont place yourself above everyone else who has been murdered by terrorists from Pakistan.

                            dudh ka jala chanch se bhi darta hai - but hate only breeds more hate - if pakistan demonstrates visible and credible long term and unflinching steps to unravel this viscous cycle it has perpetuated and stops this needless brandishing of self defeating machoism - maybe just maybe india will be its first friend that will hold its hand on its journey of achieving its potential - till then i am afraid we can be nothing more than silent observers of its self destructive attitude. No one from the outside can tell pakistan what it should do - it must find its soul itself and then India could be its greatest friend
