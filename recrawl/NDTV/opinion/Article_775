Headline::::Why I Am Dawood Ibrahim



DateTime::::2015-08-23T00:02:00+05:30




                                I am Dawood today, tomorrow, I'll be Mahood, and the day after, Robin Hood.
I cry freedom.
It is customary for smart cookies to blurt uneasy statements, like I've made, and then to say, "I have been misquoted." Let me set this one right. I have not been misquoted.
Misquoting is not the only, or major, mischief that media can play. What is more common, and certainly, most mischievous is to quote correctly in the incorrect context. But then, that is not "quoting correctly" at all. But let that be.
What was the correct context?
I had finished a nearly 3-hour long session with the Delhi Commission for Women on August 19, 2015. Time was close to 6 pm. Even so, I had found the time to address - in fact indulge - the media fraternity. I had been posting for three days continuously on Facebook, specially addressing my media friends on my eagerness to help them with anything they wanted. I had offered, quite seriously, even to be photographed with my face covered, as rapists and murders are, to lend some masala to their reports. This I did, knowing that, going by facts, it could be heartrendingly sterile for them. I did not hear from them on this and so did not carry a suitable towel or black piece of cloth with me. So, if they lost a photo-op, I am not to blame.
I had a civilized session in the conference room of the Commission. I could see that what I said, being factually sober, was a huge disappointment to those who had waited for me for that long.
Men and women in the media have now attained a fair degree of stoic resignation. Most of the reporters present swallowed their disappointment and decided to leave me alone. All, except one. He decided to rush down and lie in wait for me. I was efficiently ambushed at the exit. A volley of questions, beginning precisely with the question that I had said I won't be able to answer in the session just concluded. In my opinion, this is what no self-respecting human being -even a TV reporter- should do. There must be some limit somewhere. The fact that you have a camera with you, gives you no license to be a gadfly to anyone and everyone at will. Heavens are not going to fall if some courtesy, if not manners, is extended.
So, in a flash I decided to play ball with him. These are things one does instinctively, like swatting a fly from one's nose. In other words, not in a premeditated fashion. The only name that came to my mind - as the one that carried maximum opprobrium - was that of Dawood Ibrahim. The name of Lalit Modi would certainly have not done. Given his magic connections spread over many parties, he (or his well-placed friends) would have sued me for damages had I said "I am Lalit Modi". An impecunious college Principal passing off as Lalit Modi? Unthinkable. It is a risk I could not have taken. I could not have said "I am Veerappan".  He is no more and, though I look convincingly ghostly, I still retain corporeality. So that was not an option. The only other name that carries - thanks to the media - extreme opprobrium is my own. What is the fun in saying (or, as the malicious mischievousness of Indian Express puts it with a flourish of terminological inexactitude, "screaming") "I am Valson Thampu... I am Valson Thampu"
So the reader, if not my media magnates, can understand my limited options in the given scenario.
Now what was I doing? Let me put it bluntly...   I WAS CLOWNING...  A 64-year old man clowning? The Principal of a college clowning? A priest clowning? Yes, clowning. What else can I do? Faced as I am with a situation of elaborately organized, heartlessly pursued, diabolically sustained persecution, with no material, judicial or social capital to defend my dignity and integrity (all that I am left with in the evening of my life) .... attacked for turning left.... vilified for turning right.... condemned for walking straight.... I have only two options.
One... to surrender and live in fear and serfdom. Two... to stand on my right to be free - to be free, especially free from fear, including the fear of the media. Freedom is for me dearer than life... So renouncing my freedom was/is not an option. The question then is... how am I to express my freedom in this Kafkaesque situation?
The only mode of expressing my freedom available to me (and persons like me who, in the words of Gurudev Tagore, do not want to bend their knees before insolent might) is clowning.
In an oppressive context, only a clown is free. Those who have a nodding acquaintance with Shakespeare know that the court fool is freer than the king. All else, except the clown, will freeze into fearful conformity. Clowning is an acted satire. (The point of satire, which you will easily make out, if you see the video, was denouncing the attempt to "politicize" the pursuit of justice. It is so very obvious, but the reporter - true to character- can't see it.) When an entire industry is working over-time to rob me of my integrity and dignity, there is only one way I can express the truth about myself in the face of the avalanche of malice cast at me, and that is to counterpoint this theatre of cruelty with clowning. I must have the freedom at least to do that!
Make no doubt, when a society becomes subhuman, only clowns remain free to express themselves. The other option is to live like conditioned animals, unable or afraid even to distinguish between freedom and slavery. I believe in freedom. For me freedom is a synonym for life itself. I would rather laugh my way to prison than live like a slave of fear outside of it. I urge all those who care for their humanity to cast off fear. Fear shuts up not only your mouths but also the very door of your life. Fear degrades life into a tomb.
One last word about being Dawood Ibrahim... I understand that in martial arts, one of the tactics of self-defense is to move in the direction of the push. At a time when the media as a whole - print and electronic - is straining all its nerves to prove me a felon, it might help me, I thought, to move in the direction in which I am being pushed hard. But now I realize I got this wrong. This has had the effect of the hard-working media mouths feel like lions baulked of their prey. I am sorry about it. So, for your sake, let me say.. I AM NOT DI... I AM NOT DI... I AM VT... I AM VT...  Please resume the chase.... Shall I now begin to run? Now? Tomorrow? Any time. You say and it'll be done... I am 64. Never mind. I can still run a good English mile. Care to try it out? It'll be good fun.(Valson Thampu has written this column only in his personal capacity, and not as the Principal of St. Stephen's College.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Forget the theatrics dear Thampu, and simply quit. You have been around too long. Go, and speedily. You have long outstayed your welcome.

                            There is some allegation against you, Mr.Thampu. If your not guilty or otherwise,say so. Now,what is it that u are beating about the bush. Far more serious charges were (and still are) being levelled on a particular party and its leader(who by the way is the PM of this country now) for a number of years ,by so called conscience keepers of this country.People who drenched with the blood of 3000 Sikhs and watched with glee the slaughter of 10,000 innocent tamils in Srilanka  had no qualms in calling this man 'maut ka saudagar' and people who butchered political opponents in thousands in West Bengal nodded their head in agreement.But the man concerned was silent and stoic. Truth can be drowned in calumny and there is no point in whining about that. Take heart from none other than our PM.  Being the man of Holy Book you may not be unfamiliar with what the Good Shepherd Himself have to say about  self righteous and deceitful-    'let him who is without sin cast the first stone'.

                            The standards of journalism in India have fallen - this article is a glaring example of the fallen standards. <br/><br/>
It seems NDTV has made its mission to give space and voice to perverted uncle types - considering the frequency at which "Abhishek" of the of the Singhvi-brand and "Digvijay" of the "Diggi raja" fame and several other men who have defended the rapist "Tejpal" of Tehelka appear on its programs and in the website.<br/><br/>
The entire article is a nonsensical rambling of a megalomaniac. Thampu has been indulging in Modi baiting for a long time, he has been 'concerned' on phony cases of church burning, 'minority' abuse and rise of hyper nationalism. He calls this expression of opinion - his "freedom",  while at the same time he is loathed to give same freedom to people who are questioning him on his perverted proclivities.<br/><br/>
Like typical socialite coward Mr Thampu dabbles in politics from the side lines - because once he is in the political-arena his titles of Reverend, Father or the Principal would not matter. He will have to take and absorb the hits from his opponents.<br/><br/>
He is Dawood and then he will be Mahood (not sure which one) and then somehow he will be Robin Hood. Hopefully in his last form this chemellion  will be Velson Thampu so that authorities can bring justice to his victims.

                            The true characterization of media is done by JKRowling in Harry Potter. The character is Rita Skeeter. Reverend must be a Harry Potter fan because he also compares reporters as a pestering fly. Rita Skeeter was also an (unregistered) animagus as a fly.

                            Everywhere one turns, there's mob justice. A the mob is small , it is condemned. If it's a large mob, we give it societal sanctity. What nobody cares is to go into what the target of the mob did.. in this case principal Thampu. He is trying to put across his his point from what he knows about the alleged complaint of sexual harassment against a third individual. His understanding may be wrong, but can't he be granted an opportunity to explain his point? Even the prof accused of harassment needs to be heard out. Why on earth not Mr Thampu? If this goes on, none of us are safe from a mob free-for-all.

                            I have had the privilege, the honour and the pleasure of studying in a Jesuit school and college. What I remember about the leadership team was the quiet dignity, self control and the gravitas the senior Jesuits would display in the face of various provocations. I hope the quality of leaders in Jesuit education space has not dropped as fast as the political discourse in the country. I remember my teachers to be great people.. You are as you say sir.. A clown. Such responses are a disgrace to both the educational institution you head as well as the religious order you unfortunately are part of. Please leave before doing more damage.

                            Nothing can justify Valson Thampu shielding a rapist, if at all. However, media hounding individuals is also an equal to sexual harassment, if not more. In today's context, while speaking to media, one must always carry a disclaimer: "I am responsible for what I say, not for what you understand". Often media invents insane interpretations of statements to fervently demand for sane justifications.
