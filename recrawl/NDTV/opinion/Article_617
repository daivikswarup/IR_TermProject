Headline::::Modi Got $22 Billion in Deals From China. Pak Got 46 Billion.



DateTime::::2015-05-18T17:15:00+05:30




                                The mountain has heaved. And produced the tiniest mouse. What's with our media, I am at a loss to understand. Every time Modi travels abroad, such an atmosphere is built up as to suggest that something dramatic, unanticipated, with the most far-reaching consequences is in the offing. And when nothing of note happens, they lather themselves into a frenzy over the next visit abroad as if something dramatic, unanticipated, with the most far-reaching consequences is in the offing.
And then when nothing of note happens...and so on and so forth.
Thus with Modi's China visit. The headlines and the shrieking of anchors on the eve of the visit suggested that the trip was "historic", full of a rich "symbolism" heralding a "breakthrough" on the border dispute, signalling India's emergence as a recognised regional, even global, "power", and that China would gracefully yield centre-stage to the upcoming giant, India. The proof proffered was that the Chinese President would be thrusting protocol aside to travel out of Beijing to the ancient, history-imbued town of Xi'an to receive Modi and walkabout the town with him.
Everyone forgot that a visit to China without going to Xi'an is like a visit to India without a trip to Agra. Not only is virtually every Indian VIP taken there, Xi'an was inevitably included in Rajiv Gandhi's truly "historic" and "breakthrough" visit to China in December 1988. How can Xi'an not be included in the itinerary when Huen Tsang (as we learned to spell his name at school) was from Xi'an and took Buddhism with him from Nalanda to his home town? Also, since Modi during the election campaign had shown that he could not tell Takshila from Nalanda, perhaps the subtle Chinese were signaling something significant by beginning their education of the Indian Prime Minster by receiving him in Xi'an. The implied slight was cleverly covered up by pointing to Xi'an being the home-town of their present President, thus lending a personal touch to the reception. Of course, Deng Xiaoping did not receive Rajiv in Xi'an - for the good reason that Deng's mother had failed to travel to Xi'an to give birth to Deng there. But that apart, while it would be churlish to overlook the fact that President Xi did break protocol to receive Modi in Xi'an, overplaying the friendly gesture to make it seem as if special honours were being reserved for the Indian PM because something special was imminently going to happen was so off the mark that 24 hours later the Joint Statement (and it was no more than that - just a "statement", not a "declaration", not an "agreement", just an ordinary, run-of-the mill "statement") said nothing on the border that had not been said before, ad nauseum.
I remember the same mistake being made when Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, broke protocol to receive Rajiv Gandhi at Heathrow on his first visit to the "sceptered isle". The irrepressible RK Karanjia, founder-editor of Blitz, who was in the PM's media team, ran the headline "Britannia waives the Rules"! But far from the personal gesture leading to special warmth, differences surfaced the minute she discovered that Rajiv was not a "supply-sider" like her in economic policy and that on the bitter question of ending apartheid in South Africa, she had met her match. Gestures do not add up to policy changes.
All that emerged from Modi's conversations with the President and PM of China was a reiteration of the assertion that the border dispute requires a "political solution". Obviously. The alternative is a "military solution" - and everyone but retired generals with bristling moustaches on TV know that a military solution is no solution. We can go to the brink of war - if we are stupid enough to do that - but any attempt by either side to find a "military solution" would spell disaster. The border can only be solved when India stops insisting that every stray strand of Mother India's hair has to be saved from the grasping Chinese, and the Chinese recognize that impossible demands like claiming all of Arunachal Pradesh as "South Tibet" will not play.
When, if ever, such good sense prevails on both sides of the border, then perhaps a "political solution" would prove feasible. Meanwhile, the sensible thing to do is to keep the border under negotiation while we get on with everything else. That was what Rajiv Gandhi achieved in December 1988, which is why his visit was a "historic breakthrough".
And Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, now the Rashtrapati, followed through six years later, with the 'Agreement on Peace and Tranquillity at the Border' that has kept moustchioed generals from doing something stupid. That too has proved historic. Nineteen rounds of conversation between high-level Special Envoys of the two countries have kept the border tranquil, if not resolved. Differences have not spilled over into armed conflict.
Compared to those achievements, Modi's visit has concluded with no more than platitudes. It should not have been expected that there would be anything more than platitudes. For these platitudes disguise the fact that so long as platitude follows platitude, bombs will not be following bombs. That is maturity. Which is why every Prime Minister following Rajiv has made the trip to China. And every Chinese Prime Minister has flown the skies from Beijing to Delhi. That is necessary to keep the ship on even keel. To that extent, Modi's annual pilgrimage to Beijing was required and is to be welcomed.
But pretending that $22 billion of deals for India is comparable to the $46 billion that terrorism-exporting Pakistan has got from China is to kid ourselves. China remains Pakistan's best friend. That need be no cause for concern if we bring normalcy to our relationship with Pakistan. It is Indian hostility to Pakistan that gives China the opportunity to needle us there. A sensible policy would be to prioritize the normalization of our relations with Pakistan over every other foreign policy imperative. But Modi has needlessly blocked that route. And, therefore, President Xi's visit to Pakistan on the eve of Modi's visit to China must be chalked up against Modi.
He has travelled abroad 18 times in his first 12 months in office. Why not a few Indian villages in distress for a change?

                            Modi is visiting countries to bring development to India... He is working hard to change the lethargic image of our country that you guys have created... His trips are aimed at bringing development to the country so that villages can have better facilities... It is more important to do that rather then seek a photo opp in some farmer's house who by the way is in such backward state due to your govt looting our country for 60 years...

                            What's with our media, I am at a loss to understand.  Every time Mani the moron pens an article, something different is expected.  What we get is the 'same old' from this pathetic figure, incapable of even growing a bristling moustache and making do with the typical babu moustache of the 1940s!  There has to be the customary Modi bashing and there has to be the customary Rajiv (Mr Borfors) praising.  Mani the moron, accurately described as a snivelling babu by Tavleen Singh, deliberately does not mention that the Chinese border problem started with his hero Nehru, through his 'Forward' policy sent thousands of ill trained, ill armed and virtually starving Indian soldiers to their deaths.  As for his hero standing up to Margaret Thatcher, well, Mani the moron can live in cloud cuckoo land!  Rajiv had no effect on South Africa whatsoever!  The US boycott, with companies like Coca Cola pulling out was responsible for that.  Neither Thatcher nor any other world leaders thought Rajiv was anything but a chancer!  Does Mani the moron seriously believe that British intelligence did not know about Rajiv's penchant to take bribes?  Of one thing Mani the moron can be sure; his views do not count for anything.  His only use these days is to be invited to pen articles and go on panel shows so that there is a contrarian view presented.  Otherwise every TV studio and every newspaper will be accused of being biased and not presenting any views other than those of the BJP!  Sadly, all Indians will have concluded that Mani the moron's new hero Rahul would have been laughed out of New York unlike Modi who held thousands of Indians enthralled in Madison Square Gardens.  A similar fate would have awaited said Rahul in Australia, Canada, Shanghai and indeed any other part of the world.  No wonder Mani the Moron's little hero had to go on an anonymous vipasana to an unknown part of the world.  After all, Mani the moron would have been suicidal had the public started shouting 'Modi, Modi' whenever they saw little Rahul as happened when he went to a cricket match in Mumbai!

They seemed to be really non-aligned to everything within and without, and eventually made our country insensitve.

Alternatively how about NRI PM, especially given his fan following among that segment? One wonders if that would do more justice to his approach &amp; priorities?<br/>

There you go again with your senseless criticism. For the 1st time in India , India is engaging the world to improve trade and get foreign capital to invest in India. Modi gets it. Development and jobs will come ONLY if we 'make in india' and that is not entirely possible if we cannot get capital from outside or we improve trade. Look at your own party that ruled India for 6 decades and look at the condition of Indian Railways as an example. Japan recently tested its train that reaches speed of 550km per hour. Our Best trains run at less than 80km per hour at best. You have ruined the country. But what do you care other than populism, your language skills and trivia.<br/>
The country has moved on. Please move on. Do something more productive for the country

                            Since last few days, I have seen quite a few jokes on Narendra Modi i's foreign visits.... and all people are curious why Narendra Modi visits so many countries, and what is India achieving from it. .<br/>
Narendra Modi is no greenhorn in politics and statecraft. . . He has already achieved more for Gujarat in his tenure as CM there than any Indian state ever had. . . Few hidden (because the main stream media will purposely ignore them) achievements are given below: . .<br/>
1. BJP Govt. convinced Saudi Arabia not to charge "On-Time Delivery Premium charges" on Crude Oil – Young Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan &amp; External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj sealed the deal. Saved the country thousands of crores... . .<br/>
2. India will build 4 Hydroelectric power stations + Dams in Bhutan (India will get lion's share in Green energy that will be produced in future from these projects) . .<br/>
3. India will build Biggest ever dam of Nepal (China was trying hard to get that) – India will get 83% Green energy produce from that hydro power station for free – in future. . . . .<br/>
4. Increased relationship with Japan and they agreed to invest $ 30 Billion in DMIC (Delhi – Mumbai Investment Corridor). That's Rs 200,000 crores by today's exchange rates..... . .<br/>
5. Increased strategic relationship with Vietnam and Vietnam has now agreed to give contract of Oil exploration to ONGC-Videsh (UPA was not ready to take this at all because they were worried about China – and getting into a conflict of interests on south China sea). The UPA had always been on the backfoot about every aspect of foreign policy. . .<br/>
6. Increase Oil Imports from Iran, despite the ban by USA. . Iran agreed to sell in Indian Rupees and it saved our Forex, not just for now, but protected India from future currency fluctuations. India also gets to build "Chabahar" port of Iran, encircling Pakistan. Because we well have exclusive access for our Naval ships in this port. . .<br/>
7. India – Australia (NaMo is first PM to visit Australia after 28 yrs), despite Australia being a major supplier of Coal &amp; Uranium. . . NaMo was able to convince Tony Abbott and now Australia will supply Uranium for our energy production. . . .<br/>
8. China leaning President Rajapakse lost elections in Sri Lanka – Remember UPA lost "Hambantota" port development – read latest report of CIA, where they mention RAW has played a major role in power shift of Sri Lanka. Now Modi has confirmed he is visiting Sri Lanka in April. And Sri Lanka has backed out of Chinese contract and shifted to Indian project managers. . .<br/>
9. With China, as Trade Deficit was increasing, NaMo forced their hand. Anti-Dumping will come soon so China will invest heavily into India. – China has already committed $ 20 billion Investment in India. That's nearly ₹140,000 crores. . . .<br/>
10. On Security – I think adding Ajit Doval to his team is the best decision by NaMo. See the recent tie-up with Pentagon, Israel &amp; Japan. . . Remember I. K. Gujaral as PM stopped RAW's offensive operations in foreign countries. . Now see how we stopped the Terror Boat and listen to his words … "Any Mumbai like attack from Pakistan and Pakistan will lose Baluchistan!" That's the language of deterrence that I want to hear as an Indian. We won't hit first, but if you do, we surely won't turn the other cheek.... . . .<br/>
11. India approved the border road in the NorthEast and around India- China border – Remember just because of China's opposition, the ADB (Asian Development Bank) didn't give us funds during UPA regime and UPA held that file under "Environment Ministry control – Remember the infamous "JAYANTHI TAX "? No one bothered about the disastrous effect on our armed forces. . . .<br/>
12. India managed to bring back 4,500+ Indians from War zone in Yemen and also brought foreign nationals of 41 different countries, which put India's name onto the highest platform globally in conducting that rescue mission – PM Narendra Modi specially talked to the new Saudi Arabian king Salman and told him to allow Indian Airforce planes to fly – as Saudi Arabia was attacking on Yemen and Yemen skies was declared NO-FLY Zone: thanks to this we got an assured clear window of a few hours and guys guess who coordinated this? Ajit Doval, Sushama Swaraj and Gen V K Singh. All in person.... When was the last time you ever heard of ministers involved personally in such efforts that didn't fetch thousands of crores?? Guess the religion of those rescued?? But it isn't secular to mention that most of those rescued from Yemen or earlier from Iraq weren't Hindus at all.. . .<br/>
13. India's Air defense was getting weaker by the day, UPA was very happy to let it happen despite repeated specific inputs from the armed forces, NaMo renegotiated Rafale fighter Jets deal with France personally and bought 36 Jets on ASAP basis. At better than rack rates. No middlemen, no commissions... . . .<br/>
14. For the first time after 42 yrs Indian Prime Minister visited Canada not to attend some meeting but as a specific state visit, in a Bilateral deal, India was able convince to Canada to supply Uranium for India's Nuclear reactors for next 5 years. It will be of great help to resolve India's Power problems. . . .<br/>
15. Canada approves visa on arrival for all Indian tourists. . . .<br/>
16. Till recently we were exclusively buying Nuclear Reactors from Russia or USA and it was much like beggar kind of situation because they were worried about usage of Nuclear reactor for some other use. So only what they opted to give us, we could get. . Now Narendra Modi was able to convince France and now France will make Nuclear reactors with the latest technology in India. On MAKE IN INDIA efforts.. with collaboration with an Indian company as a partner. . .<br/>
17. During 26th Jan. visit of Barack Obama, NaMo convinced USA to drop rule of Nuclear fuel tracking and sorted out Liabilities rules which now open the gates for next 16 Nuclear power plant projects. . . . Isn't this good enough to improve the lot of India?? . .
                         </div>

                            MMS- do you think India got independence on 16/5/2014? your articles make that opinion. You have started finding faults with a government which is in place for 1 year while absolving Cong rule for so many years..I pity you. Why didnt congress make any concrete plans Vis-a-vis Pakistan in all their years of rule? Now you are blaming an 1 year old Govt. for that mess? Wow , I commend your thoughts!

People should judge each of them on basis of their work and ofcourse results. I am happy Modi is atleast trying on many fronts and he has a clear aim and vision.

                            Due to miserably failing to deliver promises made before the elections, Modi can't afford to face the victims of pro-super rich and anti poor policies of his fascistic BJP government, so he keeps on escaping all over the world at huge cost to the country. <br/><br/>
Rather than exposing the truth the unprincipled (and often paid in various forms) hacks keep on glorifying Modi's expensive junkets, which achieve virtually nothing worth mentioning for India, but costs a lot in orders Modi provides to foreign firms for goods which should have been made/produced in India if he had delivered his promised development, which BJP is not likely to do. <br/><br/>
Yes Mr. Aiyar is right that a decent Prime Minister should be visiting people in villages of our own country to see for himself the frustrations caused to people dependent on farming lands, which Modi led BJP wants to grab for super rich who'd bankrolled BJP's exceptionally  expensive election campaigns. <br/><br/>
But it is difficult for even heartless monster like Modi to face the people whose family members were forced to commit suicide due to uncaring policies of Modi led government.<br/><br/>
A decent Prime Minister should be spending the money to help poor people dependent on agriculture rather than on high profile junkets and contributing towards profits of foreign firms. But Modi is not a decent man

Chhattisgarh Rs 26,425 crore <br/>
West Bengal Rs 13,210 crore<br/>
Jharkhand Rs 14,498 crore and many more...,<br/><br/>
2) Selling of 2G Spectrum online earns whopping 86000 Crores<br/><br/>
Congress gave all these things almost free of COST like its there own property. So please stop criticizing him for all his good deeds.

                            Mani, I'm shocked and surprised to see this kind of comparison form a senior politician and deployment like you.<br/>
1. if you see China's commitment since last year (when China was supposed to tour Pak and they did not), India got 52 bl in investment not 22<br/>
2. in this trip it self its 22+10 = 32 bl (not 22). 22 bl is direct commercial contracts, no government deals ?!!!<br/>
3. Investment in pak is more like a grant and a strategic investment to a. access to Arabian see b. regional control c. shorter rout (18 days shorter compared to sea route) d. and most important, its China's supremacy over the neighboring state.<br/><br/>
If you are ready to bend over and hand over your country to China they will invest not only 46bl but will go 1000bl; do you want to do that ?<br/><br/>
I know you are very much understanding what is the meaning and significance of investment in Pak and in India. Dont try to score a point where its not even existing...

                            modi got 22$ billion or more is not the question. The question of the hour is how much have the presidents and prime ministers and other members of the congress looted from India ever since Independence? The congress leaders did not even spare the money and gold collected for the INA under the great Netaji. they looted that too! I am sure that the congress party and its past presidents, vice presidents and the same as of date have looted more than 100 times the investments brought in by modi. Just imagine if this 22$ billion had come through a congress govt....the party president, vice president and other psychophants would have looted 20$ billion and would have transferred just the remaining amount to the govt's coffers. The congress party or any of its bootlickers have no moral authority to question any other party including tmc, bjd, bsp, sp, rld, bjp, or even the southern parties like dmk or aiadmk on issues relating to investments....No other country wanted to invest in India as long as congress was running the govt. They would have to fill the coffers of respective party presidents and secretaries of all the parties under the UPA led by congress and then invest meaningfully in India, which they were not ready to do....so the congress and its leaders are nothing but disasters personified.....Like it or leave it..probably even NDTV would not like anyone criticizing their paymasters...so i would be surprised if this comment could see the light of day in these columns.....but i have had the satisfaction of speaking my mind and the truth!

                            Mr. Aiyer is indirectly complaining congress under Mr. Rahul Gandhi's leadership. Thought not attacking he is complaining from bottom of his heart but writing looks praising LOL!!. Why? because congress has sidelined Congress leaders - Ms. Rita Joshi, Ms.Jayanthi Natarajan, Mr.Chidambaram and his son, Mr. Aiyer himself, Mr. Joshi, Mr. Pranabh Mukherjee, etc., So it's like he can't complain congress or praise congress. So he tries to create illusion in his opinion writings like attaching BJP, but indirectly is attacking congress and RaGa. Nice tactics I can say.

                            Why everyone wanted modi to do in just 1 year which congress was not able to do in 10 years.

                            नगर में एक मशहूर चित्रकार रहता था ।<br/>
चित्रकार ने एक बहुत सुन्दर तस्वीर बनाई और<br/>
उसे नगर के चौराहे मे लगा दिया और नीचे लिख<br/>
दिया कि जिस किसी को , जहाँ भी इस में<br/>
कमी नजर आये वह वहाँ निशान लगा दे । जब<br/>
उसने शाम को तस्वीर देखी उसकी पूरी तस्वीर पर<br/>
निशानों से ख़राब हो चुकी थी । यह देख वह बहुत<br/>
दुखी हुआ । उसे कुछ समझ नहीं आ रहा था कि अब<br/>
क्या करे वह दुःखी बैठा हुआ था । तभी उसका एक<br/>
मित्र वहाँ से गुजरा उसने उस के दुःखी होने<br/>
का कारण पूछा तो उसने उसे पूरी घटना बताई ।<br/>
उसने कहा एक काम करो कल दूसरी तस्वीर<br/>
बनाना और उस मे लिखना कि जिस किसी को इस<br/>
तस्वीर मे जहाँ कहीं भी कोई कमी नजर आये उसे<br/>
सही कर दे । उसने अगले दिन यही किया । शाम<br/>
को जब उसने अपनी तस्वीर देखी तो उसने<br/>
देखा की तस्वीर पर किसी ने कुछ नहीं किया । वह<br/>
संसार की रीति समझ गया । "कमी निकालना ,<br/>
निंदा करना , बुराई करना आसान , लेकिन उन<br/>
कमियों को दूर करना अत्यंत कठिन होता है "

                            Classical Aiyer. All those historical allusions that everyone has forgotten, even if they were true. Rajiv Gandhi died 24 years ago. Who remembers whether he went to China and what he did there. Probably not much considering the state of India China relations till Modi took over. How come Aiyer did not remember that it was under Rajiv's grandfather Nehru that we suffered our biggest military debacle against China. Really inconvenient, that. Cannot wish it away, so better be quiet about it.

                            Mani always has content to bring a lot of folks directly to the comments section. He fires up the patriotism with his single article. He seems to be an expert in counter-intuition. Whatever that secret agenda of yours, Mani! Keep firing!

                            At least on China Congress should not open its mouth ever- for your Nehru actually was caught pants down with China. Congress has been curse on India.

                            Why this man is allowed to change heading all the time, can't he made his mind on what he is trying to convey. 10 billion promised by Chinese government, 22 billion by Chinese companies, 10 billion by president XI during his India visit. With Pakistan 46 billion includes 20 percent contribution from Pakistan and the profit must be earned by Chinese companies of minimum 18% for the investment to be viable. Now this half literate Mani Shankar Aiyear and his illiterate supports can do some math before spouting and trolling more.

                            Not your fault.. For sure congress can not even think of understanding what strategy Modi is following.. If you do and still creating noises which is your birth right.. Shame on you .. Don't forget u r also citizen of India.. What ever good happens to the country u will equally enjoy... If someone is trying to do something unlike you ... Pls don't be a pain
