Headline::::Dear Government, We're Choking. Want To Help?



DateTime::::2015-10-08T14:37:00+05:30




                                Why is it that every time anything has to be done about pollution in our cities or in fact large environmental issues, elected governments do very little and it needs the Supreme Court (or other courts) to intervene? Between 1998 and 2001 the Supreme Court issued orders on pollution in Delhi NINETEEN times.
On Monday, they intervened again and asked why tolls cannot be imposed on trucks passing through Delhi to discourage transit through the capital.
Sure the Delhi Government did, in its budget, in July this year, try and impose a similar tax on trucks coming into the city, but that fell apart with opposition from truckers and the inability of the state government to get the requisite manpower in place. And the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday ordered that an environmental tax be paid on commercial vehicles entering Delhi.
If the Volkswagen scandal has highlighted anything, it is that car manufacturers will do anything to sell their vehicles, including cheating big on environmental norms, so that their profits are not affected. In Volkswagen's case, they produced a diesel engine that did not meet the norms of the US. Since the costs of redoing the engine were very high, they developed software which hid the fault, so that in tests the car would come through clean. But VW is not alone. Almost all manufacturers work at fiddling the norms by sending stripped down versions of their cars for testing. The ones on the road sold to you and me are generally a lot more polluting than the norms call for.
But who gives a damn about whether you and I are slowly being poisoned by diesel (a much dirtier fuel than petrol), which when burnt in car engine (or diesel set) releases high doses of sulphur and those tiny particulate matter into the air, that enter our lungs and blood streams. Certainly not car manufacturers, and seemingly not our governments.
The Congress government, through huge subsidies on diesel intended as pro-poor, encouraged the sale of diesel vehicles to the rich. The huge rise in the sale of diesel cars has been directly linked to the price difference between diesel and petrol. (The subsidy on diesel at one point reached Rs. 90,000 crore!) Its impact in Delhi is said to have been enormous, with the sales of diesel cars in Delhi reaching 50% of total sales in 2012. Car models that have diesel variants out sell the petrol ones, and overall 35% of all cars sold nationally are diesel. Diesel consumption doubled from between 2002 and 2013.
Why does the central government continue to discriminate against petrol? In Delhi, diesel is Rs. 44.95 per litre and petrol is Rs. 61.20 per litre. Why is there a gap of Rs. 17? What starts as a Rs. 3 gap between petrol and diesel cascades into this Rs. 17 gap after central excise and state taxes.
 

Obviously the governments, both central and state, are actively encouraging the use of diesel. And while diesel cars may be much more expensive, the cheaper fuel and more efficient fuel consumption they offer more than compensates for the higher price.
Of course, politicians will harp their refrain about diesel being the people's fuel since it runs trucks, buses and generators, and any hike will fuel inflation. Maybe a little, but we have forgotten that firstly, diesel like petrol, is running way below prices two years ago because of the oil glut, and so a step-by-step increase in diesel prices (similar to what was introduced after the subsidy on diesel was removed), would not cause such great hardship; secondly and more importantly, rising prices will clearly show that there is a policy to discourage diesel cars, which, along with three-wheelers, account for the same consumption of diesel as do trucks. The current pro-diesel price has meant that today most crossovers are not available in petrol variants. This has to stop until diesel fuel quality reaches the level of petrol. And that isn't happening.
The lack of movement on shifting India towards safer fuel standards like Bharat V or better still VI is disappointing (Most countries around the world follow a version of norms set in Europe under Euro I to VI emission guidelines, which impose controls on the fuel, petrol and diesel, as well as engine exhaust, which influences how the enjoy operates.) Half of the country went Bharat 4 a few years ago and rest is following. Currently, much of the country is running on Bharat III diesel norms, which spew out 350ppm of sulphur. That is seven times higher than Bharat IV and THIRTY FIVE times Bharat V!!! There is no environmental reason not to switch and switch now to Bharat V. But again the Central Government has done nothing.
The auto lobby continues to press for delays, arguing that the costs of upgrading engines and catalytic converters (which reduce exhaust gases) are very high since and they need time to adopt these better technology. This may be true for big Indian manufacturers who would have to buy them from third parties but isn't for MNCs, who make most of the cars in India. Their parents already have the technology since they have to adhere to those norms (or at least pretend to) in Europe and elsewhere. Yes, there will be a small hiccup for manufacturers in re-tooling for these advanced engines and emission control systems but is that a big price to pay for the health of millions? And maybe the government can ease the pain by giving a one-time conversion subsidy, paid for by an increased excise on diesel.
And if India switched to Euro V fuel it would make a huge impact even on cars that weren't Euro V complaint since the fuel itself comes cleaner so what comes out of the exhaust is cleaner.
What is particularly disillusioning is that the NDA and AAP governments were both elected on their claims of bringing about change, and that too quickly. Tragically, both have batted well below par in many areas, using political opposition as an excuse for not being unable to make much progress. But in controlling pollution and improving the environment, neither has any excuses. How many millions have to suffer breathing problems or die of lung cancer (after all even people who don't smoke get it) before they wake up to the fact that they are allowing diesel to kill us slowly. Why should they wait for the Supreme Court to issue policy directions? The same governments argue that the Supreme Court should not get into policy matters but are unwilling to legislate improvements to the quality of the air we breathe.
It is bizarre that Delhi has become the worlds most polluted city and the central and state governments that promised us change continue to function like their predecessors. In dealing with pollution, the NDA does not need support of parliament, nor does the AAP need support of the central government. Both could in a day do much to change the air quality in Delhi and the rest of the country instead of listening to a myriad of lobbies.
Since everyone agrees that diesel is the worst offending fuel available, isn't it time to stop being soft on diesel?
Let the Central Government increase the excise on diesel, albeit in a step-by-step process so that the disparity between it and petrol is brought under Rs. 10. Use the extra money for speeding the process of refineries shifting to a higher Bharat V norm by early 2016. Also, if necessary, give some incentive to car manufactures to re tool for Bharat V.
The Delhi Government along should also jump into this and raise the VAT on diesel (even if the central government does nothing). They could also raise the VAT of diesel cars. Together, this would bring a windfall which could pay for the resources needed to man the borders and implement their policy of charging truckers who use Delhi as a transit point; it would also enable the purchase of more buses and subsidized public transport as a means to cut vehicles on the road. In fact, since the metro has been asking for a fare hike, Delhi Government could impose a metro tax on diesel (and may be petrol) so that metro ticket prices are kept low. Given that by next year, the metro will have almost doubled to 350 kms, it is worth doing.
Our Governments must stop pussyfooting on pollution matters, and act quickly and intelligently. Is that too much to ask?
This is what it is like in Delhi yesterday (October, 7) and worse is likely to come in the winter.

                            Not just govt people too should share the blame. In Delhi, most of the household does not have parking space but  own more then one car. Go to Mayur Vihar at night and it looks more like a parking space then a residential locality. Youngsters drive aimlessly around the city and many of them keep the ignition and AC on for hours when eating outside the shops.

                            This is because the average citizen and voter does not see pollution as a major issue. Therefore neither do the politicians. When most Indians are struggling for survival, they can be forgiven for not taking too much interest in the environment. Environmental issues concern the rich and the famous like the Supreme Court and the lawyers practicing there. Not the Aam Admi. Ever heard of any political party making pollution or the environment an election issue?

                            Completely agree. We need to bring down the big gap between petrol and diesel prices.<br/>
Govt should increase tax on diesel by 2 rupees and bring down tax on petrol by 6 rupees with immediate effect. (Since diesel sales are 3 times petrol sales). That will immediately bring down the gap by 8 rupees and make petrol cars far more competitive. Currently the gap is 17 rupees, with this measure it would become 9 rupees. Thereafter, govt should raise diesel taxes by 25 paise per month and reduce petrol tax by 75 paise per month for the next 6 months so that the gap becomes 3 rupees. By next year, diesel cars will be practically eliminated from the new car market and our cities can breathe a lot better. <br/><br/>
The health cost from diesel pollution far outweighs any rise in prices due to higher transport cost. Govt should act on this with urgency.

                            While I agree with your concern and right arguments, similar solution can also be found in 'Comment' section. Mr. Kejriwal also had similar quick solution for almost everything, while he was activist. Problem lies in executing or implementing changes. Its much more complex. And I'm sure you know these (complexities) things very well. Most of the time your views are apolitical, and this time also. Though Such shallow discussion is good for gallery, also raises discontent among few, but who will be ready to pay extra? And who will stop channels (Media) from giving negative (one sided) publicity? Can you take responsibility to stop your channel from unnecessarily focus on only negativity aspect of each news?

                            In Europe also Diesel is sold cheaper than Petrol, so this is nothing different in India. Plus there can be a differentiation on the prices of the Diesel sold to transport vehicles and comsumer vehicles running on Diesel. <br/>
If you can own a Car then why can't you pay a little bit higher price for fuel - to deter aimless driving or have more funds - people will not pay proper taxes but will pay for fuel and alcohol...

                            There is a widespread illusion among ourselves that more roads mean more development. The reality is more roads you build, more vehicles will be put on road. Cars have become relatively cheaper compared to other movable/immovable assets. I've seen cases where roads widened, get filled in few couple of months itself. The unconventional wisdom is, reduce the width of the roads for the private vehicles and increase the width of the roads for Public vehicles. Probably, we will be forced to use public transport rather than using our own big vehicles. This is not as simple as this. But, this is one important aspect to be though of.

                            Sir, diesel is mostly used by transport vehicles, which transport essential commodities like grain and vegetables. Any hike in the cost of diesel will have a direct impact on the end consumer as the dealers are always ready to sky rocket the prices of necessary goods at the drop of a hat. Hence more subsidy is required for diesel. What's wrong if a common man prefers to drive a diesel car to take advantage of the subsidized fuel. <br/>
Instead the government, thinkers like you and enterpreneurs should focus on methods of log distance transport of food through trains and improving public transport with in cities.

                            Those who pollute are able to get away with their deceit as we do not have knowledgeable people and well equipped labs to detect their deceit in time. Our mindset is dated. Govt. needs to spend liberally to ensure that we train people's knowledge to match the latest technologies. Even after the SC pulling up the govt. for 19 times and more in these matters, the govts. have not woken up, as they are either in collusion with the polluters, or do not appreciate the gravity of the situation due to their lack of relevant knowledge. <br/>
We need to wake up immediately, as we pay a heavy price due to the health problems as a consequence of pollution. <br/>

                            Sir don't force but encourage people by educating them the need and benefits of using cycles and public transportation. It will be achieved by eradicating the barriers who link private mode of transportation with their social status and class. U can use my help in it.

                            Vehicle run on fossil fuel and it has plant origin; the non availability of sufficient air flow generates pollution and not the fuel. If we reduced the density of human population per square feet and relocate the source of employment, pollution will automatically reduce. However, this required to adapt scientific attitude in day to day life and planning. However, this is not possible for us because it may reduce generation of black money and without black money we cannot survive.

                            God knows when the Ten year diesel car ban will be implemented, the transport authorities are still registering diesel cars for fifteen years. The fact remains that automobiles are the reason for greenhouse gas emissions particularly the diesel ones being the culprit. Only the NGT seems to support the issue but still giving dates to the ongoing case for long now. It's humanly impossible to check for emissions of each diesel vehicle running on roads and such vehicles which pass the test today may not tomorrow. Thus banning vehicles on basis of age is the only solution to this menace of pollution. This will curb the number of diesel vehicles and discourage prospective buyers from buying them.

                            I think residents of Delhi has a responsibility. Other than NMDC area entire city is full of migrants. Since Delhi people does not do on their own and survive on slave labour it is bound to happen. Stop engaging slaves in your home, office, work place stop patronising street vendors, Ricksaw etc they would disappear. Your affluance has brought population influx. No city on earth can survive with such huge population burden.
