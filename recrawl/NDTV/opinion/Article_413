Headline::::After Delhi Debacle, The Big Challenges for Modi



DateTime::::2015-02-13T21:31:00+05:30



(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi)
	While the BJP's defeat in the Delhi state election has been total and absolute, it is necessary to put things in perspective. Those who are pretending the battle-lines and possible verdict of the 2019 Lok Sabha election can now almost be predicted are surely getting carried away. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Arvind Kejriwal have certainly raised their profile, but to posit them as the key all-India challenge to the BJP and Narendra Modi in 2019 is premature. It may well happen, but frankly, so may several other alternative scenarios.
	More to the point, this election has ended the BJP government's honeymoon and the party's dream run of victories going back the state polls of December 2013. In that sense, for the Modi-era BJP, it is the end of the beginning. That does not make it, and it would be silly to interpret it as, the beginning of the end.
	In politics as in war, a period of heady conquest and territorial expansion needs to be followed by consolidation. In the case of the BJP, this period of consolidation has been forced upon it by the scale of the loss in Delhi. Even so, if the lessons are learnt, and the gains of the past 15 months are assessed and nurtured, then the party can only benefit. Of course, much will depend on what Narendra Modi, as Prime Minister, and Amit Shah, as party President, do.
	Since December 2015, ((2013)) when the BJP won a third term in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, and secured its most comprehensive victory in an assembly election in Rajasthan, the party has grown and grown. It won a majority in the Lok Sabha election, finished first in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand, and was given an enormous mandate by voters in Jammu. In the coming days, it is likely to be part of the government in Srinagar.
	In the near future, the assembly election in Bihar will boil down to a battle between Laloo Yadav and the Yadav-Muslim alliance - with Nitish Kumar fronting for it - and the BJP. This is not going to be an easy election, but the fact remains that the BJP has its best chance ever. A strategic and well thought out campaign, planned over months, since the BJP has a Chief Ministerial candidate in place, is necessary. In Assam, as the recent municipal elections suggest, the social coalition that served the BJP in the Lok Sabha election is holding, and with luck the party could win a majority in the assembly when elections are held there next year.
	In West Bengal, it will be difficult to dislodge the Trinamool Congress, but a strong second finish for the BJP, one that pulls it well ahead of the CPI(M), is very feasible. This would have been out of question even a year ago. Punjab, where the Akali Dal-BJP alliance faces severe anti-incumbency, looks tough. Yet, a divided Congress and the entry of AAP, which can potentially cut into votes of all three rival parties, offers both a threat and an opportunity. Finally, there is Uttar Pradesh, where, to this writer's mind at least, Mayawati and the BSP will compete with the BJP for pretty much the same swing voter.
	If one compares this scenario with November 2013, before the quintet of assembly elections that winter, how is the BJP placed? Then, as now, in key states, primarily Uttar Pradesh, its organisational structure remains weak and bereft of compelling local leaders. Then, as now in Delhi, it is an also-ran with a state unit that is a sorry mess, incapable of winning an assembly election since 1993. Having said that, compared to November 2013, the BJP is in power in many more states and will be running the Union government for the next four years. These are not achievements and assets to be sneezed at.
	Much (though not all) of this increment has come because the Modi surge overrode organisational infirmities. After Delhi, those organisational infirmities will need to be addressed. Bihar will be a very local election, with caste-by-caste, constituency-by-constituency calculations. Uttar Pradesh cannot be won by the BJP state party as it is, not even if Modi addresses two dozen meetings.
	The next Delhi BJP leader (whoever the person is) is in his or her late 30s or early 40s. To identify this person and place this generation in charge of an overhauled and contemporary party, one that has enough time to rebuild itself for 2020 without resorting to wildcard entries, are all tasks that await Amit Shah. In 2014-15, he had only a few months to turn around the Delhi unit and he failed. Now, he has a few years.
	For Modi, in government, the adversities are of another order. For the past few months, the BJP as a political animal as well as key talent in the government - including the Prime Minister - have lived from election to election, pulled away much too often. Inevitably, this has led to an atmosphere of heightened rhetoric and bitter contestation. For instance, the imperatives of a party that is growing in Bengal, and the imperatives of a government that could do with a degree of cooperation by the Trinamool Congress in the Rajya Sabha, have to find a happy mean. When a party is in whirlwind campaign mode, this is not easy.
	All this has told on the government's legislative business, which has been stalled in the Rajya Sabha, and where relations with non-Congress parties such as the AIADMK, the Trinamool Congress and the BJD have not gone as smoothly as was perhaps expected in May 2014. Of course, there is also the likelihood that after Delhi, the opposition will be even more hostile in the Budget Session. Having said that, the long Budget Session is also usually the session where a lot of serious legislation is done.
	Now, with the frenetic series of elections behind him, Modi needs to focus on making the Budget and the Budget Session a success. That is non-negotiable. If he achieves it, he will regain much of the political capital lost on February 10, and will win space too for him and Shah to take hard decisions within the party.

                            BJP was used to look good when pitted against weak opposition like Congress, TMC, Samajwadi, Janta Dal etc. BJP may face difficulty  in overcoming new world of politics of AAP.

                            instead of calling delhi results bjp's debacle it should be called political suicide by congress.bjp votes have increased compared to last election.in order to spite bjp,congress votes were given to AAP.minorities fell for the false flag attacks on their places of worship and voted against bjp.delhites didn't learn the first time,but this time they will.when they finally come to their senses AAP and kejariwal watch out.

                            The author inferred that " this is the beginning of the end for BJP "  just because it lost 1 state . I have no doubt that BJP will learn from AAP and beat AAP at it's own game.  Don't try to teach politics to a person who won 3 times in succession in his state and re-invented the party to win the center.

                            A well-articulated balanced article subtly curbing the extreme bhakts as wells as extreme haters of Modi. AAP has a very good chance in Punjab. Don't agree with the author on situation in UP and WB. WB is winnable with a credible face like Dada brought in with in May 2015. UP elections are in 2017 and they have ample time to put up a good fight.

BJP lost power at the center in 2004 and 2009 . It re-invented itself and won back.  I have no doubt that BJP will learn from AAP and beat AAP at it's own game.  Don't try to teach politics to a person who won 3 times in succession in his state and re-invented the party to win the center.

I used to support this man until he was working as a non political person he and others used old man anna for their benefit, what people can not get in years  in politics he got that in less than a year a smart move by a smart man. He is now a neta and he and his party is no different than other for which he used to accuse others. This election they had un accounted funding, 29 AAP candidates have criminal back ground they gave tickets to imports from other parties like BJP and Congress manged well media  never in any elections media covered some one getting his haircut done or doing yoga.In this election media and other political party did what ever they could to defect BJP and start turning guns on there PM modi.

                            How can one assess the effectiveness of the budget on Day0 - it will be first drafted by the FM...then passed by the union cabinet...then will be brought to floor of the lower house...then passed to upper house with ammendments where the BJP lacks majority...so it will be forced to make some ammendments there...finally by the time the budget is signed by the President it will be in a different shape and no one knows how long that may take...even then at the point of sign-off by the President the budget cannot be assessed on its merit unless it is proven to be effective enough for the acche-din of the common man...God knows why the BJP and their paid journos only resorting to political games and election-maniac instead of working sincerely for the country !!

                            If the science of politics is to be believed, AAP will also need to prove themselves. Rhetoric and copying Modi is what AAP has been doing.

                            At the end, this will help Congress. There are many people who like BJP and AAP. By fighting in between, these two will hand over to Congress. COngress has always been winning like this. <br/><br/>
At National level we need Modi and let AAP restrict itself to Delhi for next few years instead of repeating mistakes. the facts in Delhi also show that all Congress votes moved to AAP while BJP retained it's votes.<br/><br/>
Other states are not like Delhi and BJP will continue it's strength. Maximum AAP can do is only destroy BJP and help Congress &amp; Khichidi parties like 3rd front.<br/>
Even from leadership point of view, we cant see AK dealing with China, Pakistan and India.

                            Delhi election result is handy work of "minorities". Yesterday's program, father/ pastor.Emanuel questioned Country's PM and said " why PM is intervening now, in the attack on school. Is it due to result of Delhi election ??". By this this priest or pastor has CONFIRMED that, the procession Christians took before Delhi election, was ONLY to polarize the election &amp; the result. Buhari was open with his FATWA. So, the Hindus have to become MORE united, against these divisive forces of Christians and Muslims, at least against the priests &amp; Clergies.

                            have you seen the arrogance of the BJP spokespersons, it is intolerable. Every time they open their mouth either they ridicule someone, or they curse or the slang. I wish from the core of my heart that BJP also kicked out from Bihar and then rest of the country. I used to be an ardent supporter of BJP but after hearing Mr Trivedi or Mr Patra I think it is safe to be elsewhere. They think we are all animals.

                            AAP's victory at Delhi would not affect much too BJP. Yes, it is big setback for BJP and good enough to give some confidence to other oppositions like RJD, JDU, SP, TMC that Modi-Shah duo can be defeated as till now all they virtually hopeless &amp; clueless about how to beat BJP.<br/><br/>
Now election are coming in Bihar, Assam, SP &amp; then Bengal. BJP has advantage that it is in opposition there and probability of winning is higher in Bihar, tougher in UP and toughest in TMC. Bihar election comes first and high chances are there that BJP would win. UP - it is highly unpredictable but it is sure that BJP is going to improve its tally than last time. Winning UP is very tough considering BJP has not ground level organisation there and SP &amp; BSP have better organisation &amp; loyal vote banks. TMC again BJP is not that strong to remove Mamta but it may become second largest party and get main opposition in assembly. <br/><br/>
As most media offices are at Delhi, AAP is media's darling for another 4 t 5 months just like Modi was till now but its national effect would be not much. Mindset of Delhi people and local state peoples are very different. <br/><br/>
In one way, Delhi CM is not larger that Mayer of Mumbai or Kolkata. And implementing their promises on ground level is tough task. People would wait for six months and then start to ask questions.
