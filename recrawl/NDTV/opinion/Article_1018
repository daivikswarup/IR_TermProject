Headline::::Why Apple's Old Phones Make Sense For A New India



DateTime::::2016-02-04T13:01:00+05:30




                                Roughly 80 percent of India's population lacks access to the Internet. Apple, purveyor of some of the world's most expensive smartphones, has a solution. As the Indian Express reported last week, the U.S.-based company hopes to import used, refurbished Chinese iPhones into India and sell them cheaply. Later, it plans to build factories to refurbish iPhones in India itself, thus expanding the supply of affordable devices for millions of middle-class and lower middle-class Indians.
What's not to like? In the eyes of Indian bureaucrats, reused phones are that much closer to the end of their life spans. That implies the roughly 250,000 used iPhones Apple is proposing to import annually will quickly add to India's mountains of electronic waste -- a huge problem the country is already struggling to manage. (Apple argues that its refurbished phones are as good as new, and last longer than many low-end brands.)
Such concerns are understandable. India, like most developing nations, is way behind in developing the technology and infrastructure to manage the flood of devices their newly affluent citizens are using and discarding. But blocking the import of used electronics, as the Indian government has long done, won't hold back that tide. Instead, such barriers will merely ensure that the cost of bridging the digital divide is more expensive, wasteful and environmentally damaging than if used goods were traded freely.
Of course, the human and environmental harm caused by improper disposal of e-waste is horrifying, especially in developing countries. But in recent years, study after study has shown that used electronics are primarily exported for re-use -- not recycling or dumping. My own reporting in Guiyu, China, once known as "the electronic wastebasket of the world," found that 80 percent of the revenue generated by the town came from refurbishing and reselling devices and components. Likewise, according to United Nations Environmental Program data, 80 percent of the used gadgets imported into Ghana, long an international e-waste dumping bogeyman, are either working or repairable, and play a critical role in expanding access to technology among the country's poor.
The global trade in used smartphones is growing fast, and it's not just confined to the developing world. A 2015 report from the U.K.-based Green Alliance environmental think tank estimated that the global market will grow from 53 million handsets in 2013 to 257 million in 2018. Many of those old phones are refurbished and resold in the U.S. (in 2014 Sprint refurbished more than 80 percent of the 3 million phones it bought back from consumers). Others are flowing into the developing world (including India, via gray markets), where the increasingly competitive market in used electronics is attracting private equity and inspiring newspaper columnists to explain how to buy used iPhones for cheap.
That's good for Internet-hungry consumers who can't afford new devices, whether they're in India or Indiana. But it's also very good for the environment. According to Apple, 84 percent of the carbon emissions associated with the iPhone 6s come from manufacturing; only 10 percent come from usage. "This makes product lifetime the key determinant of overall environmental impact," explains the 2015 Green Alliance report. "A device that lasts longer spreads its manufacturing impacts over a longer time period." It's not just carbon, either. By extending the lives of devices, re-use markets reduce the demand for critical materials, such as cobalt, that are extracted using means harmful to human health and the environment.
Apple should be credited for encouraging re-use in India, and especially for committing to build factories for the refurbishment of old electronics there. India and other countries should welcome the effort and the expanded trade in used goods. However, they shouldn't stop there.
If Apple wants to supply used goods to developing countries, it should be required to support those devices, too. Thus, India and other developing countries should require Apple and other device makers to commit to updating their operating systems in used phones for at least five years from the release date of the device, and to provide security updates for at least a decade. (Currently, length of support varies by manufacturer's whim, but can be as short as two years.)
Second, Apple and other manufacturers should be required to release their repair manuals into the public domain and stop using copyright laws to scrub them from the Internet. Reuse requires a healthy repair environment, and Apple could enable one by giving independent repair shops and individuals access to the same information it provides its designated technicians.
A thriving trade in reusable electronics won't solve the growing tide of global e-waste. But it can slow the growth curve, while expanding access to technologies essential to succeeding in today's global economy. India should encourage Apple to lead the way.(Adam Minter is based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk.)

                            Oh please..spare us the nonsense..these refurbished phones do burn larger holes than newer more affordable android phones...It's just that the marketing gurus have been enlightened on the business advantages of selling out their old ware. <br/>
We are very grateful for your concern, but can we sell you some of our old cars..they can be refitted to meet western norms and will spare the environment for those gas guzzling monsters that are produced out there..<br/>
also we could give you all our politicians for free ..that would certainly save the environment, cost less and save India

                            I am amazed at the greed of Apple. Has it ever raised its eyes out of the profit books and looked at the environmental damage it has been doing since inception of the Iphone? Where is the leap of technology that can justify a new model of Iphone every six months? The US consumer is lapping up the new phones and discarding the old ones at a huge cost of carbon footprint and at a terrifying pace. We all love to use our phones but not at such high rate of disposal, even if we can afford to. Now, Apple wants to dump this e-waste into India and make money out of less fortunate souls in India's hinterland. Let it show philanthropy by giving them away for free so that they will not purchase a new phone, thus reducing carbon footprint.

                            OH, the hearts of you MNC's are really bleeding for the poor in India.  Stop treating India like a third world country where you can dump your used goods. India is third world no more in IT. Stop this facade of doing public good for the Indian poor when you are worried only about your bottom line (profit). India is making its own affordable phones which the poor man can buy new.

                            Very good new android phone comes at Rs. 5k which can do all stuff that an iPhone can do. We don't want your waste that would be sold at least double the price. <br/>
What a clever choice of words - 'Roughly 80 percent of India's population lacks access to the Internet. Apple, purveyor of some of the world's most expensive smartphones, has a solution'<br/><br/>
How is lack of internet access to do with buying your costly used e-waste???

                            Dear Facebook and Apple - I have great respect for your products but I don't like it when you mix philanthropy with business. If you are really interested in philanthropy (or environment etc.) then establish a foundation or a trust, it's simple. Learn something from Bill and Melinda Gates - your own country-mates.

Please don't look for a new dumpyard for your electronic waste in India. If you are seriously concerned about Indians getting onto internet - we are absolutely gradeful to you. The way you can bring them to India is - import old phones, make people use and at the end of 2 years please take them all back. You might still benefit out of so many consumer's data (which is what you would need badly as you move forward)

                            If Apple was selling these phones between Rs. 500 &amp; Rs. 1000 I would appreciate the spirit else it just plain profiteering from the branding. So spare us the evangelism and beat it. Those who want APPLE and can afford it are anyway buying it. Those who can't are going for the high end Androids for half the price. Leaving the ones looking for budget phones. And they're not brand conscious!

                            We dont want to become garbage dump of developed nations, Indians already are smart and use cheaper non iPhones. Even refurbished will be costlier then other better offerings. So sod off.

                            Trust me, with the kind of brittle screens they have they won't last a month. And for the price of getting the screen changed one could buy a new low end Chinese phone. But yeah, good for urban wannabes.

                            What if with this plan to import refurbished phones India could put a smart phone into the hands of every autoroskshaw driver, every mason, carpenter, every small time entrepreneur. It would change the way these guys run their business. If govts can provide cheap Wifi services cheap phones will then provide that last mile connectivity. Its worth thinking how these phones could help jumpstart Startup India as they facilitate internet inclusiveness who cant afford it right now. What would it mean for that remote school that cant as yet afford access to the internet based learning tools that are just mushrooming. We definitely need the upgrade to the latest OS for these phones to work with the latest apps. We also need the local repair shop to have the capacity to provide cheap repair services if we dont want cheap devices to be consigned to the e-waste bin so soon. I see a possible win win situation for all here

                            this guy just want to wash off his hands of the ewaste. Apple can say that they are buying old phones selling them India and claim that they are reducing Carbon footprint and care for earth. IN real terms they want to make sure that their wastage is dumped in India and make money from it as well. Good marketing gimmick.

                            Mr Adam. Your analysis is wrong on so many levels.. nothing else but corporate spiel is expected from Bloomberg<br/><br/>
"Roughly 80 percent of India's population lacks access to the Internet. Apple, purveyor of some of the world's most expensive smartphones, has a solution." How is supplying Iphones going to solve this? are you going to setup internet access in remote regions in India?<br/><br/>
Iphones are never cheap.. Apple are just going to charge a lot for these phones which is still going to be out of reach of the consumer whom they say are targeting. And to be fair the smart phone market in India is booming and you get some really slick brand new phones within 5-6k which is going to be cheaper than what apple are going to sell their used phones for.

                            Indians are very sensitive to buy 'second hand' stuff no matter what is the incentive.                                     Even a person who has not used any is offered such a phone free of cost would feel offended.  Will realise this very soon after importing first lot.
