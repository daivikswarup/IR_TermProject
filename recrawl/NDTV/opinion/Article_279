Headline::::A Letter To PM Modi From 'Anti-National Sickular Presstitute' Barkha Dutt



DateTime::::2016-02-20T19:11:00+05:30




                                Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I write to you today because like so many of my fellow citizens, I am both angry and anguished. I am aware that a missive from someone like me - "presstitute", "bazaaru",  "sickular" and worst of all, "anti-national"- will be most likely junked by your office as not worthy of your time.
In any case, ever since I reported on the 2002 riots in Gujarat, I am among the journalists you have clearly shunned and disliked - that is, of course, entirely your prerogative. But this week, I read that you told opposition parties that you are the PM of "all of India, not just of the BJP", and I thought I would hold you to that promise and ask for your attention as a citizen's entitlement.
Modiji, I take you back to the years before you became Chief Minister and began the "othering" of large sections of the English media whom you were convinced were out to get you: when you were the approachable and friendly General Secretary of the BJP, and I was a young reporter still learning the ropes. If you remember those years - and I am told you never forget (or forgive) - you would recall that I first cut my teeth as a journalist reporting a war from the frontline in Kargil in 1999. I was still in my 20s, and the intimacy and immediacy of that overwhelming exposure would make me a life-long admirer of our military. My emphasis, even back then, was to humanize and personalize the stories of soldiers in the trenches and ensure they would not remain faceless, nameless statistics. Over the years, the bonds I forged with the Fauj only grew deeper - my reporting has often taken me back to the border, to the Line of Control and a variety of conflict zones to where they've been deployed. Over the past two decades, I have done hundreds of news programs devoted to the Soldier - the discrepancies in hardship allowances between jawans and bureaucrats, the shameful mountain of government litigation against disabled soldiers who are dragged to court for pensions, the pending promise of One Rank One Pension, the bottlenecks in defense procurement, and the many sacrifices of our men and women in uniform.
So I write this as a sentimental and proud Indian who has often been teased by my more left-leaning friends and colleagues for my rather maudlin and unintellectual patriotism. I would submit that the binaries that spokespersons of your government have created (aided by the hyper-nationalist drum-beating of channels like Times Now and News X) are absolutely false. It is entirely possible to deeply respect the military and feel ashamed of the multiple manipulations, doctored videos, police excesses, government heavy-handedness, brazen hooliganism and ominous environment of intimidation that the crackdown on JNU has revealed. In fact, for your party to use the death of ten Siachen bravehearts to validate the gross over-reach we have seen in JNU is to, in my view, cynically exploit the honour of the uniform. I wish there was half as much outrage when your good friend Jayalalithaa's photograph was placed on the coffin of one of the Siachen soldiers by her minister, who was then proudly photographed with it.
Modi ji, I would also like to take you back to a man whose name you love invoking - Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I remember the tingling excitement of hope and optimism that ran through my veins as I stood among the crowds in Srinagar in 2003 and heard him discard the rigidities of legalism and offer "Insaniyat" as the framework for reconciliation in the Kashmir Valley. Sadly, in its handling of the JNU controversy, the government has subverted the Vajpayee legacy in one fell swoop - I assume with your approval.
Where Vajpayee promised that Humanism would override the literal application of the law as he stretched out a hand even to pro-Azaadi separatists, this week we have seen a singular absence of generosity or empathy from the team you lead. The Home Minister went so far as to link students to the dreaded Lashkar terrorist Hafiz Saeed, based on a police endorsement of a fake Twitter account. Not just have we not seen any evidence of terror links, but it now appears that the video used to slap a sedition charge on Kanhaiya Kumar, the JNU student leader, has been doctored, with the audio spliced onto images from a different day.
In a country that took pride in giving even Ajmal Kasab, a 26/11 perpetrator, a fair trial, a young man whose worst crime (and that's if you stretch it) is that he could not stop a handful of other students from raising some admittedly disturbing slogans - has been slapped and pushed around in court in the presence of a police that failed or perhaps refused to protect him. The HRD Minister Smriti Irani speaks of how the anti-India slogans were an insult to "Mother India".  But aren't Mothers benign, forgiving, broad-minded and all embracing? Stern, yes, when a child needs it, but surely never heartless.
Yet, heartlessness and hypocrisy combined with sneering aggression is what's been on display this entire week. As goons in black robes rampaged through the Delhi court house where Kanhaiya Kumar is being tried, they assaulted journalists not just on day one, but then once again, a little over 24 hours later, emboldened by the knowledge that no cop was going to come after them and in open contempt of a Supreme Court directive. Euphoric from the taste of blood, they congratulated each other on social media for being the "shers" who did "what the government and military could not do". The Chief Goon, Vikram Chauhan, photographed with a slew of BJP leaders - everyone from Rajnath Singh to LK Advani - has been garlanded on the court premises; candles have been lit in "solidarity" for him. The alacrity with which the police arrested Kanhaiya Kumar is in cruel contrast to the inaction against these lumpen lawyers who enjoy political patronage.  
There are police raids across the country to find the sloganeering students who have gone underground; friends who knew them are being identified from Facebook and summoned by the police from towns outside the capital; there are reports of hostels being searched, and landlords ousting JNU students to avoid "trouble". But the rowdies in robes are free, though surely the brazen violence and anti-constitutionalism by men meant to represent the law is a graver danger to democracy than mere words - no matter how awful and offensive - could ever be.
Yet, after all this, it was students of JNU who marched peacefully in their thousands carrying the tricolor and roses, using the gentleness of Gandhigiri to respond to the Goondagardi of the thugs in court.  
Through all this, they may have wondered - as we do - what our Prime Minister thinks. Do you approve of the decision to send police onto a student campus? Might it not have been wiser and more mature to let the university administration tackle the issue, as the Jadavpur Vice-Chancellor has done? Now that it's clear that the "Azaadi" Kanhaiya Kumar spoke of was not from India, but from Hunger, Inequality, Communalism and Caste Bias, will the government apologize to him? And in any case, do you really think the Indian State is so fragile that it would come undone by a clutch of "Hum Kya Chahate - Azaadi" cries?  Because if that's the new thinking, we may have to arrest an entire generation of Kashmiri youth instead of politically engaging with them.
Do you not, Mr. Prime Minister, agree that if you can visit Lahore to greet Nawaz Sharif on his birthday despite the specter of terrorism (and I thought it was spectacularly bold of you), if you can negotiate with Naga secessionists and proudly announce a peace accord (the details of which are still awaited), if you can ally with the PDP whose leader Mehbooba Mufti believes not just that Afzal Guru should not have been executed, but has, as part of her father's "healing touch", often visited the families of dead militants because she does not think their children should be punished - if you can take these decisions and never have your patriotism questioned, do you not think it's a crazy over-reaction of the government to arrest a young man for slogans that it now turns out weren't even his own? Is battling young students - first at the Pune Film Institute, then in Hyderabad, and now at JNU - really the war you want to lead your troops into?
Do you agree that "cooking beef" and "worshipping demons" should be part of a police report to explain the "anti-nationalism" of young men, doubly ironic because the police reports to a Minister who is from the beef-eating state of Arunachal Pradesh? Did your heart not break, just a little bit, when you saw Kanhaiya Kumar being dragged and pulled, his eyes worn by physical fear? And what was your thought when you opened the morning newspapers to see a legislator of your party pounce on an opposition activist who lay flat on the road with hands folded in fright, an image that made national and international headlines for both the asymmetry and abuse of power it conveyed?
We do not know the answer to any of these questions because you have just not spoken. You have become curiously Manmohan-esque in your silences after mocking your predecessor for them. With one crucial difference - he hardly ever spoke on anything, whereas you are voluble on a host of issues, except the festering crises that are often self-creations of the government. With respect, Mr. Prime Minister, given that you are a masterful orator and won the 2014 election at least partly on the back of effective communication, these silences are bewildering.
When you do break them, it's almost always far too late to contain the damage. Think Dadri. More recently, think how a young man called Rohith Vemula was driven to suicide in Hyderabad. By the time you did express your grief, party spokespersons had defiled the debate with conspiracy theories about whether he was a Dalit or not. Then, like now, they had forced their construct of nationalism onto the debate with whispers about how slogans were raised by Vemula against the execution of Yakub Memon.
Modiji, naturally, none of us like a slogan that calls for India's ruin.
But thought cannot be policed, and nationalism cannot be regimented; it's for every Indian to define it for herself. I still get goose-bumps every single time I hear our anthem, I leap to my feet to stand and sing it out loud in my foghorn voice. But I would never support punishing or intimidating those who sit through it in a movie hall, as we saw happen in Maharashtra recently.
We are all getting on in age, but let's for a moment think back to our years in university. Being young and being rebellious is all about non-conformism and anti-establishmentarianism, It's about questioning everything - marriage, love, sexuality, caste, religion - and yes, for some, even the Nation-State. As long as this sloganeering is not accompanied by an incitement to violence, surely we need not use the sledgehammer of sedition against young people.
You wouldn't need me to remind you of the famous case Balwant Singh Vs State of Punjab - the Supreme Court overturned the charge of sedition and acquitted those who had shouted, "Khalistan Zindabad, Raj Karega Khalsa" a few hours after Indira Gandhi's assassination. If the highest court of the land can show that maturity in a much more volatile and sensitive case than the JNU controversy, why can't the government? Do we even need a sedition law that was given to us by the British in the 1860s? (Britain incidentally scrapped it in 2010.)
Whatever the BJP calculations were on converting the JNU crackdown into political advantage have clearly dissipated. Given legal precedence, Kanhaiya Kumar is sooner or later likely to be acquitted by a higher court, and will walk out a hero. Given the writing on the wall, wouldn't you, Mr. Prime Minister, think it's wiser, kinder and yes, politically smarter - apart from it also being the only correct thing to do - to drop the charges against him, order the police and the Home Ministry to concede its mistake and apologize, drop the criminal charges against the other students, and hand back the case to the JNU administration to handle it as a disciplinary issue from here on?
Gurudev Tagore, who gave us our stirring national anthem, also wrote, "Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter; my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live".
Modi ji, India belongs to its young. The tricolor is in their hands. And so is our future.

the problem with hypocrisy is that it makes people guilty over a period of time - those who are practising it. What you have written is not entirely correct. Media is no saint. They are also like political parties and you are also party to it. In all these events..perception is the biggest player and perception is against you otherwise you wouldn't have written a letter like this. <br/>
JNU is known to all this for decades. I personally have seen this in 2000 when i was there. Kanhai is no exception. A section of media is trying to make him a hero but eventually truth will come out. LEt courts decide his fate, why you guys are getting so emotional... LEt the dirt settle on its own.<br/>
And you guys keep on reporting unbiased....

Will appreciate if you can do some research &amp; pen an article on origin of 2002 Gujrat riots.    Also I never saw you writing a open letter to MMS during his 10 years of corrupt rule.

A very good emotional article but lacking intelligence. Did your Afzal Guru/Yakub think of the innocent public who were killed? Why this one sided emotional story? India is a democracy which can tolerate hoisting of the flag of Pakistan but is not a stupid country if they deface Indian flag and hoist Pakistani flag.Modi is not ultimate. We have president, the honorable courts and the chief election commissioner to preserve Democracy but your emotional article can only strengthen anti-national elements.Did the students who uttered pro-Afzal slogan read the judgement from the court and think?You cannot blame a surgeon(the court) who does his job fairly to save the public.

                            Like all those who are supporting/ justifying what happened in JNU, you too have highlighted the happenings in Patiala Court. This is not the first instance of Goondagiri in court by lawyers. I really wish you had written open letter at that time too. One wrong cannot justify another one. Such arguments are childish. Brandishing image as anti national is even more childish. Reporting should be without any bias. The channel you have mentioned in your article is vociferous about everything, in favor of the Government or against it, as against your stand and some of the so called media fraternity who are perpetually against right wing. There was sloganeering in JNU. Whether Kanhaiya Kumar was involved or not will be decided by the court. Our courts are strong enough to comment sternly against the incumbent government too. So leave that job to the courts. But please don't try to put the happenings in JNU under the carpet on the pretex that lawyers have behaved badly and voice was doctored. It is time media starts behaving impartially. I know that BJP may loose the next election when the messiahs of the downtrodden and Muslims will join hands just to ensure that they can continue to remain in power. Add to that the foolish behavior of the Government functionaries and the future is clear. But do think where such posturing and reporting will lead our country. Just r fans are wishing that the PM reads your article, I wish you too read all the comments and ponder over them instead of continuing to be self righteous.

                            The letter is Rant which tries to show the prime minister in poor light. At a time when all of us should be speaking in one voice for this concerns the unity and integrity of the country we find these fissiparous voices rising amongst us. The author never touches the other contentious issues, she remains silent on them, but finds her voice to lament on the other issues. Perhaps as journalist she has forgotten that  neutrality is the core ethical value which cannot be compromised, but I guess that had been lost several decades ago, in the enthusiasm to please the congress. We have all known the proximity of the channel and the author to congress party for several decades, and the article once again clearly shows those leanings.Not surprised by this piece at all. Never did she write to the ex prime minster when the country was being plundered by his cronies, when soldiers were being butchered on the LOC, or when prime ministers files were being sent out of the office  and the list is as long as laundry list. Criticising your own colleagues out sheer malice is the worse one can do to his fraternity, and a person who throws vitriol at her own colleagues and hates them, one can imagine how much integrity she has to her nation.

U r absolutely right in saying the videos of Kanhiya been doctored to show him in a bad light. But I am still trying to comprehend ur line 'the people who do not stand for the national anthem should be spared'. And interestingly u cited "age" for being unable to stand. R u listening to urselves?? U really think people would mind if someone's disability doesn't allow them to stand?? And the recent incident in Maharashtra was due to the disability???? Stop embarrassing urselves. I agree with u about apologizing to Kanhiya in case of his acquittal (which is very likely) and also, the case should be heard at a quick pace to make sure his studies (assuming he cares) r not impacted. The ones who shouted anti-India slogans MUST be tried and so the goons in black coats who attached Kanhiya. But u please stop being over sympathetic with those who sympathize with people like Afzal and Maqbool. Ty.

                            Please don't try to create sympathy for anti nationals. What's happening in JNU was well known but no action was taken by your dear Congress government. These people were all backed by your favorite Left.<br/><br/>
Its not a mere coincidence that same day Raveesh Kumar and Barkha, both of NDTV are releasing near about same kind of articles against Modi and Arnab. What right you have to talk about Arnab. If he is against anti national activities of JNU students, he wad equally vocal against violence in court, unlike you who have only focused on Court and Government action against anti nationals. You can only criticize Modi. Its your personal agenda to spread and create anti Modi mood in the country.<br/><br/>
But you and people like you will not succeed. Indians are not fool Barkha.<br/>

                            Barkha great effort to put heartfelt request to PM. I wish he will read it and do the needful. If he remains mute for this issue then it will be shame on nation for electing such PM.

                            Ok Barkha fine. In many places you are correct. That government could have handled this issue much better way &amp; the hooliganism is never allowed. They should be punished. Now question for you.. take it...<br/><br/>
1) You are playing Victim now. what you did to Modi for years. Congress used all power &amp; this guy has come clean. Will you, Nidhi, Rajdeep, Sagarika, (all leading news paper journalists) would write a similar letter &amp; ask for apology.<br/><br/>
2) Did you see the way debates are conducted. Just see how your colleague Nidhi conduts it. There are 2 issues; (a) Anti India slogan &amp; (b) hooliganism. Nidhi spends 1 min for point (a) &amp; wants to spend 59 mmins for point (b). Do you agree. Sambit gives her tough time. Barkha People will ask now; monopoly on intellects are over.<br/><br/>
3) You bring people like Mridula (professor) as neutral panelist. Do you really think so. <br/><br/>
4) you have a big heart. Show me one video, where Nidhi, Rajdeep, Sagarika challenged desperately to Kashimiri leaders for the genocide. You talk about Riot. I hope you know what is genocide.<br/><br/>
5) You ask does the government have only this issue. We all know what Modi government is doing. We are aware of make in India initiative. But you do not want to have many debates on that. should people not ask question.<br/><br/>
6) You are not showing what's going on on in Kerala, Bengal. Do you think people do not know. What are those whole bunch of Award wapsi gang doing now. Why are they hiding. Do you think people should still not ask question. Demography is changing &amp; Malda is just one of the incident. No award Wapsi for Malda.<br/><br/>
I can keep on going. One thing I want to tell you; today's youth want job, better life, want to see India becoming global super power. they have many sources to get info. If you, Nidhi, Rajdeep &amp; sagarika e.t.c. think, we see world through you; may be you are leaving in 2002. Jai hind.

                            dear barkha<br/><br/>
Did u write the open letters to PM 's who were there during the bofors ghotala, the 2G scam, the coal scam, the chara ghotala, the irrigation scam, the urea scam, the adarsh scam and many more. being a middle class person what i think is why i have to shell this much tax and i think of all those scams. its better today i dont have to worry about the scams, so why are u so always eager to mailgn this govt. Pls put some positive energy in your writting so that people like me live out of hope and not of hopelessness. I urge you to write open letters to widows of soliders saying i am more worried for those JNU students than the people whom they supported are the reason for you being widows. And pls do write open letters.

If it is proved that the tape on which Government has moved against students is fake ( some reports in media indicate that ) then it is really a matter of great concern for every citizen of this country and more the silence of our PM.

                            You are right before you started to write! It will never be read by the person whom it is addressed nor it is going to make any difference to him if he has the capacity to comprehend the contents or the spirit of this message. That is why I stopped writing after I finished writing my doctoral thesis. But to expect someone like "Modiji" to change or at the least to be influenced by another person's thoughts or writings is ironic and too far-fetched given his individual persona and his own history. Sorry!

                            Well reasoned Barkha!<br/><br/>
Modi is no doubt on a mission to bring economic development in India. He has carried out very good global campaign to drive investment in India. It was very good to see many investors excited about India when Modi came to Hannover conference (Germany) and similarly, I suppose so in many other countries. We have also seen him preaching about saving the planet (COP21) and the need for humanity and tolerance (House of Commons). What surprises me is that despite having such a global outlook why can't the ruling government rise above sectarian politics. India is on a rise to become one of the World's super power. Along the transformation process we will certainly encounter differing opinions on how we should move forward as a Nation. The only civilize way to address such differing viewpoints is through  dialogue and reasoning and not through intimidation and mob justice. What has happened in JNU has very important precedence for how we move forward and the Nation is debating on it. <br/><br/>
I am sure as head of a country Modiji must be very busy. BUT if he can tweet "happy birthdays" he surely can send a message on how our Nation should move forward, unless of course he endorses what is going on.

                            Dear Bharkha Aunty,<br/><br/>
Stop thinking with your heart, please apply your mind. Why is it that you did not have a similar letter written when Baba Ramdev was not allowed to enter the university or Mr.ashok Singhal not allowed or when the Israeli delegate  not allowed to address students??? Why were you not covering the same?<br/><br/>
In democracy if everybody has a right to speak then the other person should also be allowed to share his point of view. Please agree with my point of view if you want us to share your point of view.<br/><br/>
Even Mr.Narendra Modi faced protest from students before the Lok Sabha elections. Have you forgotten Aunty. Yon did not feel the need to cover that and explain it to the students? Why Barkha aunty? Why?<br/><br/>
If you do not respond, then please stop writing letters to the PM. Next time you may want to write to me before you write to the PM.
