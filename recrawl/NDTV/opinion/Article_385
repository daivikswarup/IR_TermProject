Headline::::Obama Parting Speech Won't do Modi Political Harm



DateTime::::2015-01-30T03:12:00+05:30



(The writer is a political columnist, a lapsed historian and a committed conservative.)
	President Barack Obama's Town Hall speech has, quite predictably, triggered a minor storm. The government side has, not unnaturally, brushed aside suggestions that the eloquent sermon that also touched upon themes such as religious and minority rights was a veiled indictment of the Narendra Modi government. However, both the media and Modi's other critics have gloated over this apparent sting in the tail at the fag end of an otherwise successful visit. They have used Obama's invocation of Article 25 to add to the existing turbulence over religious conversions. Regardless of how the visit of the American president was perceived in the larger public, they have cited the subtext of the Town Hall speech to try and puncture the Modi momentum.
	The argument proffered by some over-enthusiastic members of the Modi ministry that Obama was speaking in broad generalities and peppering the media with tasty - but essentially banal-sound bites isn't entirely persuasive. American politicians invariably tend to be salesmen for an "American dream", which they combine with gratuitous advice to peoples that are not driven by the same national vision. The belief that Western civilization and its way of life are both materially and ethically superior has underpinned US diplomacy since World War II, even when it has involved shoddy compromises with disreputable regimes. President Ronald Reagan-an accomplished communicator, on par with President Bill Clinton and Obama - made effective use of the "truth, justice and the American way" spiel to demolish the "Evil Empire" that was the Soviet Union.
	Over time, it has also incorporated facets of the condescension that was a feature of British imperial diplomacy, at least until the Suez debacle of 1956 drove home the end of Empire. A possible reason why this approach has persisted is due to the undeniable fact that national elites, particularly in the erstwhile colonized parts of the globe, have actually internalized the belief in the superiority of the "American way". It is only very recently that this perception has been challenged by first, an ever-rising China, and subsequently, Islamism - neither of which are benign influences.
	Given this backdrop, it would be misleading to believe that Obama's references to harmony, co-existence and cultural pluralism were entirely innocent and divorced from the specific. The reference to Article 25 of India's Constitution conferring untrammelled rights to all religious communities (apart, interestingly, from Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) to profess, practice and propagate their faith wasn't innocent. In the wake of the ghar wapsi initiative by a section of Hindu activists, there has been a call by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and even the Bharatiya Janata Party to effect a legal ban on all conversions - a move that would necessitate a modification of the existing Article 25. The initiative has been resolutely opposed by the Christian clergy, not least because it feels that evangelism is central to its larger religious mission. The foremost foreign funding for the evangelists comes from the United States, which has witnessed the rise of political Christianity. Although the Christian Coalition isn't well disposed towards the Obama administration, its priorities are nevertheless an important input in the making of American foreign policy. With Republicans dominating Capitol Hill, the White House was no doubt mindful of the need to accommodate some of these Christian concerns, even by way of a token utterance.
	Thanks to the manner in which Modi's detractors have interpreted the Town Hall utterances, and the debate they have generated, Obama can at least draw satisfaction that one of his domestic compulsions has been met.
	Such an argument isn't either fanciful or needlessly paranoic. The extent to which security concerns and business interests have moulded US foreign policy has been richly documented.
	Less appreciated is the extent to which Christian lobbies- those institutions that send money to India as opposed to those who see India as a zone of potential profit- provide a non-secular input to the workings of the State Department. During the termof the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government, for example, the US embassy in Delhi was quite active in mobilizing domestic opposition to the sporadic attacks on improvised churches in the Dangs district of Gujarat. Domestic opponents of the BJP (and Modi in particular) have received unending encouragement and patronage from institutions such as the official US commission on international religious freedom.
	In its 2014 annual report, USCIRF clubbed India with Afghanistan, Cuba, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia and Turkey as a mid-level threat to religious freedom. It listed three issues that the US government should keep in mind while deepening its strategic relationship with India.
	First, it advised the administration to "integrate concern for religious freedom into bilateral contacts with India". Secondly, it wanted steps to "increase the US embassy's attention to issues of religious freedom and related human rights" concerns. Finally, and in more specific terms, it "urge(d) the Central Indian government to press states that have adopted anti-conversion laws to repeal or amend them to conform with internationally recognized human rights standards".
	President Obama's brief mention of religious tolerance last Tuesday could well be read in this context. Obviously, the demand for anti-conversion laws to prevent mass-scale "harvesting" of souls has ruffled a few feathers in the world of political Christianity. However, these sectarian concerns that stem from the US's domestic compulsions must be kept in perspective. India may be perversely equated with Afghanistan in the USCIRF's index of religious freedom, but this is offset by the acknowledgement of India's economic potential and its importance in the emerging Great Game in Asia centred on an assertive China. Obama didn't come to India because he wanted to wag a finger at Modi and lecture the country on how to conduct itself. As far as his priorities went, the USCIRF agenda was just a footnote. No wonder the sermon was left till the very end of his visit and delivered at a non-official function. More to the point it was couched in the language of economic self-interest and made to appear as a universal truism: that growth and prosperity need a climate of social harmony.
	It is understandable that both the mainstream and social media have picked on these contentious sentences to either berate Modi or denounce the US for being oh-so patronizing. By its very nature, the media in their entirety love acrimony and polemical exchanges. The complicated negations over the civil nuclear partnership was too abstruse for studio brawls; Michelle Obama kept a low profile and didn't provide the much anticipated glamour quotient; and the sheer stodginess of the president's official banquet at an outhouse in the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex couldn't really be pinned on Modi. So, in the end, the largely successful Obama visit boiled down to two contrived brawls: the first over the gratuitous references to India's duty at the Siri Fort auditorium and, finally, over Modi's monogrammed pin stripes. The first allowed the disoriented army of Modi-sceptics to feel that America still cares. The second permitted the pillars of entitlement a snigger or two at the expense of a man they despise but whose popularity remains undiminished.
	Obama's Republic Day visit was the first occasion that Modi's skills in public diplomacy were put to the test-earlier visits by the China's premier and Russia's president didn't generate the same measure of popular interest. In their minds, Indians were comparing Modi with representatives of the Gandhi family who had excelled in the meeting the- foreigner department. The 'chaiwala' didn't let the side down. He did well out of the visit and, ironically, the little storm over Obama's parting shot won't do him any harm politically.

WE NEED NOT WORRY IF THE CONVERSIONS ARE  NOT FORCIBLE OR BY MEANS OF LURING THE GULLIBLE...<br/><br/>
WE SEE THE CHRISTIAN PASTORAL LETTER ASKING TO STOP RE.CONVERSIONS... WILL THEY BE BOLD ENOUGH TO GIVE A COMMITMENT TO STOP CONVERSIIONS...<br/><br/>
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD THINKS THAT THEY CAN PASS SERMONS ON INDIA BECAUSE WE DO NOT RESPECT OUR OWN HERITAGE AND CULTURE.... IT IS TRUE WHEN MR. SWWAMY SAYS THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE MUSLIMS HERE WERE HINDUS.... WHAT IS THE SHAME IN IT FOR THEM TO ACCEPT IT... CAN THEY DENY IT...<br/><br/>

                            You are bashing America for its foreign policy &amp; business interest since world war 2 &amp; now that are promoting their interest on same lines, you telling the visit to be successful not worrying about America's same business &amp; foreign policy interests. You have forgotten a decade where Modi &amp; his brethren talked about selling the sovereignty of India at every chance they got and blocked Parliament at every occasion is now not at all worry about protecting the sovereignty. You are one side of the same coin whose other side is none other than Mani, probably writing another article on bashing Modi for each &amp; everything. You guys are sick.

                            This nut doesn't even bothered to understand the term "foreign fund from US to spread evangelism". FYI, the US protestend evangelists are minorities are nothing but just an another version of groups such as Islam, Jews etc... which are a mere minorities in India. The actual evangelical activities are carrying out by Catholic Church and for them neither the so called US/ UK/German (all different groups,and have totally different way of life) protestend groups fund money nor the Catholic Church will accept money. You need to know more about Catholic Church and their concerns to understand this. Also note that, it is the reverse flow that happens from Indian Catholic Church's to Vatican for various mission activities. Trust clear and do research prior penning nonsenses.

                            Obama's speaking about "religious freedom" was ONLY a "Caveat", for any possible failure and /or deviation from commitment made. Easy to say, "Oh! India is splintered NOT being able to progress etc".   Americans, Obama is NO exception,are "Ruthless business people". Hope Obama, has NOT underestimated Modi &amp; Gujus. Gujus are equally, if NOT more business like than Americans, Modi is NO exception. Incidentally, Let Obama take a "Christ on a Cross" openly to Saudi Kingdom and as well protect black/ Asian  minorities in USA, before preaching us.

                            Mr. Obama may have lectured on the secularism because of the American business in India and if secular instability prevails FDI will hamper. Also MODI may have requested OBAMA to give such hints on secularism during his lecture in Town Hall. But it is true that,time has come to think over one law for every citizen irrespective of Religion.

                            I'm an Indian American and frankly speaking don't give too much importance to OBAMA's aristocratic lecturing. India has a peculiar situation and politics on ground and it is for Indian public to choose what kind of secularism, religious freedom is appropriate for them. Democracy there re-calibrate and readjust that from time to time. IN recent election, Indian people chose to go with Modi despite the visa denial and secular debate.  India led the way and then everybody including USA had to fall in line. So that's that. <br/><br/>
Now, I'm appalled by the way Modi was falling flat,bending backward, going overboard to welcome Obama. After all bear hugs, Chicken, Biryani, President palace chaipani, bhojan, then Prime Minister's residence chai pani, BHojan several times, Chief Ministers, their wives parking in Delhi for few days just to Take Obamaji and his beloved wives Darshan( They have never seen anything like this before), even one MP offering shawl to Obamaji as if he is going to give him US visa. I'm glad to see the rebuke from OBAMA...our politicians deserve this for misusing poor people's money and their emotional support. If Memory is not short, the same politicians will do this again when we have New US President in 2 yrs.

                            Actually it endorses Modi's view. It is essentially aimed at extremists and radicals like ISIS! Many, including media, seem to have developed a mind-set against Modi and anywhere the name Hindu crops up. A Hindu has a choice to worship 8.9 million forms of god in Dwaita and God within oneself in Advaitya philosophies. Sri Rama Krisna and his disciple Swami Vivekananda who is Modi's ideal, saw the same God in Shakti,Christ as well as in Prophet Mohammed!

The right wing Christian coalition and him are bitter enemies, they form no part of his supporter base - there is absolutely no reason why he would have said it for that purpose. Those people have no influence on his administration of foreign policy at all.
