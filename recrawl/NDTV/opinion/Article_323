Headline::::Dear PK, Notes From a TV Reporter



DateTime::::2014-12-24T15:03:00+05:30



(Sunetra Choudhury is Associate Editor, National Affairs, NDTV 24x7)As a news reporter,  I went to see PK, our desi version of ET with a heavy message of harmony in diversity, to figure out what the fuss was all about. I wanted to see which hashtag I felt closer to- the one that supported PK or the angry one that was spewing in the mouth about it. But in the trail of all the Gods and godmen, I got distracted.  I started making notes about how PK had portrayed the other, much-vilified acronym -  TV. I figured Aamir Khan was a perfectionist,  so from one professional to another, he might appreciate a real reporter's take on what Anushka projected so prettily. 1. I start right from the beginning when Anushka's character, Jaggu, meets her love interest. When she finds out the boy is from Pakistan, her face falls.Reality: No TV reporter would ever be disappointed about meeting a Pakistani, that too a looker like Sushant Singh. To us, all Pakistanis are a potentially good story so we're always thrilled to meet them all.2. Anushka plays a modern career woman who's pursuing media studies in Belgium. But when her family is shocked by her Pakistani boyfriend, she challenges it by asking him to marry her immediately.Reality: There's no good journalism school in Belgium. Even if there was, which sassy TV reporter will jump into marriage during j-school just to prove some Godman wrong? Not realistic.3. Anushka's boss, played by Boman Irani, acts like a real TV anchor when he wears track pants under his formal jacket. Yes, many of us do that. But then he wants Anushka to do a story about a depressed dog and a debate on it.Reality: Indian TV takes itself very, very seriously. We may do debates about Godmen but we never do debates about animals, even though sometimes, we probably should.4.  PK manages to get into police lock-up by peeing publicly and making sure the police catch him.Reality: I have been a reporter in this city for 15 years and more, and I have seen nobody get arrested for public urination. You can piss into police patrol vans, and you may get a lathi or two for it, but you won't go to jail for it.5. Anushka uses a dictaphone for interviewing PK.Reality: We never use that. Never used it as a print reporter either. We now have apps to record, but even then, unless it is a sit-down interview of a politician who is likely to go back on his word, we don't use tapes. Especially not those old fashioned tape recorders seen in the film.6. PK sees couples making out in cars all over the countryside. He dubs them 'dancing cars' or some such.Reality: We have make-out areas in gardens, make out areas in Bombay's bandstands. But 'dancing cars' are too much of a Hollywood adoption, not in the Indian landscape in the bright sunlight.7. Anushka hugs her editor.Reality: The Indian newsroom is a manic place and while lot of office romances and love-hate exchanges are common, we don't hug our boss when he okays our story idea (note from editors - we wish you would.  Sort of).  8. Anushka carries her subject, PK, home with her.Reality: When she bribes for her story, I bought it. When she chases her story for days, even though we have shorter, more urgent deadlines, I still accepted it. But really, no right-thinking, safety-conscious Delhi reporter will bring some strange man home- even if he looks good naked like Aamir Khan does.9. And finally, did you see Anuskha's house presumably in Nizamuddin East overlooking the Humayun's tomb? Reality: Most TV reporters' single pad doesn't look like that. And neither do those interiors.What the film gets right of course is that we would all love to have someone take on a Godman like Aamir's character does with Tapaswi. And, hell yeah, what a great TRP maker it would be! And just like Boman Irani relates how he got trishulled by unhappy Godman's followers, we too can't forget how Baba Rampal fuelled violence that landed many NDTV crew members in hospital recently. So do go, enjoy the movie, but remember, TV's a bit different than how Raj Kumar Hirani and Aamir Khan see it.

                            OK! so as a very informed journalist you are trying to find the proximity of the movie's characters to the real life around us and the protagonist is an alien.

                            The movie does subtly call for introspect. The movie has been done wonderfully having referred to godmen, babajis and gurujis as business men and managers, and the mass gatherings that are drawn to such fake sadhus. I am sure all of the viewers were able to relate to Jaggu's family, reverently following guruji's auspicious allotted times for all sorts of household chores and work. All 'wrong number' bhakths deprived of common sense will now start to comment on how it has failed to exposed their falsehood.

You could have covered also about the story slightly tilted towards negative aspects of Hinduism and not that much about other religions...

                            Dear TV Reporters in India,<br/>
Here are few suggestions:<br/>
Movies are make belief please don't take it literarily. Let creativity flow and entertain the public.<br/>
Nick-picking scenes which are not central to the story theme shows you are very bad at story writing and you would be very bad at print Journalism.<br/>
Reacting(face falls) to a Pakistanis is what the general mood of the public lately. Living in US&amp; Europe, you would come to know they have a very bad reputation here! You should read international articles and keep up.<br/>
Indian reporters are the WORST DRESSED in the whole wide world. REALLY! Need lots of improvement. Living in US make us feel Indian reporters neither maintain their bodies or well dressed or camera friendly nor presentable(make up).<br/>
Having a good rapport with your Boss and giving harmless hugging is good. But if your boss is a duss bag it is a NO NO!<br/>
Rest take it easy and enjoy life. You should have enjoyed the movie instead of taking notes!(find ways to improve your memory and finish writing after the movie or an event)

                            For a moment, consider this movie PK ridiculing the Mullahs instead of the Godmans. What would have been the reaction of the minority religion and the SICULAR brigade ?? No doubt, Hirani &amp; Aamir have also criticized the other religions slightly to show that they have the same views towards all religions, but it is very clear that their main target was the HINDU religion.I am an die-hard Aamir fan and was so eager to watch the movie, but was not really amused watching the movie. I expected a better product from Hirani since he has worked for 5 years on this movie.

                            Dear Sunetra Choudhury, it seems like you really need a lengthy course of journalism. Let me point out a few "ignorant remarks" of yours.<br/><br/>
1. Anushka's character Jaggu has been brought up in a family who r extremely religious. If you think she will fall in love with a hot Pakistani as soon as she sees him . There are lot of things that needs to be considered. Considering the bad relationship we have between India and Pakistan, plus the religious issue - u r bound to think 100 times before jumping into a relationship with Pakistan. I lived in Europe too for many years. I had quite a few Pakistani friends. They were extremely nice people and hot too, but like I said, I was hesitant enough to ever consider them to be my love interest. <br/><br/>
2. If you have really seen the movie, then you would understand that Jaggu didn't bring PK into her home as soon as she met him. She met him few times before ( never naked FYI. Please watch the movie again). She didn't believe his story for  along time unless PK actually proved his mind reading power ( Giving money to the elderly Sardar knowing he was lying about his wife being in hospital etc.) She was looking for a story which would've been extra ordinary and she found PK. <br/><br/>
3. "Dancicng car" hollywood concept only ?? U really need to visit the countryside of India properly. <br/><br/>
4. For public urination, there are actually some places where u can be thrown in jail for that. Pune is one of them. The difference is when ppl actually do, they try not to pee infront of a police officer to avoid any jail time. FYI, the character in PK was a repeat offender. I really don't see why r u so surprised on this.<br/><br/>
Lastly I really have to question now the journalism capability of NDTV, if they r willing to hire a reporter like u who just write things without basic investigation or without knowing the difference between reality and artistic freedom of a movie. As a well wisher I would really recommend that you go through another course of journalism very soon.

                            The character PK( Played by a muslim man Aamir khan) says jo darr gya wo mandir gya. Hmmm. Wat abt church &amp; mosque &amp; other places? Y did u went to haj. When u urself can't accept the fact then how come u agree upon doing the scene Mr.Khan? U'r certainly an alien to Hinduism &amp; Hindu believes. Raju Hirani is portraying all GyanBaji in his all movies. But where is d reality? Munnabhai doesn't exist in any college. They will be thrown out immediately. 3 Idiots was good but is it really possible? No way. And now PK. Wat next Mr.Hirani? Taking on PM &amp; President of India. Overhyped Movie &amp; copycat of OMG!!!

                            Sunetra..While I appreciate you as a journo, this was really not called for. Movie is a work of fiction..so why justify/ complain? Do we have aliens in the real world? Do our baba's use remote controls?  If movie was a total reflection of reality, it would be boring, uninspiring and not someone would spend money to watch in theatres. We already see reality all around us and don't need a movie to reinforce the same. Its a medium of propagating an issue with some masala..and the film succeeds in that completely. I also do not agree to few points you mentioned in reality..People do hug their bosses (may be you don't), Dictaphone is still used for recording, Anushka carrying PK at home is purely a personal choice and depicts nothing on a reporters conduct, Reporters can have a fancy studio facing Humayun's tomb..what is it was owned/ gifted by parents?, There are worse debates on Indian TV than the dog debate as portrayed..u need to watch Hindi TV  news channels, Lastly, Belgium has Communication and Journalism colleges and its also offered as a subject in Universties in Belguim...so your article is not well researched. So, don't take it personally,  enjoy the movie. You are belittling your profession by getting defensive here..Cheers

                            HI Sunetra, It seems we as Indians are increasingly getting more intolerant. Its a movie at the end of the day, people take certain liberties and no one is going to assume TV to be exactly the way they have been shown to be. However, there is a larger section of News media which are exactly like the one shown in the movie. Who telecast stories for hours on how an UFO abducted a cow from a village. I mean seriously! I dont think you have watched such crap often termed as "Breaking news"by many. Please do tune into channels like India TV for further insight. We are aware citizens, and we know that there are stereotypes that exists like gay men being portrayed feminine, cops being portrayed corrupt, this doesn't mean all such men are same. So please, there no reason to take such things so seriously and please try and be more witty and learn to take humor well. Its a skill to be able to laugh in yourself. All the best

                            Sunetra - I have seen you as a reporter on the election bus several years back... Now you have grown up and feel the need to protect your turf...<br/><br/>
My 2 cents to you...<br/><br/>
1. Enjoy a movie as a movie... The big mistake we do is start comparing it with real life. You now complain about wrong depcition of a TV/news/Media world and Someone else would complain about religion  and Someone else would complain about a Doctor or Lawyer... Finally the movie would be in trouble !.. <br/><br/>
2. From, where we stand media is now after TRP... ocassinally we see value, but it has just become too much noise... Something you want to write about and try to improve.<br/><br/>

                            On a funny note, I do agree with the reporter about how the subject was treated by RKH and AK in PK. I am not too sure what was the theme of the movie..Was it a pseudo tragi-comedy trying to take on a complex and diverse Indian politico-religious landscape? Or was it just a nut-job of a movie?<br/><br/>
Well whatever.. The movie left a bitter taste in my mouth considering the expectations we have from any AK starrer! I mean was this the same guy who worked on movies like TZP?

                            OMG, this article was written by an NDTV journalist. Here is my 10 points for you: <br/>
1..... Your article is very immature. <br/>
2..... Your article has a sense of show-off. You want to show ur lifestyle. <br/>
3..... 3 Hrs of Movie PK actually works more for society than what all the journalists in all channels altogether can do in one full year.  <br/>
4..... Hugging a boss ? Do you think thats something u should even mention in an international article read by people all over the world ? <br/>
5..... Do you think people watching this movie in villages know what an Android APP is all about ? This movie has a message and its important sometimes to go back to old stuff. <br/>
6..... Peeing in public and going to lockup, whats the issue. People would know that in Delhi if you pee in public you can end up in Jail. Good Message in movie. I am sure some people will think before peeing in public. <br/>
7..... Debates about a dog. Ask your fellow reporter friends. Who has made that image, every evening you will have some show showing some non sense equally like what is shown in the movie. <br/>
8..... Nice house issue, if a reporter has been shown a nice house, whats the problem with that. It was important in my opinion to have shot some scenes in open with stars coz AAmir is an Alien. <br/>
9..... Marrying next day to challenge the godman, it was something which in my personal opinion was shown to make the storyline. Didnt you see how emotinal sentimental it became when the movie ended ? Also it something which is good for India Pakistan relationships. <br/>
10.....REALITY - This article should be removed or should have never published.

                            Cinema is licensed for dramatization. don't zoom into mistakes which otherwise won't be seen if you sit back and watch the movie just to have a good time! I think the writer is a bit too cynical.

                            Interesting to read... But it feels as though these are mainly your personal opinions and thoughts - Which is fair..You're allowed to them lol. Maybe her face didn't fall at the news that he's Pakistani but that he's a Muslim. A lot of Indian families are still conservative and have strong opinions of inter-religion marriage. Her reason to ask him to marry her straightaway could be as a result of insecurity. Modern, career women are also allowed to feel insecure and voice it. As for a journalism school in Belgium... If there's no good journalism school, where do the local people study journalism? Are you saying their news are not good enough because their schools are not good...? I can't comment much on how the bosses are there and the editors so I won't say much. Also on urination laws. But if dancing cars was too much of a Hollywood concept, we do have movies these days that use a lot of Hollywood concepts don't we? Why pick on that particular aspect of it. Also with regards to her house... Maybe she worked hard and saved up for it :) <br/>
So hope you don't take the movie too seriously. I am a scientist. When they show science in movies like Krrish 3 I don't complain- it's a movie. It's about the bigger picture. ;)

                            well it was her observation and comment on how tv journalism is portrayed in the movie..she is pointing out the loopholes which is correct as she is journalist..so stop criticising her.. If aamir khan portrays himself very perfect such mistakes wont have appeared and same expected from raju as he is one of the good directors of bollywood. Way it was job to point out the mistakes and she did and it's her work.. wonder why people are so upset as they do their job and they want it to be perfect. So guys read what she wrote for dont read what u want to react for.

                            I think the writer is forgetting that this is a movie not a documentary and the way she is defending her filed of work as if its a biopic on her life. If you ask a god-man he will point similar in accuracies and so will a defense expert about a spaceship landing without their knowledge. It's a movie full of sarcasm/humor and everyone is entitled to have their opinion till the time it is not forced on anyone. it's piece of art and good or bad should be decided by the audience and not a certain section of society. FREEDOM OF SPEECH should be respected.

                            The first lesson any Journalist should learn is to be resilient. I suppose this person lacks it totally.  Many good movies made with good intent did not make it to mass population because they lacked entertainment. RKH might have taken some liberties, but it is for the good of the larger message to reach maximum people. One needs maturity to understand the perspectives. I guess it is too much to ask for from this author, much beyond her territory.

Films, I thought, were meant to be a mix of unreal and real. Not this movie alone, there are I would thousands and thousands of films that show professions and many other things incorrectly or not the real way...but that doesn't deserve an article. Common!

                            Movies are meant for entertainment and so much debate and the box office proves indeed it is an entertainer, as simple as that. Secondly, the main focus of the story on ''Godmen'' proves that Hindus are more tolerant and shows absolute but unintentional bias of raj Kumar Hirani and displays fear of the movie maker and that shows up in his direction overall of this movie. RKH tried to put too much into one story, including a lover from our neighbor (was it necessary ? Or does it only add to the box office ?)

                            Ohh Please... !! Your Journalism showed just now when you not only pointed these points, but also posted here!! Just go and enjoy the movie!! There are many other things to be debated and written about. And last but not the least, we know about your so called journalism.. Yesterday there was a massacre in Assam, and you did not even bother to show that because you had to show live election results sitting with few political rivals

                            Really? What made you write this article? I think we all know what reality journalism is, especially after hearing the famous Barkha Dutt audio tapes. Just enjoy the movie and appreciate the lessons one needs to learn from it...........!
