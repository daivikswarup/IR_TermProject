Headline::::Justice for India's Daughters



DateTime::::2015-03-06T21:06:00+05:30



(Sonia Singh is NDTV's Editorial Director)
	I watched 'India's Daughter' last week prepared to hate it. NDTV had been approached by independent filmmaker Leslee Udwin regarding her documentary for the BBC, part of a global initiative on Women's Day to focus attention on sexual crimes against women and how societal attitudes must change. It was a film, she said, had been made as a tribute to Nirbhaya and the thousands of protesters that came out after this ghastly crime in a spontaneous show of solidarity, scenes she said she had never seen in any other country. Leslee had asked to use our footage of the time, as did many other international news channels, and now that the BBC had agreed for it to be part of a global initiative, she requested NDTV to be the Indian broadcast partner.
	However, our final decision to carry it would depend on it meeting our standards, editorially, ethically and legally and most importantly, with the full consent of Nirbhaya's family.
	Why should we give this disgusting man any publicity were my first thoughts as I sat down to watch it? 59 minutes later, I had changed my mind.
	While my opinion of Mukesh... a monster of a human being... remained unchanged, what sickened me the most was how 'normal' he sounded. His 'defence': it was her fault... words which were echoed further into the documentary by his two lawyers, officers of the court. The difference between Mukesh and them was that he committed this heinous crime, yet their mental processes seemed exactly the same. Worse, these arguments are ones we have all heard often made by different politicians, judges, police officers regardless of gender. What shone through, however, was the sheer heroism of "India's Mother and Father", as I referred to them in my programme, Nirbhaya's parents. Asha and Badri were the true torchbearers of courage and dignity amid their deep, deep grief; their words are the ones you remember after you watch this documentary, not Mukesh and his lawyers.
	Others as well -  Nirbhaya's young tutor, the doctor who examined her, the police constable who talked of how so many people stopped to stare at the gruesome accident but no one came forward to help, Justice Leila Seth, interviewed in painstaking detail by Leslee over two years. It was their voices that lingered. Contrary to the perception the title may create, the story may be set in India but statistics shown in the documentary make it clear this is a GLOBAL problem.  
	It was absolutely essential for us however that whatever the editorial justification, Nirbhaya's parents' opinion and consent be solicited before we even considered airing it. Leslee Udwin told us the parents had seen the entire documentary and she had their written approval, but I wanted to speak to Asha, Nirbhaya's mother myself. We called her to ask and mentioned we were doing a TV programme on this documentary. Their response was instant: "We want to be part of it. We spoke to Leslee for the documentary because we didn't want the nation to forget and we want to come on your show for the same reason."
	I insisted it would be too traumatic for them to hear us discuss the rapist's mindset. "It doesn't matter to me at all, I have kept a stone on my heart," said Asha. I agreed, but insisted she should join us only in the second part when we would see what the lawyers said. "We heard them say this in court too, they want publicity but my question is why the Supreme Court hasn't even begun hearing the appeal?" asked Asha - a question for which neither I nor my panelists had any answer.
	On the panel for the show,  besides Nirbhaya's parents and Leslee Udwin were three women, coincidentally all from the BJP - Kiran Bedi, Pinki Anand, Additional Solicitor General of India and Vani Tripathi, member of the Censor Board plus Dushyant Dave of the Supreme Court Bar Association.
	The first question I asked Leslee Udwin (whom I had met for the first time just the previous day) was if she interviewed the rapist to glorify him for TRPs?
	She was outraged; perhaps that's why she revealed her own trauma on the show. In her words , "...what brought me to India was respect, admiration and being inspired by those extraordinary protesters, the ordinary men and women of India, who went out on the streets, who led the world by example because I, I myself have been raped. And I say this, it's very important that I say this, because there is no shame that should adhere to me as a result of that, the shame is the rapist's. What I've discovered on my journey, and if I hadn't met with these rapists, I wouldn't have come to the answer I've come to, the deep insight I've gained, which is that the disease is not the rapist's, the disease is the society and we, as a part of that society, must take responsibility for encouraging men to see women as of no value. You asked me why did I have to meet with the rapists - because I knew to get a meaningful answer to my question, 'why do men rape? Why does violent rape happen?' I had to go to the source. I had to hear it from them. I had to sit and ask them a hundred questions about who the significant women in their lives were, what they think of women, how a good woman should behave, what makes a bad women. I needed to understand the mentality otherwise I would have made a superficial documentary. "
	Within a few hours of our programme, the matter had escalated. MPs across parties, BJP, Congress, JDU demanded a ban, women's activists asked for it not to be shown, Twitter gave its verdict, a government ban plus court order meant NDTV would not air it on the 8th as scheduled.
	Leslee Udwin came to meet me before she left, "My lawyer has told me I may be arrested, I may never return to India again," she said.  "I'm devastated my film won't be seen in India but I'm happy about one thing."
	"What?" I asked. "Nirbhaya's father called my producer this morning, "she said, "Badriji asked her to tell me not to worry and thanked me for making the film. That's all the validation, I need."
	Will the controversy around India's Daughter focus our nation's attention once again not just on Nirbhaya and her case, but on the case of Zaheera in Lucknow, gang raped 10 years ago at 13 but still waiting for her trial to begin ? Will we look inwards and focus on how India treats all its Daughters? Will we shift our outrage over a foreign woman daring to show us unpalatable truths to the reality of what's being said? Whatever your opinion of the documentary - banal, stereotypical, patronizing - even if you hate it, if it makes us look at the reality around us, perhaps this sound and fury would have achieved something substantive for India and its citizens.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Agree with you 100% . Let us shame the govt into revoking this ban. We all must also shame the Lawyers an one Anchor on a well known channel and make them apologise publically for the nonsense being uttered by them

                            Dear Editorial Director of NDTV, <br/>
I followed the interview of Leslie Udwin with NDTV anchor Nidhi Razdan and was moved by Udwin's impassioned plea to P.M. Modi to remove the ban in India on the screening of this BBC documentary as also by her asking Indians to view this film before passing judgment. Udwin went on to say that this film was not meant to defame India but to project the mindset of rapists worldwide. She said that what had impelled her most to make this movie was the unified reaction of Indians to this assault not the rape itself.  She also said that the film gave statistics on rape in Britain, South Africa and elsewhere and that it was not an India-centred film. So I made a point of watching this film and to make sure I missed nothing also watched the advertisements before and after the documentary was shown.<br/>
Dear Editor, please note that except for the Nirbhaya case there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about rape as a global problem in this film, no statistics, no mention about Britain or South  Africa or the Turkey that Udwin mentioned in her interview. Were these statistics displayed in illisible small print? Or edited out? Or am I to conclude that Udwin was simply lying?<br/>
To be fair, the film in question did not overtly attempt to denigrate our society. It was more or less a summary of the events that took place on Dec 16 2012 combined with interviews of Nirbhaya's parents and her young tutor, the rape-gang driver and his lawyers, some police officials and members of the judiciary as well as scenes centered on the protests and the subsequent police action against the protesters.<br/>
What stood out of course were the interviews and mind-set of the rapist, but worse, the concurrent mindset of his lawyers. There can be nothing to express the disgust I felt on hearing these legal representatives echo the rapists' mentality and I'm sure every decent person feels the same. However, while Udwin's documentary did not say outright that this misogynist mentality was the standard Indian one, it certainly projected that idea. <br/>
Observe the rest of the film. A senior police officer claiming that Delhi was as safe for women as any city in the world, yet the overall ineptitude of the police in this case is not touched upon at all (It was not mentioned anywhere in the documentary that the rapists had been reported and identified for robbery barely hours before their other horrendous crime and the police had taken no action). <br/>
The protests themselves: Although Udwin claims that it was the outpouring of grief and anger from all sections of Indian society, men and women alike, and this was indeed the case, that prompted her to make this film what you basically see in the film is groups of women protesters being set upon by uniformed policemen with batons, tear gas and so on. The male protesters have mostly been carefully excluded from the footage except where the gender mix is impossible to ignore. It is almost as if only women were outraged at this crime and their menfolk were indifferent. Combined with the scandalous statements by the rapist's lawyers we have a clear subliminal message: Indian men are creeps, all of them. Where is the objectivity in such a message? And fit this in with the total absence of parallels anywhere else in the world, although rape is indeed a global disease, and you can draw your own conclusions. About the only extrapolation that was not drawn was that traditional Indian Hindu society is responsible for this degraded mindset, although even that extrapolation was amply supplied by the endorsements for rape from M.L. Sharma and A.K. Singh, the two lawyers, so-called educated persons, who from their pronouncements alone revealed their lack of education.<br/>
And while Udwin claims to explore the reasons for this misogynist mindset, there was little or no clear thought or attempt to look at its causes except for a brief foray into the living conditions of the rapists. Questions that should have been asked were: are there more cases of violence against women in the present time as compared to say 50 or 100 years ago? Why, when, where and in what conditions do rapes most take place? How do the media, cinema, internet, poverty, ill-organized family planning, crime syndicates etc. influence this phenomenon? <br/>
Although I will not condemn Udwin's film as attempting to denigrate India, I do denounce it for its amateurishness, for its lack of objectivity, for its attempt to rationalize the criminal mindset and in the process unnecessarily feeding the already-prevalent notion in many places that Indian males are somehow sex-starved animals. I do not think this film should be banned in India. Rather, let all Indians know what the western world thinks of us. At the same time let us introspect into our own selves: Violence against women is indeed a problem in India but do we really need holier-than-thou outsiders to tell us about them? There is no dearth of good movie producers in India and a documentary dealing with the issue of rape could have been made with less stigmatization than shown in this film. More than half the billion-strong population of India is male and every one of them is not a rapist nor even a potential one.

                            A ban was not necessary but I still feel that you shouldn't have given this rapist a platform to justify this horrific crime.There is one another thing that is really annoying is the role of BBC here who have the habit of breaching every rulebook when it comes to making documentaries on sensitive subjects.It would have been much better had NDTV taken up this initiative on its own in bringing up the public awareness on this subject without involving any foreign media.

                            when u ask for consent, they dont know what are u doing in the first place.. and taking india as an prototype for taking this initiative sounds little wierd since there are more rapes per head in western countries.. sure we neeed to improve but you have been used by foreign media and opinion makers and the worst part is knowingly.. there is nothing NEW revelation  in the video which we already dont know. the PM stood on the Lal quila and condemned the same mentality..when hafeez saeed private interview is considered wrong, why is an rapist commercial interview being considered right???

                            Guys Iam an NRI, My views may be in a minority. I watched the program and I agree with the government that it should be banned. My reasons may also be different to the one expressed by the government. My reasons are as follows <br/>
1. I understand there are there is one rape every 20 min. Now you multiply this by number of rapist in last few years. Add to this number of men who are on border line of comminting this crime. Now if theses large number rapist and potential men saw this documenrty they certainly would be encouraged to commit more rape. Some of the comments made by that driver and his solicitor were outrageous i.e. that women should not go out at night and wear jeans etc. One of my english friend rang me next day to say that if highly educated Indians make such comment it doesn't say much about the indian culture. <br/>
2. I do not agree that a criminal should get such a publicity. I cannot imagine Japanese government will allow an interview with the terrorist who beheaded its citizen. IRA bombers were never allowed to be interviews in British Channels in the 80s. <br/>
3. Before the decession is made to lift the ban, there should be an investigations if the driver or his family was paid for this interview. Likewise the Prison officer should be investigated. I a corrupt society I will be surprised if large amounts of money was not involved. <br/>
4. As far as the public opinion is concerned, this would not carry much weight India. For a country where people have voted for corrupt goverment for 60 odd years doest say much about public opinion. I also believe the media is driving the public opinion. <br/>
5. Lastly don't blame this government for putting a ban. These type of crime has been committed under different government for last 65 years.

                            The media attention to this documentary brought some relief to Nirbhaya's parents when the case is being given a quiet burial by our courts. NDTV, please give such relief and hope to thousands of families who are waiting for justice. Just one line on the lucknow girl is not enough.

                            NDTV's unidimensional defence of this documentary smacks of conflict of interest. Them gaining the rights, this author's spouse being in the MHA in UPA 2 etc. it is unclear how all of a sudden a hardcore thug's "opinion" is so important to be heard. The actual issues are not even the colonial woman; but the moron in MHA who gave the approval, the delay in hearing the Nirbhaya case in SC and the continuous ongoing rapes.

                            Apart from being backward in their thoughts &amp; attitude, men do not fear the law &amp; its punishment! As a result you come across all these cases of pedophiles,rape &amp; abuse !If all these convicts do not behave as per norms of society,moreover a humans , what right do they have to ask for humane treatment or for that matter anyone asking on their behalf? The only way we can stop this is by allowing public to punish such culprits! Unless they have the fear of reprisal, nothing will change!What happened in Dimapur needs to be replicated all over the country!!!

                            First we must think why men become so violent. Do they not have family, a mother, a sister, a daughter? Why do they not think what if what we are doing to a girl that same thing happened to our family women. Any human will think that only first. But if they do not think like that then we must explore their psyche. How were they brought up by the parents? How did their fathers treat their grandmom, mom and sister at home? Did they see their father, grandfather, elder brother, uncle abuse their female family members and learn to do the same at home and away? OR is is some other problem a medical problem like I read rapists have some chemicals more in their body?(No this is not the case atleast). Then what is it, it is the mindset mindset with which male children are brought up in india and Asia as a whole where men have superior status than a woman at home, in office, in public. Its ok for a husband to hit wife no one stops it in public also they say wife must be at fault, its ok for father to hit daughter even in public(recently Bangalore a father hitting daughter in street near her hostel while by stander watched), its Ok for brothers to hit sisters from childhood and to kill them in name of honor of family. And this happens not only in villages and small towns in metros, this happens not only in poor family but rich educated homes, people who are highly qualified studied in premier institutes hit their wives. So these criminals are brought up in certain way and they follow it all life. Now this man will never ever accept what he did to that innocent girl is wrong because he has been thought by parents, relatives, colleagues, friends and society that its ok to misbehave with girls. They have been taught from childhood girls who are out on sreets after 6pm and with male friends are bad. Till society and family does not instill these values how shall these men become better humans. Their family and environment are equally to be blamed as them and hence first change mentality of them first. So many Mukesh must be breeding around the world and its high time we teach them morals, teach them to treat woman as equal as human not an animal from LKG only. Look at the lawyers what use of LLB they also think like rapists only. So what is use of their LLB degree. Did it make them better humans, better citizens no? Even girls are taught to bear any physical assault by father, brother and husband, in laws and sons silently as society supports it, law makers do not accept complain. They think its ok for father, brother,husband, son etc to hit a girl no complaints are filed. So this is a deep symptom not easily cured. It will take centuries before woman have better standing in society not only in india or asia but around the world. For society to change schools must change teachers must change they must be seen respecting girl children in class and parents must treat son and daughter equal till than nothing shall change.

                            everybody is complaining about the mindset in India...but nobody is asking why the mindset is like this...from my point of view it has to do with our primary education...I think this is the place where we can try fixing the problem....we need to invest more on moral education of kids...be it about rape, be it corruption or using harmful chemicals, pesticides in crop or food....everywhere the problem is because we are getting bankrupt in morality.

BBC is well known for its prejudiced reporting and their so called "exposure documentaries" on many issues.

                            I watched it yesterday and honestly I am stunned beyond words. The two lawyers were defending and justifying four men raping a helpless woman and pulling out the intestines with their hands! There has to be a drastic change in the education and legal system in India to change the mindset otherwise there will be many more maniacs like these committing such heinious crimes against women. I live in North America and whoever have watched this cannot believe what they saw and heard. I have my roots in India and I sincerely hope the young people of this generation can bring about a change and restore respect to women in the society and heal the wounds. I wish I could share the grief and sorrow in Nirbhaya's mother's face when she spoke about her daughter. I feel every adult Indian shoud watch this film and you will know what I am talking about.

                            Wholeheartedly agree with you Mrs. Sonia Singh!  Powerfully well expressed! Why ban the documentary? Ban the rapists!! Ban the system that strongly hinder our right to express our views? Ban those people who steal our freedom of speech!!  Ban the mindsets who are against to hear the very core of the other side that may very well be a milestone for stirring up and bringing awareness on such atrocities!!

                            The ban is really very unconvincing!...<br/>
Bollywood is exhibiting  vulgarity/ semi nudity / depicting women in a very sensual way and in a very cheap manner behaving with men in order to appease their sensual appetite yet people get to see it every where.... some times  without even any cuts!!!!<br/>
..But when a documentary film which  is highly relevant to the current hidden  mentality of most men around the world  which shows how crude the mentality of a convict is and how much suffering ordinary women undergo.... the film gets banned! <br/>
The film which might even   alert many innocent women to be careful..so that they could protect themselves by atleast not venturing out  odd hours as much as possible .and these women would realise that there is no use is demanding for security from centre or state or anyone else unless the mindset of many men changes and that the  convictsome times  dont even repent..and worst is that  they seem to think they did that right!.... it gets banned ...It is really strange and hurting the millions of  women  !

                            I just finished watching this film, and I wanted to add my perspective as someone living outside of India. I live in Canada. It was heart wrenching watching this film, and I give all my support to the women and their families enduring this.   First, after watching the film, I would never assume all men from India are rapists. In the protests, I saw the majority of protesters were men and heard their voices in the crowds.  Rape is serious and a worldwide problem.  Especially this violent brutal type of rape.  Even as a woman in Canada it is still an issue. The documentary should not be banned and should be seen as much as possible as documentaries open the lines of communication. Open lines of communication are how changes occur.  Several years ago, I saw a documentary on rape in the Congo and one soldier acknowledged (with a smile) that he had gang raped a woman. Then when the interviewer asked what he would do if his sister was raped, he was horrified. Then you saw the light go off in his eyes when he put the two together.  The film shouldn't be banned and as horrific as it is, it should be seen.

                            Very surprising. United States has a population much lower than India yet their rape crimes average per year is much more than that of India. Why does not the BBC do a documentary on US ?

                            The government gets no credit as banning this documentary is nothing but suppressing freedom of speech, shooting the messenger and implicitly supporting negative attitudes in our social fabric...actions which have no place in a democracy

                            We continue to call it a study of the mindset of the rapist while everyone knows that these are lame excuses and justification tutored to the convicted rapist by his defense lawyer. Just before the telecast of the documentary, news item on the net focused only interview and shocking words of the rapist intended to use as promo for the planned telecast. This is what shadowed the actual content and impact of the documentary and took away the purpose of the film even if it was good.

                            i watched the documentary and horrified.  i request all the apologists who were worried about country's image etc., keep yourself in the shoes of Nirbhaya's parents and think, before you try to defend one government or the other. <br/>
i would advise every college student and every parent to see this, and the government should lift the ban on this film.

                            okay,<br/>
this documentary have few conclusion <br/>
1) indian society is responsible for rape and crime against woman. <br/>
"since nirbhaya father sold his land for her daughters education he was exceptional in indian society.<br/><br/>
2) Men are evil creatures.<br/>
" during the protest they are many men and women and even children ... but we can cut the clip for all non women protester and showcase it as woman against the world, thank you.<br/><br/>
3)evil race :so in fact Indians did not rise as a nation or a race to protect its daughter, how can they they are racially inferior when it comes to civics in fact rapist being that they are is everything to do with them being indians <br/>
finally :: Indians are not 1 billion human beings with different opinions views and ethics they are one single backward religious and savage phony... thank you for the documentary i hope u r proud of you are self

                            You are right: the only people who spoke and acted in a dignified manner are the parents of the victim. However, one must not forget that ALL of them come from similar socio-economic layer: dirt-poor.<br/><br/>
It is the attitude to life. Rest are redundant.

                            Although I am personally not in favour of the ban, I do not approve of the manner in which Ms. Udwin had breached trust by not complying with certain agreed conditions and undertakings as pointed out by a co-producer of the said documentary Ms. Anjali Bhushan. Ms. Bhushan has herself stated that airing of the documentary despite her warnings with regard to breach of trust, reflects the personal ambition and publicity seeking of Ms. Udwin. I am unable to post her full statement here but can be checked out.

                            Dont understand people trying to shoot the messenger and asking BBC to make documentary on the social ills in the western world. Why are we deflecting attention here and not taking responsibility as adults? The western world may have problems, but they handle them with maturity and not like with the childish petulance we exhibit by banning things and shirking from our responsibilities every now and then. This is outrageous, every time someone shows us a mirror - we retort "well.. fix your home first". Modi has been nothing but a marketing genius... all fluff, but no actual content really. We now realize - "beti bachao beti padhao" is nothing but yet another well time slogan.

                            Amazing Indian system. The indian govt. is openly showing to the world, how shameless they are. By banning India's daughter, the Indian govt. is showing its shameless ways how it protects the perpetrators. I am a women, and I want this documentary to be Aired in every corner of the world and bring down the mask of this inhuman men. I am sure there are many men like this driver who need to understand some strong points. And the media.. Seriously? Where is your responsibility of using it for the benefit of the masses. YouTube person, goes on record to say that dey cannot air. Come on!! Atleast not expected from them. Is it then you need Nirbhaya's case only to show the women protesting and show how the rape happened and gain TRPs. This shows how our entire system is sick. I feel ashamed to be a woman in India. Never expected this from the media, who try to portray they are For women equality. Educated illetrates of our country. If at all you want to show your stand. All TV channels take a call and protest through airing India's daughter on your channels so the indian system realizes that this is something to not hide but to send across a strong message to the citizens of India.

                            In this age of globalization when the world has shrunk to a village level, world has become one community. What happens at one place tends to affect everyone else everywhere. We like it or not. Through honest Journalism we stay in touch, world wide, with each other. As Indians we feel incensed when unflattering stories are reported especially by foreign correspondents, about us. And at the same time we feel validated and consoled when it's mentioned that it happens in America as well. Sense of deep rooted nationalism amongst us is understandable. But we shall not close our eyes to what is so ingrained in our daily lives. We live dangerously ignoring that affects all of us regardless of what others think about us. We should consider 'rape &amp; misogyny' as the ills of society that should be eliminated to make ourselves civil and our families safe.<br/><br/>

                            This is all gimickry for TRPs. First of all why doesn't BBC talk about its own dirt in the background? Where rapes are much higher in UK and western world than India. And one rapist's mindset is not a representative of anything. In this 1.2 billion population with around 600 million men you may even find some people with cannibalistic mindset does it mean Indians love to eat other humans?

                            I personally feel that these sort of films which seem to show the perverted mentality of a convict wont help in the security of women or prevention of such crimes in the future even one bit!!!<br/>
It would perhaps  merely provide some sort of secret  mental entertainment for those who watch it and they are  are mostly educated elite working class !<br/>
They would watch it comment on it discuss  for a day and later forget it ..But no ordinary daily wage labourer who has such intentions  or perverted man  is going to watch the film  and gets reformed !The mindset needs to be addressed !<br/>
These men have been brought up from childhood in such a manner where they think that women are the property of men/women  are servants of men/women are for entertainment of men/women are  inferior and they should always follow certain rules and regulations and should be confined to four walls !these are the rules some e men have laid for the satisfaction of their ego and because they have some sort of insecurity and superiority complex  !<br/>
What is really needed is to impart human values to the male children especially those coming from uneducated drug abuse/alcohol abuse families or very low economic  strata of the society /or very reomote cillages that men and women are equal and women should be respected and honoured without any conditions imposed.

Thank you for clearly stating that India has good film producers to make such documentaries perhaps even better and we  do not need holy than thou international shoulders to cry on ..<br/>

                            Global problem is an excuse and cover off. If you want to show a Global problem, it can also be shown with interviewing criminals in their own country. Say for example, BBC could interview "Jimmy Saville sexual abuse" and show to world as a GLOBAL problem.

                            I can only conclude that ours is an self-centered-egoistic society, both Indian men and also Indian women have it equally. And because of this (ego), humans living in Indian society are hating and fighting each other and women are largely at the receiving end.

                            Why everytime Indian Government or Sciety showing frustration not sure and willing to change the status of ceime against womwn especially rape.<br/><br/>
What Govt of India has to do is to enact stringent law and equiped police with reform and use of forensic technology and gazettes by police. <br/><br/>
But this is hyprocratic society and Government himself is not willing to take this issue seriously and giving criminals freedom and legal protection to commit crime against women.

It was BJP when Parliament was attacked? What happen with promise to get rid of article 370 and all Kashmir Pundits will be able to move back to J&amp;K?<br/>

                            M.L. Sharma and A.K. Singh, the two lawyers should be permanently disbarred by the Bar Council. They have no respect for women who make up half of India's population. As lawyers they have a duty to defend any client but by condoning his rape and murder they have become accessories to his crime and should lose all right to be lawyers.

                            A ban on this documentary is simply ridiculous to say the least. My take from this is a message to face the monster, a sect of our culture has created, eye-to-eye and eradicate it from its roots. Banning it is like running away from it and off late we have been only doing that. So much for democracy!!

I remember in one of Barkha Dutt's shows on the subject of women's safety, one of the women in the audience remarked: if someone has to be banned, it should be men who should be banned from going out after dark, unless they can prove their character. Now that would be really something!<br/><br/>
As a woman and as the mother of a son, I feel doubly responsible: if we don't speak out against this, the society will never change.

                            Nirbhaya incident should be condemned in the best possible words. I am for the strictest of punishment for the rapists and favor changing the law if required to do so. However, problem is with the title of the documentary. As you said, its a global problem and where is the need to have India in title. Why is NDTV collaborating with foreigners in making documentary whose title conveys a different message. T India's brand value should not be impacted because of global problem of rape. I am a great fan of NDTV but feel its Time for you to introspect.

                            I will try to be as unbiased as possible.<br/><br/>
The documentry seems incomplete, I don't know why but it did a halfass job at telling  that not all men in India think in terms of thorns and flowers or fire @ farmhouse or rest of the junk displayed. <br/><br/>
The director was raped! well, I am sorry to hear that. but is that the reason enough to lose the objectivity?<br/><br/>
If the movie is about understanding social injustice/gender inequality that incompetant men try to enforce by assaulting women, then  there should have been some narration through out the way pointing it out. <br/><br/>
There was nothing enlightning about a pig and his shepherds trying to justify this crime against humanity. If you wanted to get to his core then you should have attest forced him to see that he is trying very hard to belive a lie that dosent stand a chance against the hard reality. <br/><br/>
Should have made the documentry with a naration for school kids. Should have contacted CBSC or respective authorities to get greater impact. But now this is nothing more than a TRP fight.<br/><br/>
Make a decision, do you want to be a journalist looking for a hot topic to sell or a civil resistor that is working towards a change. <br/><br/>
On the other hand:<br/><br/>
For a educated mind with a working brain cell and a shred of humanity, will see this as a eye-opening experience. and anyone who wants to ban this movie, should look into the mirror and slap himself to death.<br/><br/>
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BAN ANY THING IN A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.   Let people decide, good or bad. you are there to do your job as a civil servant. not as a king deciding fate of masses. you want to do it, then run to Pakistan not IN INDIA.<br/><br/>
Economic growth is one thing, social reforms are much needed in India. <br/><br/>
Here are some suggestions:<br/><br/>
1. Sex Education.<br/>
2. Equality reforms <br/>
3. End discrimination based on caste creed gender or sexual orientation/preference.<br/>
4. Learn to love yourself.<br/>
5. Don't be a Pakistani.

                            I too have seen this documentary.  It evokes a deep feeling of sympathy for the parents and an absolute hatred for both, the rapist and his lawyers.  It is particularly noteworthy that the lawyers are barely able to string a sentence together and so cannot be that educated, notwithstanding their licences to practice law in India.  Perhaps the lawyers typify the deep malaise that is part of India's legal system.  Little wonder that cases take generations to come to trial.  What is the most galling aspect of the documentary is the healthy and sinister looking Mukesh who casually sets out his own mitigating circumstances.  Hailing as he does from the slums of Delhi, this character leads a relatively charmed life in Tihar, complete with three square meals a day, bed and bedding, bathing and toilet facilities and no doubt entertainment at government expense.  His aforementioned lifestyle will continue for the foreseeable future.  Is it any wonder that rape continues apace in India?
