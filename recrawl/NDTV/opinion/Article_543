Headline::::Modi's 56-Inch Chest, Rahul's 58-Day Sabbatical - the Art of Image-Making



DateTime::::2015-05-04T22:39:00+05:30




                                Inflection points in image-building are very difficult things to achieve. A 58-day sabbatical seems to have allowed Rahul Gandhi to attempt the routinely impossible. Whether it was the Vipassana  that did it or whether there was a mystic 'Wise Counsel' that did some image enhancement exercises, nobody can quite figure yet. There are those who believe that since the government quite clearly knew where the young Congress scion was holed up, its silence, or rather its restraint in not exercising its well-honed faculty of leaking information, indicates his destinations were rather sedate.
There is no doubt that his timing for (attempted) change is impeccable. At the fag-end of the Modi sarkar's first year, there is a frisson of disappointment in some key places. Rahul Gandhi has used his new image to attempt what Manny Pacquiao was doing with Floyd Mayweather Jr... in their much-publicized Las Vegas bout. The prize money at stake here is more substantial than the boxing fest guaranteed. But the prize is largely Rahul Gandhi's, and even if he comes off like Pacquiao only as second best. He will then have achieved the impossible. For a man who was written off just two months ago, as a political nonstarter, the image transformation is quite substantial, even to a seasoned 'Image Guru'.  
Rahul has chosen, quite adroitly, the lowest-hanging fruit - disappointment in the farming community combined with anxiety about the new Land Acquisition Bill. The images that Rahul Gandhi portrayed are choreographed cleverly, but not entirely perfectly (but of that more later). The images are skillfully composed: talking to farmers and labourers perched on boris in the mandis of Punjab, squatting in trains, the day-long samvad padyatra with families of farmers who committed suicide in Amravati, Maharashtra.
There are comfortingly some elements that Rahul has carefully chosen to build on from his own recent past. He has exercised continuity - remember his protests in Uttar Pradesh over land for farmers? He has tried to draw a line between his attacks on the drug mafia in Punjab and the poor state of the rural communities there today. Continuity clearly is a vehicle that any image reconstruction requires. It is one that however needs enormous and substantial follow-up.
There are other instances too of Rahul Gandhi seemingly determined to project a new image, most tellingly in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament, where his intervention in the debate on the Land Bill was surprising. But Rahul has also taken 'baba steps' to break past perceptions. The padyatra to Kedarnath, synched to arrive just in time for the opening of the sacred shrine, was not without political symbolism, even if it was dubbed as a personal visit. Certainly it revealed that he was willing to take the battle for Hindu hearts and minds to the rival camp. It was just the move to catch political rivals by surprise; a message vastly different from that of those whose shrill claims of being the only voice of the Hindus are increasingly wearing thin. While continuity and consistency are vital, he has shown that the new emerging Rahul Gandhi is not averse to adding vital new dimensions to his persona.
Some new elements of imagery that Rahul has chosen are tough ones. Will it work depends in one instance on what may emerge eventually in brother-in-law Robert Vadra's interests in the same area. By meeting with harassed small flat buyers in Delhi, Rahul was making a brave attempt to tackle a constituency that Modi clearly had won the hearts and wallets of a long time ago. So he has stepped into new territory with a distinct divergence from worrying about farmers, the landless and tribals - long his only enthusiasm in days of yore.
Interestingly, there are elements from the past which Rahul has carefully chosen to jettison. For example there were no highly-publicized visits overnight to the homes of 'peasants', no 'Kalavati' moments, and no sit-down dinners in humble hovels of the marginalised.
Does all this actually work? The acid test of course is going to be whether the young scion decides to take on the infinitely bigger task of attempting to remake his own party. Redoing your own image is one thing, but redoing what is arguably the world's oldest political party is totally another thing. The entrenched interests, powerful citadels, carefully guarded-over multiple elections all deserve scrutiny. It's that image too that weighs down his progress. If they are like a ball and chain on his image, then these are big, brazen balls indeed.
While Rahul Gandhi Version 2.0 is well-timed, there still exist certain loose ends that can play spoiler to the otherwise carefully-crafted image. The old version still peeps out, as in the rather lackluster deportment at a not-so-effective farmers' rally in Haryana. His intervention in parliament on the net neutrality debate, though well-timed, spoke of his negligence on the issue - in his speech, Rahul Gandhi demanded that the government stop the TRAI deliberations immediately, harking back to an old image of tearing up a bill of the Manmohan cabinet. Also, for someone to fight for the cause of accessible internet while himself rebuffing the internet's foremost tools of accessibility such as Twitter and Facebook makes Rahul Gandhi's activism appear contradictory.
While opposing government policies and actions is important as an opposition member, what is also required is providing an alternative to craft an image that is beyond just anti-government. Gandhi's two recent speeches gave no hint of an alternative. Yes, it is important to raise issues in Parliament, it is equally important to follow up - in RG's case, he spoke on farmer suicides and land acquisition bill, but his absence during Home Minister Rajnath Singh's response was telling. It displayed a damaging lack of seriousness, of days gone by (or so we were told).
The recent Nepal condolence snafu only served to highlight the "Rahul as Pappu" image. The most charitable explanation, of course, was that he was merely reading a message on his phone that came in while he was supposed to be busy writing in the Visitors' Book at the embassy. But the lasting image was that of a lad who still hasn't quite found his mojo and relies on aides, add-ons and plug-ins more than politicians can afford. Crafting your own message and being seen as capable of crafting it are two entirely different things. But both are critical to anyone who hopes to make a mark in an environment dominated by an Image Natural like Modi.
Whether it is Modi's 56-inch chest versus Rahul's 58-day break, what's eventually going to make or break images is action. Results matter - and, of course, what happens when the cameras alight on you when you are not watching!(Dilip Cherian founder Perfect Relations is Image Guru to Corporates and Parties, an editorial flaneur he's sometimes syndicated, occasionally talking head for TV but specialist in giving face-lifts to beleaguered corporations and politicos.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It's pathetic analysis. Time has come for serious and journalism with substance. Last 15 years of Congress rule in Maharashtra where maximum number of suicides by Farmers in Vidarbha took place and Prince Rahul did not have time to visit them even once is now being projected as if Rahul is savior of Farmers.   This blog writer should have raised pertinent questions as to what Prince was doing in last 10 years when thousands committed suicides on account of agriculture distress.Everything has become cheap and theatrical in this country be it politics by RAGA, Blog writing , Journalism.

                            This is a typical Xian writing in praise of the family dumbo. I see no big deal in his return. As long as they keep hiding their misdeeds, be it Vadra, Sonia or Raga, they will never regain the faith of Indian people. First n foremost, is it not a fact that Vadra looted farmers and state govt was arm twisted into giving a clean chit. Is it not a fact that Pappu disappeared for last 10 years every now n then without informing the nation. Did he not recently disappear for 56 days that too to a foreign country. Are these qualities of a great leader??? So what are we writing n about whom. Is this the kind of leader we are looking for. If congress choose to have him to lead, it will be the darkest day for the country and Cong leaders will be the most useless people who have traded their intellect for dog biscuits

                            Seems the writer is next in line to become RGs image consultant. Rahul cannot come close to even to his family scions like Indra Gandhi. His listless, unenergetic and insubstantial journey of 44 years cannot be overcome by a 58 incognito counselling followed by sortie on a person who has come out with years of substance working hard from ground level. RG is no where near to be an  inspiring leader &amp; visionary.

                            What a load of rubbish analysing a simpleton incapable of performing at an interview, relying totally on sycophants like Scindia, Gogoi and other attack-dogs.  Cherian must be the only one who did not notice that while giving his speech, he was being prompted by Scindia.  The rather stupid Gogoi also gets his two naya paise worth; readers will remember his barb about Modi's 56 inch chest when speaking on a topic that had no bearing on said chest! Cherian an image guru?  Ha! Ha!  He needs to improve his own image first.  He looks scruffy to say the least.

                            Firstly to Dilip sir - Modi's 56-Inch Chest - he did by being 'present' and proclaiming using hindi metaphor, Rahul's 58-Day Sabbatical, in plain words was done by being 'absent', and if you look on internet the exat meaning of sabbatical is 'a period of paid leave granted to a college teacher for study or travel, traditionally every seventh year'. People knew better hence congress got 44 seats. Mind you if such theatrics continue and in next election they cross 100 seats, means nothing on Rahul's popularity front, as you also have to see other side, i.e. how low can a party go.<br/>
Secondly, for few posts of readers, if you think giving packages to famers alone is going to stop unfortunate suicide of farmers, then it should have worked in 10 yrs and shown some result. Inspite of huge loans waiver in first term of UPA and their commitment, we all agree, but on ground no new policies were done to improve storage, infrastructure for faster transportation of goods, irrigation, etc. Normal growth in industrial, agriculture, education and judiciary is not going to solve mounting and stagnant problems of India. We need swift action and also support of common man. No PM, present Modi or past anyone, can be magician to fix things in couple of years, show trust in present PM, as he is only strong leader at present who can lead us, rest were given a chance and did not deliver as much, not saying nothing was done. Wish prosperity for all Indians.

                            Amazing that people &amp; journalists are saying Rahul is the new improved version and all that crap. What he has done is merely 80's Indira Gandhi style of symbolism. Go visit poverty stricken families when you are in opposition and claim you stand with poor of the country. From Kalawati to doing labour job in Nike shoes to farmer rally to sleeping &amp; eating in a Dalit's house to travelling in a Mumbai local train to the padyatra. All of this is done. After doing all this, what is ONE thing that Rahul has suggested to change policies that will work in long term to lift people out of poverty, to improve agriculture productivity? Let's not forget, as per his claims 64% of Indian's are in agriculture and govt can't ignore them. That 64% population contributes just 18% to India's GDP. Why after 55 years of pro-farmer &amp; pro-poor government's led by his family members has agriculture remind so unproductive? why has his family shouting 'garibi hatao' since 1970's not managed to uplift even one person out of poverty? If anything the rural folks have only gone deeper into poverty.  These are the questions that journalists should be asking the prince. Instead, he makes 1-2 silly speeches written by some chamcha and media goes gaga over how Rahul is back.

                            The suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than the suicide rate among all Indians. Only it is a highly politicised issue. While all depressed people require help and support, the way this issue has been handled, both by media and politicians, leaves much to be desired. This is not an issue to gather votes or TRPs. This reveals the holes in our agrarian policy that needs urgent repair and both politicians and the media need to concentrate on that.

                            Are Farmers the only people residing in India? What about rest of the population who are not farmers? For all the SOP's that farmers are getting (or expecting to get), where is the money coming from? How many farmers pay taxes that contribute to the exchequer? For all those people who think everything is an entitlement, it is the Taxes generated by the businesses and employees that pays for all the entitlements. So, no businesses means no entitlement. So, let us stop talking about the support for business community and see how to improve farming sector..... Ohhh... wait a minute... our farmers are still using century old technique to farm and are not willing to adapt newer techniques... not willing to use insurance (because it costs money and they don't want to give up a share of their earnings)....

                            I think it's time for all Indian to take a step back and a deep breath in and out to clear their routinely programed brains or think outside of the box as it is called in many cultures.  There are several key points:<br/><br/>
1. Where has India gotten it's food grain, fruits, to nuts from?<br/>
2.  Where/What were they traditionally grown in India? Second part to this question is: is that land still stainable to growth or has external factors such as pollution, deforestation, or climate change impacted any of the above?<br/><br/>
The land issue as it has been referred to since the creation of the nation of India, was never able to be fully resolved. One issue was even with the mass service of the surveyors who trekked from hill to forest and coast to coast.  No clear indicators was able to be identified.  One major factor was language, culture and the hierarchy of the local area survey.<br/><br/>
As in common sense, there has never been one direct entity that has governed all of India or South Asia prior to partition of land.  These are intrinsically emotionally issues and should be for a whole nation to think about seriously.<br/><br/>
Even with tremendous growth and an increase in the illiteracy rate, many more factors affect a nation.<br/><br/>
Self sustenance has been the route taken by most successful nations created and it has worked for the majority of them in modern times regardless of irresponsible connotations.  Our only common language is English in this country even Hindi has many branches.<br/><br/>
Firstly, I suggest that M.P and Congress VP be able to go about his task without hinderance and grandiose opinion taking.  Secondly, no party has run a clear cut National Election that goes as far netted as the one run by the Congress Party in the last 10 years.  This is is something to celebrate and continue to build upon.  We do no yet know all our neighbors and their food, culture or clothing let alone what their mind thinks or wanders about aimlessly when the subject of food and nutrition balance is a top priority for most governments if not homes.<br/><br/>
We have to feed our brain properly and it has to be food first and proper nutrition in equal parts to share with enemy and foe alike.  For every fight even within a family as humble as our once nightly trade arm of a nation began with the first meal of the day and what will we be eating later that night.<br/><br/>
Modern times did not change the common sense of every farmer that has ever plowed the earth.  Perhaps material conquests put the appetite to rest for a bit but the mind always wants more and more.  Why not feed it properly and sustain it with books and an education?<br/><br/>
My background has lived in the land over the mighty Hindu Khush mountains since the time was counted and could be found to be relevant in the world's history books.<br/><br/>
In conclusion, we have to keep the heart of the farmers in our mind before mindlessly building and urbanizing good farmland.  An illiterate man even knows the basic fruits of the earth and that has always been every god's given right.<br/><br/>
If you would like to see a movie example of these themes, I suggest "Mother India" known around the world and felt deeply in the heart of many agricultural communities that continue to sustain India through difficult times.

                            Well balanced analysis of Rahul Baba. However, the author's left wing superiority complex shows in the sentence where he uses the word shrill to describe the right-wing noise. In case of rahul though, his thoughts are well shrouded in language. These left-wing types perhaps don't know or don't care that they themselves uniformly come out as shrill while even remotely referring to BJP and sangh, or any other uncommunist people. Arrogant grandpa!!
