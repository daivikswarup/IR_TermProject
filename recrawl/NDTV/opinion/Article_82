Headline::::Mamata, Kejriwal And Mukesh Together In Bengal



DateTime::::2016-01-14T16:47:00+05:30




                                This past weekend was personally and politically very satisfying. The successful conclusion of the Bengal Global Business Summit 2016, the sense of quiet optimism and confidence about the state's future and its economic prospects, the regard for the maturity with which the Mamata Banerjee government has gone about rebuilding the business environment over the past four-and-a-half years was all heartening. We have miles to go, but we have come a long way.
From Haryana to Karnataka to Gujarat, state business summits - events where states showcase their business potential and investment opportunities - are quite the norm now. Usually, they take place every two years. In West Bengal, we do it every year. There are two reasons for this. It helps us monitor the progress made since the previous summit and see how much of the promised investment has actually reached the ground. It is a reality check in the quickest possible time.
Besides that, Bengal had been reduced to such a mess by the CPI(M)-led government (1977-2011) that the Trinamool government had to make special efforts to revive the spirit and drive home the message that something new was happening. An annual business summit was part of this initiative.
This year the numbers stacked up nicely and Rs. 250,000 crore was committed by a variety of Indian and international investors. But that was not all there was to the Summit. West Bengal sees itself as a link between the Indian market and the economies to the east of our country. Expanding on this gateway theme, the Bengal government invited the Prime Minister of Bhutan Tshering Tobgay, and a delegation from Bangladesh, led by Commerce Minister Tufail Ahmed, to make presentations at the Summit as partners of Bengal.
Following up on her meeting with Mamata Banerjee in Britain in 2015, Priti Patel, Minister of State for Employment in the David Cameron government and the Indian diaspora face of the Conservative Party, also participated. Incidentally, the Bhutanese Prime Minister has a strong Bengal connection, having studied at Dr Graham's School in Kalimpong, and recalled his many friends in Kolkata.
In keeping with the enlightened federal politics of our country, four union ministers were gracious enough to come - Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari. These crucial infrastructure ministries are betting big on Bengal and eastern India and Mamata Banerjee's government has been most cooperative in this regard.
Perhaps for the first time, the Chief Minister of a state participated in the business summit of another state. Arvind Kejriwal was the perfect guest but made his pitch for Delhi as a business city. Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, sent a minister-led team.
What struck me was how statesmanlike the interaction of politicians was on the dais, despite political differences. Some in the media were looking for a silly "Jaitley versus Kejriwal" story but the two men, experienced and tested in their own ways, maintained their dignity and were absolutely correct.
An array of leading businessmen came to Kolkata for the Summit. Mukesh Ambani, who launched the Jio telecom network in the city two years ago, was effusive enough to say, "Bengal ranks high in terms of ease of doing business." He had reason to say this. As Reliance has rolled out its optical fibre network, it has got cooperation from municipal corporations in Kolkata and other cities and from the state government. There has been no rent seeking or harassment.
In 2014, Jio set up a free wi-fi facility for all of Kolkata with no limits to the sites one could access. This was a teaser programme to encourage users to buy subscriptions. Yet, to me, it was revealing that free wi-fi was possible without restricting access to the Internet and limiting it to a few sites. It was an early lesson in the potentialities of net neutrality.
Yogi Deveshwar, the chairman of ITC, was very prominent at the Summit. The Kolkata-headquartered conglomerate is close to finishing the construction of a super-luxury hotel in the city, tentatively called the ITC Grand Bengal. This will be its second five-star property in Kolkata, after the ITC Sonar. One of the achievements of the Trinamool government has been to keep companies like ITC anchored in Kolkata. Through the turbulent Communist years, so many major business groups left Kolkata, exiting wholesale or reducing their headquarters to postal addresses, not functional centres. It could have happened to ITC too, but thankfully the mood has changed in the state government and in Virginia House. That is why, when Deveshwar said "Mamata Banerjee has nerves of steel and a heart of gold", those words carried such resonance.
Rather than a big hotel, Mamata Banerjee hosted the opening dinner for the dignitaries in the picturesque, 400-acre Eco Park, a lakeside recreation facility that is a favourite of Kolkata residents. There are 14 cottages here - ideal for holidaying families (let me promote tourism in my state!) - and one artiste cottage. Mamata Banerjee used the artiste cottage for her one-to-one meetings, perhaps the most aesthetic setting for business discussions.
It was a cool evening in Kolkata, Arvind Kejriwal's muffler wasn't enough and Mamata Banerjee gave him a shawl for extra cover. I discovered that Mukesh Ambani doesn't eat on Fridays, spending the day fasting but keeping himself going on only tea. I also discovered - re-discovered - the multiple skills of my party colleague, Amit Mitra, the indefatigable Finance and Industry Minister of West Bengal, who was the emcee for the whole Summit.
My personal takeaway from the Summit, besides the exhilaration and the fatigue, is a curiosity about Bhutan, a country I have never visited. Talking to the visiting Prime Minister, I was intrigued by the Happiness Index and of course the beauty of the country. Now we have a Druk Air flight that connects the spanking new Andal (Durgapur) airport to Paro. Maybe I need to get on that flight one of these weekends.(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Kolkata had all the infra it needed to be a mega city post independence, but the lazy commies and their downright stupid policies screwed it rotten. To top it off the people elected them over and over again. Now it is just a namesake metro with the political leadership unwilling to do the right thing but instead pander to the votebanks. And there's no hope of change anytime soon..Dream on Derek..

                            Derek O'Brien, who played the lead in disrupting parliament is now trying to establishment the credibility of his state!  If this wasn't so sad it would be laughable.  The luminaries present at the summit were there by way of duty rather that freewill.  Priti Patel also welcomed Modi at the House of Commons in the UK.  O'Brien is perhaps too stupid to realise that Priti is a Gujarati and it was O'Brien who publicly called Modi the 'Butcher of Gujarat'.  Why no mention of the terrible Muslim riots in Malda which his boss tried to pass off as a dispute between the BSF and locals.  She insulted the BSF whose personnel lay their lives on the line to protect India.  It is only a question of time before the public ask for heads to roll in the Sarada scam.  All in all, a poor attempt to whitewash the perils the state faces under an incompetent Mamata aided by goons like Derek who do India tremendous harm by their activities in the National parliament!

                            It takes decades to build credibility. Derek, individually well educated, lost all his credibility in Parliament, by Kejriwal chhap (brand) comments. And with this blog, his intellectuals also in doubt. No depth in writing, its just like secondary school's essay... My visit to trade fair !!!

                            Neither has Bengal come a long way, nor will it ever go a long way forward. It is true that the left, especially CPM ruined Bengal's industries during its 33 long years in power. Mamata and TMC are no better. She showed her true colors when she made it impossible for the Tata's to function in Singur. The true state of Bengal was exposed by the Calcutta High Court when it wondered who would come and open industries in God forsaken Bengal. Only fools will expect the BGBS 2016 to yield anything. O'Brien is as usual living in a fools paradise. Even if Mamata wins the Assembly polls, Bengal's backward slide will not stop. And with Kejriwal as Mamata's BFF, the future can be easily predicted.

                            it is intreting that kejriwal used to abuse mukesh ambani  and  mamatadi always against any investment suddenly find virtue in investment and mr brien sees merit. industrialists are more experienced in dealing with all type of politicians and they will invest only if they are comfortable and feel safe abt new investments.

                            Really like the optimism of Derek. Heartbreaking to see and intelligent person like him defying logic while represent TMC and presenting such thoughts - while knowing the ground reality of West Bengal. A certain waste of talent - but again power corrupts and makes people have crazy points of view.

                            In a state which borrows from the market and organises functions, where street food is called an industry only hard times lie ahead. So much money is spent on populist policies that is gnawing this debt heavy state.

                            It is true when Derek says that,"We have miles to go but we have come a long way". Bengal is still recovering from the ills that were caused by the Left govt. and the pre-election riot strategy used by the BJP. Amidst all the problems, major developments are underway, but still the "BJP Paid Trolls" are hellbound on stopping these developments in Bengal. We must get rid of these outsiders who don't care about us and more about their party coming to power an taking over Bengal. What development has Modiji done? Ache din kab aaye aur gaye? Yeh toh pata hi nahi chala. People of Bengal unite and chase these BJP &amp; Left government goons away from our state before its too late.

                            Modi started all this and he has been good with it. All these do nothing commies and congresis out of jealousy attacked him for the very same thing they want to copy. Anyway it is going sign at least Bengal at last understands the importance of business.  This even didn't get much publicity, When Modi did it in Gujarat, everybody talked about this.

Bengal Business Summit has shown that there are people who want to do business in Bengal, so economical growth and business booming in Bengal is great news, being a business person myself its good to see the upward growth of West Bengal.

                            We have miles to go, but we have come a long way. Very honest view of West Bengal. Over the last 2-3 years there has been a marked improvement in both Kolkata and West Bengal, as far as quality of living. This will naturally lead to an improved business environment. In fact New Town/Rajarhat area is very similar to IT hubs such as Gurgaon. Bengal seems to be on the right track - good luck Derek and your team.

                            I hear a lot of talk on business class seats that will not be occupied, thus direct flights to EU and US not provided to Kolkata. I want to understand if more than 20% seats of these flights ex Delhi / Mumbai are business !.. thus 80% seats are economy only. <br/>
Corporate sector employees mostly travel in economy seats, only top level corporate officials along with business / entrepreneurs travel business. Kolkata has surely less of that since companies have HQ in Delhi / Mumbai, but lot of seats for US / EU ex our Delhi &amp; Mumbai are filled up by traffic from east (surely Kolkata). <br/>
Thus govt. must make more attempts to change perceptions of airlines and introduce direct flights ... which will boost the image of the state and improve arrival of foreign tourists to this region.
