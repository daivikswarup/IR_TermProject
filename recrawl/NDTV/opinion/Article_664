Headline::::St Stephen's Principal Valson Thampu on Sex Harassment Claim by Student



DateTime::::2015-06-21T12:17:00+05:30



A chemistry student at Delhi University has accused an assistant professor at St Stephen's College of sexual harassment and alleged that Principal Valson Thampu tried to protect him. This is Rev Thampu's response.Bad news for those who want to revel at the expense of the College.
To begin with - I would like to clarity that the complainant is not a student of St Stephen's College. She's a registered research student of Delhi University. Her research guide happens to be a faculty member at Stephen's. As per regulations of the college, research students who come to labs are required to sign an attendance register which the complainant utterly refused to do.
I give below the chronology of events, for facts do not lie.
(1) 10 December 2014.  The complainant meets the Principal with the grievance that Dr. Satish Kumar, her research guide, subjected her to sexual harassment in 2013.  She complains further that Dr. Kumar was not taking any interest in her research work. The Principal advises her to file a complaint with the Internal Complaints Committee, a statutory body meant to address such cases. The complainant resolutely refuses to do so, saying all she wants is to earn her Ph.D degree and the Principal should help her in this respect.  She tells the Principal that her father and sister want to meet with him and an appointment is granted.
(2) A week later the father and sister of the complainant together with her meet the Principal in his office. With folded hands, the father pleads with the Principal not to turn this into a complaint of sexual harassment as it could result in a scandal and also affect his daughter's chance of getting a Ph.D. The Principal should prevail on the research guide to help finish the doctoral work quickly. The Principal promises to help.
(3) A few days later the Principal calls a meeting of the complainant and the accused at which both agree on completing the work latest by the end of July 2015.  The complainant does not utter a word about sexual harassment. The Principal also offers to the complainant that he could see if a different guide could be secured for her.  The complainant insists on completing the remaining research with Dr. Kumar.
(4) On the 9th of January 2015, the complainant meets the Principal and for the first time, submits a written complaint alleging sexual harassment as well as sexual assault on the part of Dr. Kumar (going back to 2013). But she reiterates her keenness to continue research under Dr. Kumar as, according to her signed statement, "80% of my work is finished". The letter states, "I am really thankful for your support and I trust that you will take all necessary steps to help me take my Ph.D degree".  The Principal insists that given the nature of the complaint (i.e. sexual assault) it needs to be registered with the ICC.  The complainant then writes on the same complaint, "I don't wish this to be treated as a case of sexual harassment.... the matter should be treated as closed."
(5) On January 10 2015, the complainant meets with the Principal with a handwritten request reiterating the request made on the previous day (9. 1. 2015) "not to pass on the document to the internal complaints committee of the College" as she needs "time to re-think". Requests the Principal to wait till she files another written statement.  The Principal tells her it is impossible to wait indefinitely. Gives her three days to make up her mind.  At this stage the complainant reveals that she had filed a complaint of sexual harassment with the University Department. She wanted to go and withdraw the same.
(6) 14 January 2015: The complainant does not turn up. The Principal files all relevant papers with the Internal Complaints Committee.
Ironically, the complaint was filed not by the complainant but by the Principal. Yet he is accused of shielding the culprit and brain-washing the victim.
These are the bare facts, all supported by documents submitted by the complainant. They are being shared with those who care to know the truth and in defence of the image and integrity of St. Stephen's College.
It is absolutely certain that the complainant, on her own, would not have made these wild allegations against the College or the Principal. Fortunately many people know the forces playing behind all these.  As the old proverb goes, a wolf in wolf's clothing is not as dangerous as a wolf in sheep's clothing. The clothing is question is already like the Emperor's clothes. It is completely see-through.   
The complainant is not a student of St. Stephen's College. The Principal does not have, as such, any authority over her. He could not have prevented her from seeking redressal from the relevant committee. The Principal has no coercive power on her.  
As usual, any rumour about St. Stephen's is a media goldmine. It is this that encourages certain unscrupulous elements (here I am NOT referring to the complainant) to seek sadistic media limelight at the expense of the college.(Valson Thampu is the Principal of St Stephen's College, University of Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Fact that matters. Research Student, ok, from DU, reported about sexual misconduct about your faculty member and your excuse is that it was discretionary to report it? Why are you in the chair of the administrator then? This is the problem when non-administrators and non-scholars are appointed heads of academic institutes. If this is the character and excuse of the head, can only imagine the mediocre citizens it will continue to produce.

                            Reading this article and believing in most of it - one can still easily see how the victim told the truth. We all the kind of pressures we face from our parents and family to "adjust" and how scared they are when we protest against injustice. Because unfortunately they know from experience that the system doesn't honor anyone's fight for justice. Maybe her parents forced her to "adjust" and "resolve" the issue to protect her career and "reputation" (India sucks, but I am digressing!). The only real issue here is whether he did it - if he did, he should be behind the bars - tortured long essays by the Principal is besides the point.

                            Surprising there are no comments. It's a good explanation why this has been going on for 2 years. This needs to be investigated and case should be bought against the woman if these facts are true or vice versa.

                            Yes, this whole thing is indeed about you Mr. Thampu. You are the victim here. These are wild allegations and indeed a conspiracy hatched ONLY to make your life difficult. Utter insensitivity and arrogancey drip from every word that you have written. It seems you are an unpleasant egotist without compassion.

                            After thorough investigation the culprit should be punished. If the report filed by women is false, then her Ph.D. degree should be cancelled. If professor found to be culprit then he should not be allowed to teach.

                            Extremely unfortunate response by the head of such an illustrious institute. A student, no matter whether she is a DU student or your own, complains about sexual harassment of YOUR faculty, and you keep on giving excuses that she pleaded not to consider it as a complaint. Considering her vulnerability, you should have sorted this matter the very first day to was brought to your notice. On top of that you are blaming others for politicizing it. Such principal should be removed with immediate effect. He is a shame on St. Stephen's.

                            As an administrator, you are supposed to report the alleged crime and let police do the investigation. Your excuse is like police saying why do anything if victim doesn't want to report, esp. as the victim and offender know each other. What part of it do you not get it?

                            Today the media believes in sensationilsm. Also anybody who takes the media head on will be hounded out every now and then hoping the individual/institution will finally prostrate before the hypocrytic media. The media is becoming like the boy who cried wolf. News has become more like comic relief rather than a matter of information. By the way media has left Tomar, the law minister of Delhi. The media are like vultures looking for fresh prey every day.

                            Mr. Thampu should remember anyone doing a sexual assault will never do it in front of a 3rd person including one Mr. Thampu. The assailant will do it in private. The alleged victim has every right as an Indian citizen to report an incident of sexual violence to the police whether Mr. Thampu likes it or not. I salute the victim for her decision to come forward.

                            We must listen to both sides of a story.<br/>
Therefore, we must allow both sides to present their story.<br/>
Only then we can decide who is at fault and what action to take.<br/>
It is the same here in the West.<br/>
If we only listen to one side of a story then whose side should you pick?<br/>

                            Points 1 and 2 sounds less like a factual story than "your side of the story". <br/>
Further, the moment you are informed of the incident you are supposed to take an official action which can be at least an inquiry. Because you not only care for the student but also about a potential social threat roaming freely in the college.  I don't think watching student or her father folding her hands sufficiently relieves you of your duties.

                            Even the girl was duplicitous since she secretly filed a complaint with Dept but did not inform Principal while wanting his help. The Principal had offered her all options. She was afraid  to pursue   as she rightly feared delay in PhD, given the culture in our society where the complainant usually gets victimized and justice is delayed. The principal was wrong in bringing an irrelevant factor of her not being a student of his college into his decision-making. The Principal is right on his other arguments.

                            Its a shame on such a reputed institution. In Indian context any woman would like to address such a case without getting her name affected. Its the responsibility of the principal to address it with sensitivity.. He failed miserably for such a long time to resolve this and worse trying to paint it as though he has done everything required but the student didnt co-operate. Utterly narcissistic. How does it matter whether its a research student or full time student. Am sure he is not going to read the comments here. His job is over by posting this ' degrading womanhood ' article..

                            This only underscores that complainant was put in vulnerable position and was in a fix. It was for principal to take appropriate action against his staff so that not only the particular issue is addressed but the faculty is taken to task so that it will not happen with another student who as well may be a student from St Stephens. While we appreciate frankness of principal, St. Stephens may need internal Lokpal who is not on the staff to address this delicate issue. The principal seems to have completely focused on complainant, whereas his job is to ensure no faculty member misbehaves as a part of their role with St Stephens.It is immaterial who the target is.

                            In any organization there are procedures to deal with sensitive and important matters. Just because someone is at the top of the organization does not entitle him to do whichever course of action he likes to take<br/><br/>
In this sensitive issue it is equally important to hear both sides -girls as well as the professor.As a woman it is more damaging for her reputation in the Indian society.  The girl and the parents were not willing to treat it as a complaint.How does the principal know that the professor is targetted by the girl as he may not be giving credits for her improper research? And the case is a sensitive,critical and important. That is why a committee is there in place to look into all such complaints. Why did the girl and parents refuse to treat it as a complaint and then later lodge a complaint with Delhi Univ dept. ??<br/><br/>
And again with too little information why we viewers are passing judgements ?Even the regular courts pass judgments  after many hearings . Here then how can we pass judgements ? Opinions are fine.<br/><br/>
My opinion is that the principal has acted in the right way and the law should take its course. I also suspect what the principal has said at the end. Some one wants to bring in a bad reputation for St. Stephans

                            Nowadays its a convenient way to cite the so called "Forces behind all these...." if you want the matter to be curbed. Even AsaramBapu said that there are "Forces behind all this to malign him". At that time the Progressive Liberal Democratic enlightened Media didn't give him space to put forward "His Side of the Story" the way it is given in this case.

                            I am glad that I have not taken a PhD student. This kind of thing easily can happen with any female student. Seventeen years of academic experience taught me that students cheat at every opportunity and they can easily can go to any extent to get PhD if they desire so but without doing research!<br/><br/>
If this incident has happened in 2013 means that it should end there immediately there with immediate complaint, but it did not happen, which means the student could have used it for her own benefit and more over it could be intentional as well.

                            Are we so procedure-oriented that unless the complaint is made formally to a particular committee, we would not act on it? Is it not the responsibility that any problem reported (written or otherwise) should be looked into with the seriousness it deserves (and based on the nature of sensitivity, handle the issues with the sensitivity it deserves) and ensure that the problem gets resolved? Can there be excuses for not acting on the complaint (only because the parents or the girl do not want it to be formal for fear of repraisal)?

                            If a complaint of sexual harassment was brought to the Principal's notice, it was his duty, irrespective of what the girl/her father had to say, to escalate the matter to police and then other internal committees. It was not Principal's call to keep quiet for one year. The girl was concerned about her social image, but the Principal had moral responsibility of reporting the matter to police, in which he clearly failed! Above all he has the nerve of making remarks such as "Emperor's clothes" ....wonder if the Principal would have used the same logic if the girl in question was his daughter!!!

                            The student is obviously suffering in the throes of a typical victim's dilemma if whether she should complain and be subject to media scrutiny and lose valuable educational career time.... or should she just bury it and get her degree and move on in life...? The latter is chosen by most victims in India and thus the tyranny of the rapist thrives.....<br/>
And the principal isn't even able to empathise with this situation..... is he even qualified to be the principal of an institution to which parents entrust their impressionable/gullible children?
