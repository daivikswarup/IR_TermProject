Headline::::AAP Punished for Defeating Modi, Minister Treated like Terrorist



DateTime::::2015-06-12T16:13:00+05:30




                                History is cruel and ruthless, but it is neutral. Most of the time it does not side with the vanquished, but victors are not spared either. In the run-up to the 2014 national election, Narendra Modi was hailed as a charmer. But after a year in power, one finds it more difficult to describe him as one. His body language has changed and the shoulders have drooped. But what has not changed is his style and ego. He still hates to lose and still won't forgive adversaries.
Fortunately or unfortunately, AAP defeated him in Delhi so overwhelmingly, that it broke many myths about his invincibility. So our premonition was that the organisation and individuals linked to AAP would have to bear the brunt of being on his wrong side.
What we had not anticipated, however, was that a cabinet minister would be treated like a terrorist. An FIR would be lodged in the dead of the night when the whole world was fast asleep. At 3 am.
By 10 am, when Jitender Singh Tomar, law minister of Delhi and AAP legislator from Trinagar, was sitting in his constituency office, he found himself surrounded by policemen. Seven of them were of the Assistant Commissioner of Police rank and they came in 33 cars.
When Mr Tomar sat in his official car, his driver was shoved aside and an officer of ACP rank took charge of the steering wheel. No notice was served, no summons were issued to him. Even the court was incensed by the Delhi Police's brazenness. While hearing the bail application of Mr Tomar, the court told the police, "your notice seems to be a farce... And when he was cooperating in the investigation then what was the hurry to arrest him?"
It's different matter that the court granted the police four days of custody.
I am not talking here about Mr Tomar's educational certificates. That matter is pending in the Delhi High Court and the court is the only authority to pass a judgment on whether the documents are genuine or fake.
But what is seriously questionable is the conduct of the police. When the matter was already pending in court, then why was an FIR suddenly registered? The court had ordered Mr Tomar to produce all relevant documents to prove his innocence. The next date of hearing was in August. There was no fresh complaint and no fresh evidence had cropped in. The bar council had complained to the police on May 9. In between police could have registered a fresh FIR which it did not. What baffles me is the timing of the FIR and the entire operation.
On June 7, the Delhi Anti Corruption Branch had reopened 100 crore CNG-fitness scam in which three top IAS officers, including the chief secretary during the Sheila Dikshit regime, were in the dock. In this case, the role of the Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and former chief minister Sheila Dikshit was also under the scanner. The LG had declined permission to prosecute senior officers and the CBI had questioned that denial of permission in its closure report.
Even the ACB had requested permission three times to prosecute and every time it was denied. Both the ACB and the CBI had written that there was a prima facie case against all three officers, but the LG did not budge. The reopening of the case will certainly open a can of worms. Many senior politicians of both the BJP and the Congress, apart from Sheila Dixit, the LG and the officers could be in serious trouble.
The day after the case was re-opened, in a very swift move, the LG appointed a joint commissioner of police, Mukesh Meena to the ACB, superseding the incumbent chief. One must not forget that no such post exists in the department. The chief minister who was very keen to strengthen the ACB, was not consulted. This was an attempt to stall the CNG-fitness case investigation and save the culprits from being booked.
It is also important to underline the fact that Mr. Meena is the same officer who allegedly tried to implicate Kumar Vishwas and Manish Sisodia in the Gajendra Singh suicide case. It can't be a coincidence. Meena was brought with  malafide intentions.
There is a method to this madness. When things were going smoothly for the Delhi government, all of a sudden the duly elected Chief Minister was informed through a home ministry notification that he had no powers to appoint his officers. He was also told that the ACB was beyond his jurisdiction and that it directly reports to the LG. The Home Ministry had forgotten that on May 25, the Delhi High  Court has written in para 44 of its order that the Delhi Government has executive power over the ACB.
The Delhi ACB has been working under the direct supervision of the Chief Minister for the last 40 years and no questions were ever raised. Then why this sudden realisation? For the last two months every appointment made by the Delhi government had been declared null and void by the home ministry via the LG.
It is a brazen attempt by the Modi government to suffocate the Delhi government led by Arvind Kejriwal. The BJP tried its level best to avoid holding elections in Delhi. During President's Rule it tried to break AAP and install a government led by the BJP.  Mr Modi did not want a non-friendly government in the national capital. But he was helpless before the will of the people. Since he can't punish the people, AAP has to face the music.
This is not new. Those who know Mr Modi also know how he dealt with voices of dissent in Gujarat. Threat, coercion, intimidation, arrest, jail, humiliation were routine. Many senior IAS and IPS officers likes of Pradeep Sharma, Sanjeev Bhatt, Rajneesh Rai, Satish Verma and Rahul Verma who crossed his path landed in jail or had to languish in pitiable conditions. Sanjay Joshi's case is an example for everyone to remember.
Arvind Kejriwal and AAP dared take Mr Modi on. Arvind visited Gujarat to expose his model of development just before the parliamentary elections. Then he fought the parliamentary elections from Varanasi against Mr Modi and finally humiliated him in the Delhi elections by winning by such a big margin.
It's an open secret that Mr Modi does not forget either his friends or his foes. Arvind and AAP by no stretch of imagination are on the list of his friends. So either face the music or surrender.
The Tomar case is a trailer. I won't be surprised if many of us land up in jail. But AAP will fight come what may. The movement is on, and history should record it.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Now that it is proved that the certificates provided by Tomar are fake and your party has decided to suspend him, do you feel like an idiot by writing this rant and being exposed publicly? Or do you want to repeat the "I made a mistake, please forgive me" saga??

                            You forgot to mentioned, Arvind visited Gujarat to expose his model of development just before the parliamentary elections and BJP won all 26 seats in Gujrat. Then he fought the parliamentary elections from Varanasi against Mr Modi and lost badly but fortunately was not among 425 out of 439 other candidates that didnt lose deposit, an unbreakable record.

After their expulsion ,all that burden has fallen on this poor chap.Dear Ashuthosh, stop fooling yourself and us.You can not defend your dump boss.

Further what are your views on your Ex Law Minister's voilence against his Wife.... Fortunately or Unfortunately both the people caught on the wrong foot were the Law Ministers of AAP Govt. so one can imagine what sort of governance one can expect.

If you are only going to blame Modi for everything happening in your lives...its lame, immature and plain stupid. I know you guys are like a housing society party but even they have a certain maturity level in dealing with day to day issues. Fortunately or for lack of better words, STUPIDLY, Delhi has chosen you guys. You need to start proving that you belong to politics and start showing some spine by delivering results.

                            Sorry, People of Delhi did not give you 67 seats to fight with Central Government on every minor issue or aim at making Kejriwal the PM. Delhi people expect you to deliver on your promises and not point fingers at Modi Governments working. Congress had done better job in delhi with just 40 seats and you with 67 seats and no opposition are still only making noise and finding fault with others. same MCD was there during Congress rule. why can't you manage better. you are supposed to make officers work with you with confidence and they don't need your threats and regular interference in their working.

                            Uncle, history is not neutral. It reflects the point of view of those who write it. For instance, India's own history has been distorted in the past 60 odd years and reflects Marxist and colonizers' view rather than Indian view. Get off the Internet and get an education. Real university and real degree.

                            I think we'll have to see this situation context specify. In the neutral sense and without involving AAP, this is certainly a harsh treatment. But now if you see this in the context of AAP, it doesn't seem to be inappropriate at all. Given the high standards claimed by AAP, they should not be treated leniently like other politicians. Else this will be like high standards for others and for us no standards. Why? Because we think so. This is Hippocratic. Why AAP did not expel him so far? AK's response was he convinced me...this is a dangerous for democracy. AK is neither a qualified judge nor Saint. So if one person thinks his views are always rights it's quite dangerous. My question to Ashutosh, why there is no Lokapal in Delhi? Why Tomar was not asked to step aside earlier until the investigation was complete? Now it has proved that his degree was fake, will you still defend him and cry that police I'll treated him?

"History is cruel and ruthless, but it is neutral. Most of the time it does not side with the vanquished, but victors are not spared either.

You were scared that your hypocrisy will be exposed once the truth comes out. In spite of being an AAP supported I am extremely happy that police and LG did what they did. We cannot trust you people anymore. You are just like any other politician protecting your clan, no matter how severe the crime is. People who questioned you on this, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, were thrown out. Lokpal was thrown out. Will you care to tell us that what exactly is the difference between AAP and Congress and BJP? You are sliding down the drain faster than any other political party.

                            Let me tell you first that I am not BJP or other party blind supporter. I think, Ashutosh and Aam Aadmi Party is just trying to be aggressive. If AAP really want to work in genuine way then they can just bypass these all things, even if there is any conspiracy against AAP. They just want to remain in news by throwing things to others. This is just re-characterization of Congress. I think if they promise 100 things, I understand they cannot achieve all 100 things without center support, but they should at least try for 40-60% in genuine way. And I understand Public can understand their genuine character.<br/><br/>
Even sometimes I think people like Ashutosh never tired..how they manage to speak speak speak for all day with great energy. So lets not waste energy by doing this all. <br/><br/>
So stop doing this all and just focus on work. Rest you can trust on public for reward/punishment, because it is not always easy to make foolish public, specially in 2nd time.

                            Ashutosh, first stop blabbering in blogs and come for constructive debates. There is no point vomiting in your own blog which prevents others from asking questions. Tell me something. You and your party claimed that you were common men. So why moan about midnight arrest? All common men are arrested only in the night. Also, if it's done in the daylight, your CEO will stage road protest. Next, you and your CEO always point the fingers at Modi. Now what? Even the court has agreed for his custody. Go, clean up your mess and then start blabbering in the blogs.

                            Never ever in History of post-independence India we have seen police becoming so proactive. Proactive is the wrong word - hyper enthusiastic. Its so clear how the corrupts get together to wage a war against AAP. Mr. Tomar may have fake degree but he has not committed a murder that police want him get arrested with bail. If we see the last 20 years in New Delhi - we can recollect way too many incidents of rape, murder, crime done by politicians but both police and bureaucracy kept and mum and didn't move a feet to arrest them - and now see what's happening. Doesn't matter what you may do we don't let you come to power again BJP+Congress.

                            Ashutosh, grow up, show some maturity and also some honesty which you seem to be lacking. Here is a man, who has clearly forged documents to become a minister, cheating the population of Delhi. The least AAP should have done is to distance the party from the culprit and waited for the outcome of the investigation before throwing its weight behind tomar. Instead you have the brazenness to blame the BJP and the police for your crimes!!<br/>
By standing by such culprits, you are exposing your selves as no different from the lallus of the indian political system ..Disgusting!!

You are in government similar to other 28 states. If Delhi is victimized, it will be known to people, and election will reflect it. But what about your say for internal Lokpal. Why Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan shacked. Perhaps they were not fit to hide the wrongdoings ?   Come on... Do some good work people will acknowledge it, appreciate it.

Why launch Internal Lokpal now when AAP and your team already had insight from High Court case and Universities? Is Modi to be blamed for AAP Minister's marital problems, Delhi Garbage , unacceptable behavior with public servants, media ordinances? <br/>
Emergency or Crying Wolf? Are you reaching to people without due diligence? Didn't people gave you mandate based on AAP's commitment to probity within itself also? Is inability to govern the main issue?

Please accept your mistakes in choosing Mr.Tomar and other such candidates. Matter is over. Even after getting exposed, AAP is living in fool's paradise. Time for putting in place system to screen people and flow of funds instead of blaming Modi for everything. I suppose, AAP is missing the values of YY, PB, Ramdoss and Professor.

Why AAP always point finger to PM?

Come out of modifobia and don't create bad image of our PM just for your cheap publicity....If you have a proof, go to court or just keep your mouth shut...Don't tarnish image of our country by everyday allegation...<br/><br/>

If you can't govern a municipality you better quit and go back to your dharna politics. Pity people of Delhi for electing a bunch of morons to govern them.

                            all this that you say about Modi can easily be applied to Kejriwal. He is so power hungry that he left Delhi hoping to become the PM. when he lost, he begged for this seat again. When he got this seat, he kicked out PB and YP just to show them who the boss is. He did not address their concerns. He did not try to fix what is wrong. His idea of solving a problem is to kick the whistle-blowers out.<br/><br/>

                            Dear Asthosh,<br/><br/>
it is true that whatever the degree your ex law minister had got fake, why you Blame others ? AAP came to clean the politics but with 67 MLA almost three MLA are in trouble- 1.Tomar for 420 2.Bharthi-For domestic violence 3. gajendra sing- Fake degree and some of your leaders are rapist so there is no difference from other party.<br/>
Before coming to Gujarat , I was posted in Delhi for 3 years, the difference between Gujarat and Delhi as follow<br/>
1.I have experienced no power cut in Gujarat like Delhi<br/>
2.I have experienced ladies can travel at any time any where with out any fear as Ladies are given much much respect in Gujarat than Delhi<br/>
3.Roads are fantastic and no frustrated travelers found in  Gujarat like Delhi<br/>
4.I do not have any fear to give lift any ladies or gents in my car in Gujarat where as In delhi lot of friends warned me to give such a lift-<br/>
5.Corruption is rampant in Delhi but in Gujarat it is invisible in my case I got back deposit from Gujarat government very easily but changing RC in my name for my car in delhi took more than year bu till half done<br/>
Even though I am sympathizer of congress( never voted for any party) but BJP has done some good work in Gujarat as I compare the situation in the year 1996-97 with present situation<br/>
Before analyzing the situation in Ground level by writing will not helpful and final question why you want expel tomar from party now  ? why not earlier ?will APP give  back all his donated funds to Tomar ? Tomar fund was acceptable but his 420  action is not acceptable to AAP . so you also a normal party and all double standards.

I was expecting that Ashutosh or Ak or any other AAP leader would have told that Law will do it's work and if proved the minister will be expelled. After writing all this rubbish, AAP even though agreed to expel TOmar it is too late.

                            Sorry Ashutosh, I am not a  Congress or BJP supporter, but firmly I believe you people are more dangerous than Terrorist and even equal to the new breading terrorist  group called ISIS. They are killing the innocent people in the name of religion but this AAPtrads will kill the future of this country's innocent new  generations in the pretext of "Anti corruption Crusaders".Thanks to many of our double standard media in the country for their fake journalism.

                            Do you get your articles approved by AK first? The way you write and reasons you give will get yourself too expelled soon. You are defending a person whom your party is going to expel.

                            Mr.Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
the yellow journalist turned politician. stop cribbing and start working to deliver the promise made to the people of Delhi.<br/>
 since coming in to power, you have done nothing worth mentioning. every day you come on prime time channels to hog the limelight and defend the biggest Joke of the 21st Century Arvind Kejriwal.<br/><br/>
please grow up and start acting like a adult and honest person

                            Sorry. We dont believe AAP any more. Please tell kejriwal that every one now knows he is farce,  he should resign and  dismantle this farce of AAP. The AAP serial is going on too long, people of Delhi must be morons to elect a dangerous clown like Kejriwal. Please spare us all, particularly Delhi.

                            Come on Ashutosh!  I am so disappointed in you.  AAP with all its promises to change the political landscape will be held to the highest standards.  If the party includes criminal minded people as part of its govt, then there goes the dream of cleaning up politics.<br/><br/>
Be brave and face upto the challenge.  Weed out all those in AAP who are criminals or have done illegitimate things - make AAP squeaky clean.  If you don't clean your dirty laundry, someone else will and this is the kind of black eye you will get.

                            Just why NDTV is giving space to this moron who can barely string a sentence together beats me!  This character actually thinks that Modi is spending every waking hour thinking of ways to bring down these minor characters!  Apart from the Bihari slum dwellers who were promised freebies that were simply not deliverable, nobody could give a damn about this bunch of losers!  They will drown in a sewer of their own making and a good thing too!

                            Ashutosh, please read Gita. Krishna says that it is victor who writes history. By the way, where is Ashish Khaitan? No where to be seen to defend Tomar.
