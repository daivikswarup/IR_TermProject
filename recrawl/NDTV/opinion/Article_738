Headline::::How Congress Will Block GST



DateTime::::2015-08-04T14:13:00+05:30




                                Arun Jaitley's Facebook post on Congress and the GST is wrong on every count. He begins by bemoaning the fact that while the GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a Congress initiative, it is now the Congress that is blocking progress. What he forgets to add is that it is the BJP, led in this instance by none other than Jaitley himself, who blocked the passage of the 2011 GST Bill presented by then Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, principally because Gujarat, under a Chief Minister called Narendra Modi, was dead opposed to it. It is thus richly ironic that the man who taught us how to block matters is now bemoaning how well we have learned from him to do so. 
The difference is that while Modi and Jaitley blocked without reason (for, if there were reason, how have they now suddenly become such ardent advocates of exactly what they blocked?!) the Congress has presented cogent reasons - of a general and specific nature - for its stand in the long dissent Note it has incorporated into the Report of the Select Committee on Jaitley's GST Bill. 
As Jaitley makes no reference to the general reasons advanced by the Congress (for that would be to nakedly reveal his own absence of reason), let this column bring on record the principle general reason. Our Note of Dissent begins by saying that while we are in favour of a "simple and comprehensive GST" the present Bill is neither simple nor comprehensive. It is not "simple" because it is pitted with so many exceptions, exemptions and compromises as to obscure the overarching purpose for which the Congress has been campaigning for a GST for more than a decade, namely, to jack up our growth rate by making India a single common market where, whether a product is sold in Bulandshahar or Basavangudi, the sales tax levied on it is the same everywhere. This can only happen if every good and every service, without exception, comes within the ambit of the Bill. Hence our emphasis on the next two words: "and comprehensive". If electricity and most petroleum products are kept out of the Bill's purview, as Jaitley has proposed, obviously a huge input in the production of every type of good and service will be excluded. It is impossible to think of almost any product (except perhaps handlooms and handicrafts) that do not require electricity and petroleum products. Yet, Jaitley's Bill does just that. 
Secondly, alcohol for human consumption is one of the most revenue-generating items produced. Yet, the liquor industry is riddled with malpractices because high taxes on liquor only open the door to 'hooch' and what is technically called 'seconds' - liquor that is siphoned out of sight of the taxwallah and sold in the black market. This has not only spelt a painful, writhing death for thousands caught in the web of illicit liquor, it has also spawned a vast mafia involved in all kinds of criminal activity. Therefore, including liquor and tobacco in the GST is an imperative of rendering the GST "comprehensive". Jaitley's Bill fails on that score.
Next, Jaitley admits that the Congress proposal to provide for an 18 per cent ceiling on GST has merit. Yet, he wants to leave it to the GST Council - a collection of State Finance Ministers - to decide the rate. As the rate being bruited about (on a calculation made by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy) is 27 per cent or even higher, there is naturally concern that in chasing higher revenues - which is arguably the chief concern of Finance Ministers - the temptation will be to take the GST as high as possible. That is why a Constitutional mandate to keep the rate moderate and reasonable was being attempted through the Congress amendment to provide a ceiling of 18 per cent beyond which the GST Council would not be authorized to go. 
Note that any indirect tax, including GST, is "regressive" - that is, it falls most on the poorest consumer. With direct taxes in the region of 30-33 per cent, an indirect tax like GST at 27 percent would be a huge burden for the poor to bear, the burden being the greater the poorer the consumer. 
Jaitley's colleagues in the Select Committee took recourse to the argument that a specific figure or percentage cannot be mentioned in the Constitution. We patiently pointed them to the precedent that the Constitution in Article 276 (2) sets a ceiling in absolute numbers - "two thousand and five hundred rupees per annum" - on professional taxes; so there was no problem in mentioning a specific percentage as the ceiling for GST. The argument did not wash with the BJP. We then pointed out that they themselves, in this very Bill, were proposing an additional levy of 1 per cent. If it was valid, we said, to propose a specific percentage in one part of the Bill, how was it illegitimate to propose a specific percentage in another part of the same Bill? Answer there was none because in the smug arrogance of its majority in the Lok Sabha, the BJP has closed its ears to straightforward logic.
With regard to the BJP proposal to levy an additional 1 per cent tax for two years, we pointed out that this would be market-distorting besides being wholly unnecessary if our proposal were accepted that for a period not less than five years, the Centre should fully compensate any revenue loss suffered by any state. But Jaitley's boys (and now, it would seem, Jaitley himself) were having no truck with any Congress amendment. Well, we will have to teach the Jaitley gang that in our parliamentary system a simple majority in the Lok Sabha is not enough to bulldoze their view; our strength in the Rajya Sabha exceeds theirs and they have to secure a two-thirds majority in each House, with half the members present and voting, to secure passage of a Constitution amendment Bill such as the 2015 GST Constitution amendment Bill. Congress members of the Select Committee constituted one-seventh of the strength of the Committee; our strength is nearly double that in the Rajya Sabha. With the help of just those three other parties (CPI-M, CPI and AIADMK) who submitted Notes of Dissent, we will have the required blocking one-third of the vote. Jaitley needs to redo his arithmetic.
The 2011 Mukherjee Bill that Jaitley, a new convert, has suddenly started quoting when it suits his convenience, provided that there would be a GST Disputes Settlement Authority. Jaitley's merry band have decided that the GST Council will itself settle all disputes - which is a blatant transgression of the elementary judicial principal that a party to a dispute cannot be a judge in its own cause. Since all GST disputes must necessarily involve one or more states and often the Centre, how can a GST Council composed of the states and the Centre decide for or against its own membership? Hence, Finance Minister Mukherjee had provided for a GST Disputes Settlement Authority. We tried to bring this back into the Jaitley Bill. Jaitley conveniently elides this question.
We also moved that the Centre be prevented from bullying the states by raising the share of the States' votes from two-thirds to three-quarters. The BJP revealed its true face by insisting that the Centre retain a blocking one-third of the total vote. What kind of "cooperative federalism" is this that does not trust the states to know what is good for them and, therefore, to retain the power to ride roughshod over the States' collective majority? 
This mentality of bullying the weak and helpless is evident in Jaitley's opposition to the pathetic plea of two small entities - Puducherry and Goa - for the GST Council to extend "special consideration" to their requirements. The BJP chairman of the Select Committee rejected this on the specious plea that only "special status" States could have this concession; he was deaf to our argument that "special consideration" did not require states being given "special status". The same woodenness characterized the BJP's inability to understand that one cannot talk of "supplies" - which is at the heart of the Bill - without defining what the word means. 
And, finally Jaitley's insensitivity to the interests of local government, whose "sound finances" - a Constitutional requirement - are in danger of being seriously undermined by the Bill, is part of the same mindset. We asked for no more than that the "principle" of local bodies receiving an equitable share in any revenue buoyancy be discussed in the GST Council. This was rejected. Jaitley points to the State Finance Commissions as the appropriate forum for such discussion, but flinches from accepting that unlike central Finance Commission recommendations that, by convention, are accepted and acted upon, most State Finance Commission recommendations are gathering dust in mouldy cupboards. Inclusion of this point in the GST Constitution amendment would strengthen not weaken the 73rd amendment which assures the "sound finances" of the Panchayats. 
We are not in a mood to oblige Jaitley. He can eat his heart out.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The only agenda why Congress is blocking GST, Land Bill and other such bills is because they are better than what the Congress had prepared. These better bills will ensure there's growth and development by the time next elections are round the corner. In absence of good legislation, growth will take a back seat and that might hamper the electoral wins of BJP. What is shocking is that the blocking game that BJP did was in Lok Sabha where people stand in election, win the mandate of the people and are elected. Congress is doing all this through Rajya Sabha where no one is elected. In Rajya Sabha people like Mani Shankar Aiyar and other chamcahs are nominated based on quota of state govts. Now it's like that the nominated chamchas who lost the election or hadn't the guts to stand in elections are blocking legislation proposed by the elected members of the people of the country. Shame on you Congress by being such a big nuisance to the country. We are better off without Sonia, Rahul and their band of chamchas like Mani Aiyar, Diggy Raja, Salman Khursid, Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal. We are fed up of you arse holes. Do you read this, jokers ?

                            If a biscuit packet costs Rs 10 uniformly all over India, the poor might be able to buy it. But if it costs Rs 25, very few poor people would be able to afford it. That is what Mani is saying here. BJP wants to make life difficult for you to fill in its coffers. But block-headed bhakts will not understand this.

                            Indian truck's daily average is just above 200 KM where as world average is 400 KM. This is not due to road condition but due to interstate talls and endless queues. Need to grow as an integrated federal system and go for GST eliminating interstate checkposts..... One way of look at GST.<br/><br/>
By saying you will block GST at all will, it proves beyond a doubt why you have not seen the doors of parliament this time and wont be anytime more. Good Luck !!

                            All I can say is Mr Iyer's article is completely misleading. Here are my reasons for it. <br/>
His first argument is how the tax rates are high and how its going to affect the poors and how the rates should be capped at 18%. My take is, its really a frivolous expectation to mention rates in the constitutional amendment. The tax rates are supposed to be dynamic to ensure they could be changed based upon economic reality of the day. The bill empowers the committee of states to change the rates with 2/3 majority at any point in time. He really can't expect the government to fix rates in the constitutional amendment so that every time we need a change to the rate a constitutional amendment is required. Thats simply ludicrous.<br/>
His second argument is about 1% surcharge on petroleum products distorts the free market. Notwithstanding the fact that subsidies instituted by congress governments actually distorted the market for last 60 years. In reality,<br/>
the states want 1% petrol surcharge because a major portion of the state revenue comes from charging petroleum products and they don't want to let that go till the GST stabilises and brings in equivalent amount of revenue. Fear of revenue loss was the main reason why most of the states were opposing congress version of GST. Mr. Jaitley managed to build consensus by putting this in. It seems the Congress cleverly wants to dismantle the consensus by insisting for this change.<br/><br/>
Then he raises the bogey of of 27% indirect tax on top of direct tax being at 33%.I find this really a stretched argument. Only 4% of Indians pay direct tax and India has around 30-50% poor people so thats out of the window. Besides, 33% is the tax slab for the people above 10 lakh income. In which world they are considered to be poor? In reality effective tax rate after deducting the deduction even on rich indians is 22%. If Mr. Iyer is paying the taxes at 33% he needs to get a better CA.<br/><br/>
Finally, what he is not mentioning is for many of the products we pay around 30% (if you consider both central and state) of sales tax on the final price that is going to come down to 27%. I guess reducing prices is never going to be part of congresses agenda whether they are in power or opposition. I personally find it appalling that major tax reform that unifies india into a single market is being stalled for petty politics.

                            I for one am happy to see that Mr. Aiyar has spoken sense. The GST in the proposed form is not worthy enough to be enacted. The exemption of any commodity from the GST would create imbalance between states for one. Additionally, as rightly pointed out, the exclusion of petroleum products and electricity from GST would lead to artificial price wars of the same product between states, which is not desirable and does not make economic sense. The Central Government has to take the step forward of convincing the state governments to accept the uniformity and comprehensive clauses.

As Manmohan Singh quoted, "No one can stop an idea whose time has come". With this sort of an anti national mindset, the Congress will get less than 44 seats next time, and may even be derecognised. Rich desserts for a party that puts the interests of a single discredited family above that of the nation. Would any other party have nominated a moron like Aiyer to the Rajya Sabha?

                            It was NDA1 which first mooted GST. The draft which UPA presented which Mani boasts off was made possible by the hardwork of Sushil Modi, who was the Chairman of the committee of FInance Ministers. The draft did not move an inch because of the intransigence of some of the states, perhaps incl. BJP ruled states. So what Jaitley has done is to leave out a few contentious clauses for later and have a bill which atleast substantially covers the products and goods that are normally traded. Now Congress through its worst specimen Mani, shows its true colours by wanting to block the bill. Bravo!! what a noble achievement!

                            The logic presented here is false. If the bill was presented by Congress and opposed by BJP during UPA government, the Congress should use its passage to show the nation that BJP doesn't have any original ideas and they are advancing our legislations.  The only trick that does not work with Congress making such pitch to the people is because all the mess that have created during UPA, people don't believe them and don't think Congress has any ideas that works well for the nation.  Instead of bashing the BJP, Congress leader should do manthan (since such practice is advocated by their leaders) and be responsible opposition.  If too much to deliver,  another practice of their leader is to hide in some secluded region of the country or the world.

                            Mani, Keep doing it. It will eventually turn out to be good for the country because you and your party will be blocked for ever. The son of your leader whom you consider as gift of God and reincarnation of your leader who is no more will never become the PM of the country. And thank God for that. One of the family got to become the PM due to quirk of the fate that supported by sycophants like you put him in PM's chair. The other one is now desperate but will never succeed because he has been thoroughly exposed as a hollow and brainless individual. Not long before you were roaring and going to open a chai stall for someone who you hate with all the venom and the country made you and your benefactor family bite the dust from which they including you are still chocking and gasping for breath. We want congress to continue to do what it is doing and we are happy that you are helping your party to write its obituary. Excellent and thank you.

                            @AAPHole: Wish you had read the entire article of Mani. Certainly it would have made you knowledgeable what GST is all about. Also note, going by Mani's arguments, BJP's GST is far removed from the original idea of making India a single market for all services and goods. That's enabling you to buy toothpaste, soap, petrol, medicine, etc at the same price anywhere in India.

This fellow is lying when he says opposition was against GST when Congress was in power. They had specific inputs to discuss which Congress will not disclose due to their hate of Modi. Alcohol, Petro products not being included is all because of congress CM's as much as other parties CM's. Ask your CM's to accept GST totally and then talk Mr.Aiyar.<br/><br/>
And yes, this article basically says Congress will not allow development of the country because we are out of power. So in effect, Congress is punishing people for not voting for them. So much for democracy!

                            Lets face it... MSI has valid points mentioned in the article above. I am an avid reader of articles by NDTV pundits from both sides (cong vs bjp) and I try to use my head to understand what they want to say. Most of the people on this forum hardly read the first couple of lines and started commenting on MSI and the kind of tongue that he has. Lets leave MSI aside and assume someone else has written this. Then think, are the points valid. In this case, I think most of the cases are valid. I personally feel that we should block these kinds of constitution amendments. Overall, my personal feeling is that we are too optimistic about getting this bill passed. Come 2025 and we will still be debating on this bill. Its best we park it aside for 10 years and work towards make smaller changes in the taxation system so that 10 years from now, when we introduce GST, most people will accept it the way it is introduced. All states and the Center have vested interests and hence, such a big change is nothing but a herculean task to achieve. <br/><br/>
I am no finance guru and to me, the biggest priority of the government is to increase the tax exemption limit drastically and put in strict measures to force the business community to pay tax. Its easy to understand that I am a salaried citizen of the country with friends in the business community who earn and spend 10X more than I do and pay 10% of tax than what I do. Again, I know we cannot ensure 100% compliance, but even some % increase in the tax umbrella will be a big boost for the country. <br/><br/>

                            I am always surprised you know, despite the Golden rule by the Family for 65 years, still the sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi says they are fighting for the poors who does not get a square mill or sometimes remains hungry. Now each such family rulers has zamindars who generally lies and never tells the truth. I have few questions for Mr Iyer:<br/>
a. What the Family has done for last 65 years that 40% of people are still below poverty line and for whom Rahul Gandhi is promised his life.<br/>
b. What education and information has been administered by the Family into the society that communalism has become order of the day. Why the population is so sensitive to communalism.<br/>
c. Why the orality of the nation has gone down so low that the corruption has become order of the day.<br/>
d. Why the family turned our defence in to a junkyard of obsolete arms<br/>
Dear Mr Iyer your family has played violin when the nation was in flame, burning with hunger, illiteracy and poverty. For past 65 years this family has turned into animals. We are corrupt, we are communal and whats more we hate each other, exactly what you wanted us to be so that the Gandhi family can rule us. So much is the hatred of the family for the poor people of India that they mock poor tea vendors, waitresses, rickshawalas, house maids. How can they be administrators? Because they are poor so they are sub humans. They deliberately let the remain society communally sensitive because so long there will be riots and bloodshed the family will be safe. This is the reason that the historic PEACE accord NAGAS has been mocked and booed by the Family. Tell me which country uses Military against its own people. Similar case was at Jharkhand, Bihar and MP etc states struggling with Naxalites.You did nothing for them. Those adivasis are so poor that any of them even do not have clothes to wear, even after 65 years of golden rule by your family. People like you have totally ruined the nation and it has no future any more. I would urge the nation to look behind and judge.

Jaitly did mention that it is the same bill that Congress had tabled but did not mention why they blocked it for more than 6 years. I am sure BJP had a good reason for that. And if it is not the same bill then it is prudent to discuss and iron out the maladies that may exist just like their land reform bill where BJP wanted to bring in or exclude certain clauses to benefit certain classes. BJP's own allies have said it repeatedly and opposed the bill.

The opposition by Modi, as well as CMs of many states, were based on the question of compensation for loss of revenue. The centre has accepted that it will compensate for 5 years. While a cap of 18% sounds  good, it has to be seen what will be the real impact as GST has a cascading structure, with deductions on inputs. It will bring many, who are avoiding tax today, within the tax regime but the net effect is complex. The proposal that the GST council decides the rate is logical. The fact is a good law has been held up due to the Congress practicising blackmail tactics &amp; not on the basis of national interest.

                            This shows the intention of the Congress Party similar to what they had mentioned about the Parliament Session which they had predicted to be a complete washout......

                            Wonder  why such a knowledgeable felon is ignored  even by his own party  and patronized only by some TV channels.Deserves better now that it is becoming certain that he after his present term expires would never be able to enter Parliament  except as an ex-member.

                            Its most interesting to read the vitriol from the 'Bakths' when it comes to 'defending' their party.  'isms' and 'utvas' aside and look at issues dispassionately, we could all contribute to better legislation and rapid social development in India. For instance, lets take this article by Mani - if one takes time to read through this article, there are a number of points that he has raised which are food for thought. I will pick up just one of the points so that my fellow readers can consider matters more objectively:<br/>
Selective exemption of GST on certain items does not make for a uniform tax code for indirect taxes. Take for instance the exemption of Liquor/ Tobacco:<br/>
Indian alcohol (for human consumption) market is approx 35 Bln US$. 12 Bln comes from the Organised sector and 22 .5 Bln is owned by the 'country liquor' segment. At 18% GST, that would be approx 6 Bln in tax revenue to the government while @27% (as proposed by Jaitley) that would mean 9 Bln in revenue - that's more than our total arms purchase from the USA in the last 10 years (which includes 12 C-130J Hercules, 8 P8I maritime reconnaisance aircrafts and 10 C17 globemaster III gigantic airlift aircrafts) Add 1 Bln to the 9Bln lost GST and we could buy all of the above military equipments once more and ALSO buy 22 Apache attack helicopters and 15 Chinooks.<br/><br/>
Now about tobacco - indian market size for tobacco is 245 Bln USD and growing at 11% CAGR. That would be approx 44 Bln in GST from Cigarettes, Bidis and Gutkas. <br/>
Considering the fact that alcohol and tobacco does not exactly contribute to social development, it is probably worthwhile for the government to review the feedback provided by the Congress and others........FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF US, INDIANS. Let our leaders keep aside the interests of the financial contributors to their election fund and instead look after the interests of every indian when they draft and table legislations!

                            You BJP blocked this vital bill when you were in opposition because Modi, your boss, told you to. Now we,Congress, will block GST because our boss, Rahul, told us to. When are our political parties going to stop playing petty politics and thing about the nation.
