Headline::::Slogans vs Reality: 12 Simple Facts on Modiji's 12 Months



DateTime::::2015-05-27T04:49:00+05:30




                                The media is full of anniversary retrospectives, and since I've been early off the starting gate with my own assessment of the Prime Minister and his regime (as far back as December 2014), I am reluctant to repeat myself in mellifluous analytical prose all over again. Since my point of view is well-known already, I would prefer not to belabour my readers with further commentary. Instead, here is a simple recital of bare facts - one for each of Mr Modi's months in office to date, juxtaposed with the related Moditva slogan:
 
Slogan: "India First".Reality: The Prime Minister has delivered more speeches in Parliaments abroad, than in the Lok Sabha of which he is a member.
 

Slogan: "No more tax terrorism".Reality: The government inflicted tax demands on entire new categories of victims, shaking investor confidence. Foreign funds have withdrawn $550 million from India in the first half of May alone, a dubious record.
 

Slogan: "Responsible government".Reality: Despite draconian measures and targets, the Government missed the revised tax collection target for both direct and indirect taxes by Rs. 2,288 crore in the financial year 2014-15.
 

Slogan: "Make in India".Reality: Manufacturing rate of growth under UPA, May 2014: 5.6%. Manufacturing rate of growth under NDA, April 2015: 2.1%.
 

Slogan: "We will create jobs for our youth."Reality: Number of Indians entering the job market each month: 10 lakh. Number of new jobs created by UPA April-June 2014: 1.82 lakh. Number of new jobs created by Modi government October-December 2014: 1.17 lakh.
 

Slogan: "Indian businesses will thrive."Reality: India's merchandise exports shrank for the fifth consecutive month in April. Merchandise exports last month were 14% lower than the $25.6 billion in April last year, and imports fell 7.5% to $33 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $11 billion, according to commerce ministry data.
 

Slogan: "We will build India."Reality: The total value of tenders issued in 2014-15 (across infrastructure sectors) stood at Rs. 395,300 crore, a 23 per cent decline from the previous year under UPA. The problem of weak tendering affected railways, highways, real estate, water supply and the irrigation sector.
 

Slogan: "We will build roads that UPA couldn't."Reality: The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) got a budgetary allocation of only Rs. 14,291 crore for 2015-16. According to the Ministry of Rural Development, the state governments require Rs. 57,206 crore just to complete pending road-building projects already sanctioned. The budget won't cover a quarter of that, let alone new roads.
 

Slogan: "Jan Suraksha".Reality: Social-sector spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen to its lowest levels since 2010 - and that's not even taking into account five years of inflation since then. Budgets for health, education, sanitation and women's security - all major talking points of the BJP's election campaign - have been savagely slashed. Central schemes remain on paper but are now unfunded or grossly underfunded.
 

Slogan: "Jan Dhan Yojana".Reality: 60% of the new Jan Dhan Yojana accounts have zero balance.
 

Slogan: "Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas".Reality: India's minorities are daily being made to feel unwelcome by the majoritarian discourse flourishing under the BJP, with ruling party MPs, including two Ministers, uttering Hindu-chauvinist sentiments never heard before from people in authority. Ghar wapasi, saffronization, statues of Godse, Ramzadein and Haramzadein, have all entered into and seared our political discourse, while the Prime Minister has remained ostentatiously silent, refusing to discipline or dismiss his errant ministers.
 

Slogan: "Our coal auctions made record sums of money."Reality: These are projections of what auctioned coal mines would make over thirty years of full and successful production. It takes a level of chutzpah that only Mr Modi is capable of to claim credit in 2015 for accomplishments that won't actually occur till 2045.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own facts. These are incontrovertible facts; the glowing polls being cited by Mr Modi's supporters are opinions. At this rate, the facts will continue to speak for themselves in the only poll that matters - the one that's coming in 2019.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Tharoor says it as it is. Plain and simple. Now only if there was an aptitude for a grown up public discourse among the masses instead of the juevenile name calling and abuse throwing that one normally finds most people take pleasure in indulging.

                            I think every party tries to take advantage of twisted projections regarding money allocations for schemes/project, job creation, performance of economy, etc etc. But I fail to understand why govt's don't make public the way they arrived at the result/decisions/projections. If the govt is taking credit for something that far in future shouldn't there be a governing body to ensure that realistic figures/perceptions are put in front of the public then mere eye wash projections in the name of creating positive vibe of the country's economy.<br/><br/>
I repeat every party does that...Cheers

                            Perhaps, somewhere Shashi Tharoor speaks the truth, though his highlight of UPA government was doing better, which is a BITTER TRUTH. Last 10 yrs UPA rule devastated our country, how come a learned man like Shashi comments like this, merely b'cos he is part of UPA.  Is he trying to make the people FOOLS who read his blogs?  However, his writing brings some of the truths, as Modi could have concentrated on many bleeding issues and could have brought reprieve to the society, rather he is busy in so many other things.  One can understand, one year is too short of a time, however, foundation need to be strong. The Indian people saved our country this time by giving a chance to NDA, rather electing UPA again, who could have ensured our country might hv gone into goons hands.  I said this with the mere fact LEADERSHIP is missing in UPA, or someone has Leadership is not able to come forward to take the reign. An uneducated lady like sonia, or her son with no background will be able to run this country to prosperity? It's a mere dream.Request Modi and team must come to REALITY, and start working from there if he wanted to serve the people of India.  We have hope on Modi, who may not betray us.Several things need changes...pl look into.

Unfortunately, Modi's one year has gone by in ensuring the best relationships across the world...he was just out for 50 days out of total 365 days, attended more days in Session than Rahul Gandhi &amp; Sonia combined, still he's been scrutinize for every action.  <br/><br/>
Has anyone been to Amethi/Rae Bareli, the deplorable condition under which the people are staying, I belong to Amethi and tell you for a fact in this summer only 8-10hrs. of electricity is available.  Rahul has not even work on the Food processing plant for good 04 years &amp; now started blabbering after LONG SLEEP...Shashi wont dare to comment, his Wife's murder mystery, his work in Kerala was heavily criticized ALL FACTS AVAILABLE on internet...check yourself to validate

                            Mr Shashi Tharoor you are showing all the statistics are wrong may be some are true regarding modis speech etc but reality under NDA only india had maximum economical growth just for example. I will take the GDP growth you are proudly saying under vajpayee govt the GDP growth was 4.8%when they came to power but when they left the power to UPA it was 8.4% no a net average of about 6% growth during the tenture statistically the average may seem to be less but actually the real growth of indian economy was started by vajpayee govt not your manmohan govt..but when your UPA CAME IT WAS 8.4% while leaving your power it was just 4.8% that is you are reached back to the stage where vajpayee started the economic growth yes you are right the average GDP WAS 7.9 in your time but your government has taken it backwards to pre vajpayee era...this MODI GOVERNMENT have to face a higher CAD, fiscal deficit, high inflation, weak currency, stagnant infrastructure and manufacturing sector. Did the UPA I faced the same when they resumed power in 2004?<br/>
So the MODI government have to face lot of issues which UPA I did not faced. (But NDA faced in 1998, if you remember India also had US sanction in 1998)... If I start to counter all the stupid gimmick you wrote to make false claim as your govt achievement won't work Mr Tharoor it may work on some superficial papu bhakth but the neutral people who are close watching the actions of govt can't be fooled by your fake arguments.... Every data you are showing will deflect bad on NDA just because it is your government destroyed the indian economy like this...and for those are banding everyone as bhakth are actually the real bhakth but of congress...

                            Surprised to see congress hasn't changed. India now wants pro development policies instead of pro poverty policies. But apparently some Indians like Shashi and his boss Rahul, their Godmother Sonia and their poor Bhakts are still where India was 60years back. With so much criticism against Modi's foreign travel by congress Bhakts, when these travels have brought +$25 in investment commitments, I feel utterly sorry for the hopeless state of Kurta Pyjama wala Indian mentality. Poor Indians suffer because of some senseless fools like you.

Mr Modi is sowing the seed and it will take years for the seed to bear fruit. Why your government never thought of manufacturing weapons right here in India? You had 60 years to do that?

Better at making India Poorer than what it was! After all they have 60 years of better experience in how to have bad governance. The criticism by Shashi Tharoor is not constructive at all, I would have preferred to read what &amp; how it could have been done better than just fault finding.

                            Actually these observations carry very little weight.<br/>
1) How many speeches did Manmohan make? And the ones he did, bored everyone stiff. At least people listen to Modi, whether they agree or not.<br/>
2) Remember the retrospective tax on Vodofone that created the original mess?<br/>
3) Please specify draconian measures and steps. Tharoor appears to have personal issues with the measures to curb black money and money stashed abroad. That cannot be helped.<br/>
4) After 60 years of license permit raj it takes time to unshackle industry and show results. Remember Manmohan's release animal spirits remarks? But the economy is on the move sans the UPAs stench of all pervading corruption.<br/>
5) The difference between UPA and NDA is that the former wanted to increase employment by doling out government jobs, while the latter wants youth to be self employed. The Mudra Bank will be a game changer.<br/>
6) to 9) Mere statistics which neither prove nor disprove anything without analysing underlying causes.<br/>
10) Jan Dhan Yojana was meant to transfer government subsidies and other financial help directly to the poor. The purpose was to prevent exploitation of the poor.So what if there is zero balance now?<br/>
11) The PM has made his stand on this issue abundantly clear. In a democracy there are many voices, some of which may not be palatable. Learn to tolerate. Everyone has a right to his opinion. The PM will not rebuke his people publicly just to satisfy WOGs like Tharoor. <br/>
12) Only Tharoor would find fault with the coal and spectrum auctions which have been done transparently and generated vast revenue, even if spread over 30 years. Remember the devastating CAG comments which were proved right and the arrests and cases against UPA ministers in these exact same matters? Government auctions are not done like the IPL Kochi franchisee auctions. Right? No sweat equity you see.

Sorry I have no words to explain that situaton...

                            Lets see the facts.. there is no data on tender issued, dont know where from shashi got such data. manufacturing growth is down because of global situation. in any case capacity addition now will take some time to translate into production. whichever group u take in whichevwe sector they are expanding. fdi and fii both have increased which reflect that capacity expansion is happening. coal auction has made money in real terms not presumption. remember your govt threw away that coal at 0. social sector spending has reduced because more allocations is to states themselves. i am sure you know that all development activities like education, health are in state list under constitution. congress govt in last 60 years had concentrated the power on such spending by not devolving money to states. lastly i pity on all who are commenting. i hope we had more informed people. shashi has disappointed.. i still bwlieve he is one of the best brains around but he is defending indefensible and attacking uselessly. it makes me sad that he does not have integrity. loss to india..please comment of you have facts. i will ask you to first go through economic survey 2014-15 before that. government is achieving all targets which it had set ..

                            Mr Shashi Tharoor you are showing all the statistics are wrong may be some are true regarding modis speech etc but reality under NDA only india had maximum economical growth just for example. I will take the GDP growth you are proudly saying under vajpayee govt the GDP growth was 4.8%when they came to power but when they left the power to UPA it was 8.4% no a net average of about 6% growth during the tenture statistically the average may seem to be less but actually the real growth of indian economy was started by vajpayee govt not your manmohan govt..but when your UPA CAME IT WAS 8.4% while leaving your power it was just 4.8% that is you are reached back to the stage where vajpayee started the economic growth yes you are right the average GDP WAS 7.9 in your time but your government has taken it backwards to pre vajpayee era...this MODI GOVERNMENT have to face a higher CAD, fiscal deficit, high inflation, weak currency, stagnant infrastructure and manufacturing sector. Did the UPA I faced the same when they resumed power in 2004?<br/>
So the MODI government have to face lot of issues which UPA I did not faced. (But NDA faced in 1998, if you remember India also had US sanction in 1998)... If I start to counter all the stupid gimmick you wrote to make false claim as your govt achievement won't work Mr Tharoor it may work on some superficial papu bhakth but the neutral people who are close watching the actions of govt can't be fooled by your fake arguments.... Every data you are showing will deflect bad on NDA just because it is your government destroyed the indian economy like this...

                            These substantial sums will come, even if in a staggered manner. Not like UPA which gave mines and spectrum for almost nothing and pocketed huge sums. What is he complaining about?<br/><br/>
His Govt brought in retrospective tax. Now the demands have arisen out of a Court order based on the applications filed by the FIIs themselves. What do you expect the Govt to do? What is he complaining about?<br/><br/>
60 Years of his party's Govts have left India dirty, hungry, over populated, riven with divides, reputation of being corrupt, institutional decline and apathy (even of the PMs office) What is he complaining about?<br/><br/>
Such suave, sophisticated, well connected and seemingly decent people are even more dangerous than the rabid and uncouth anti Modi, anti BJP folks one sees. <br/><br/>
Our Country needs at least 20 years of non-congress and non-laloo, etc influenced rule to begin coming out of the dark shadows we have been pushed in by this fellows Party and others of their ilk. It is time for him and people like Mani Iyyer, etc to shut up OR bring some substantial thought to the table.

                            Dear Sri Tharoor, This is a tasteless and cheap blog to assessment of Modi Government's performance. It is not expected from an accomplished writer like you. 1. Slogan " make in India". The slogan is meant for long term plan and action for making India in manufacturing hub of goods. To assume that it is achievable in one year or short time span is childish.PM had never claimed or said it. 2. What is wrong if PM has visited many countries in order to redefine and strenthen realtions with other countries. When a new government is formed by former opposition party it is natural to redefine its foreign policies. 3.Selection of data to "prove" that NDA's performance is inferior is very selective just  to buttress your point of view.There are  data on many areas like power generation, mining, GDP, FDI inflows, Forex reserves, Sensex, ratings of India, inflation,etc.,  which supports strong performance of  Modi's government. But you deliberately ignored that data as it does's fit into and contradict your biased arguments.

                            I cannot expect you to write a neutral article. How can I? Did you ever write about mega scams when you were in power. If anyone has written commentary of your government then like you do now, you would not have lasted 10 years of misrule. Mr Sashi -- wait and watch instead of jumping on the government.

                            ofcourse some clever people could also give facts regarding how the number of scams by govt has gone down, how states and the centre can now have a better meaningful relationship, how armed forces have now started getting due attention, how long overdue public initiatives like 'swach bharat', cleaning of rivers, getting more foreign investments etc have been started by this govt. and if we started counting the money swindled and scammed by UPA and their treachery on india and its people at every level, well we'd be here all day. give it a rest shashi, they have only been here for 1 year. they will also make mistakes and then improve. their numbers at cherry picked categories which you quote so crisply above will get better in the days to come

                            Tax Terrorism: You quote about the funds in this regard. There is another way to look at it. Funds and Stock Markets are there for the FII's to make quick buck. If Indians demand tax rightfully they will go away. Shall we do away with all taxation? Why should India be a place for others to come and loot via mutual funds and stock market?

                            Please don't come to a conclusion with just two data points which is last year and this year. For Example: "Number of new jobs created by UPA April-June 2014: 1.82 lakh. Number of new jobs created by Modi government October-December 2014: 1.17 lakh." The statement above does not even consider the same time period for the comparison. April - June 2014 should be compared with April - June 2015, There might be a scenario that more jobs will be available for the month April - June. Also, you should consider other factors like seasonality (like a declining trend or an increasing trend). The above statements have flaws for which common people need to understand as an analyst.

                            The Congis as expected are cribbing everyday.<br/>
I wonder why does someone have to only look at stats for a 1 yr old govt.<br/>
Congress had spoken about eradicating poverty for several decades, were they able to do it ? What is their stats on that?<br/>
If 60% of a country depends on agriculture and that too mostly on rain god rather than good water preservation, it speaks volumes about what congress did in previous decades.<br/>
Rural population was left totally on their own with occasional slogans giving false hopes.<br/><br/>
If we see the way Modi functions, it seems to be high on rhetoric initially followed by some action. We do need both. If there is no talk people will not know anything like how it was during MMS govt. <br/>
MMS was mute through out and never spoke on any plans/policies clearly.<br/>
For eg: <br/>
1. Similar schemes like Jan Dhan existed in UPA regime, but did anyone paid attention to it ? <br/>
2. NPS was present during UPA, but did anyone knew advantages of that ?<br/>
3. Insurance schemes were present during UPA, but how many really enrolled into it ?<br/><br/>
So what is the use of having a scheme where no one knows it exists. Is it not the role of govt. to encourage its ppl to enroll into its schemes to make use of available benefit ?<br/><br/>
Coming to other stats like no job creation, investments etc., those will take time and they have to be reviewed after a couple of years. 2-5 years is no big time frame compared to congress rule of 60 yrs with pathetic record. In fact with the state of affairs due to congress rule, things may even take a decade to improve. <br/><br/>
On coal, spectrum auctions - we will at least get the money over a period of 30 yrs. Whereas during congress rule, it went straight to politicians and corporates. Nothing more to be said on that.<br/><br/>
Minority fears - It is there in the minds of congis and some section of media.<br/><br/>
Finally, On any day, I prefer a talkative, rhetorical Modi who will also do some action (even if it is not as big as he makes out), rather than Rahul baba who does not speak, does not act and even if he speaks, it is utter rubbish and vanishes from scene for months without trace.
