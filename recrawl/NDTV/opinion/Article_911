Headline::::What It's Like To Work With Prashant Kishor, Master Strategist



DateTime::::2015-11-12T19:18:00+05:30




                                For many experienced and qualified professionals who have a keen interest in politics but have to work in a corporate or other non-political set up, getting an opportunity to play a significant role in one of the most critical elections in India doesn't come easy. When the opportunity arrives, some manage to cast this interest aside, others take the plunge. We at Indian Political Action Committee or IPAC chose to do the latter.
It feels just like yesterday when my colleagues Rishi, Vinesh and I under the guidance of our mentor Prashant took up the mantle and perhaps one of the most exciting challenges of our lives - Bihar elections 2015. We landed in Patna in March 2015 - the team of three then has now grown to a team of 800+ spreading across districts, constituencies and villages. Indeed, the experience was overwhelming.
IPAC was set up with the motto to support deserving and good leaders for political offices. And a decision to work with the Sushasan Babu, Mr Nitish Kumar, for his election victory was indeed a reflection of that motto. Our overall strategy in Bihar was to set up a methodical, professional campaign driven by the notion of reasoning and not mere gut instincts. From the very beginning, our detailed focused group discussions with party representatives, designing of the campaign song, strategising campaign posters and more was driven by this very logic.
 
The campaign's central war room was set up in Patna with over 150 core team members divided into verticals such as field operations that included Swabhiman Raths, Cycle campaign (Har Ghar Nitishe, Har Man Nitishe), DNA Campaign, Outdoor and Media, Data and Telephony, Digital Promotions and Research & Communications. The team members worked on their key tasks, but the structure was fluid enough to ensure that everyone has an understanding of the overall campaign narrative and can learn and contribute across verticals at the same time.
 
The campaign started with the launch of our campaign slogan "Aage Badhta Rahe Bihar, Phir Ek Baar Nitish Kumar". Next came our campaign song and creative "Bihar Mein Bahar Ho, Nitish Kumar Ho" - the colors of the posters were chosen in order to ensure they stood out, hit the eye and reached the masses. Consecutively, a door-to-door campaign was launched by Mr Nitish Kumar himself called "Har Ghar Dastak" - the essence being "Ek Karyakarta Das Dastak, Ek Sandesh Har Ghar Tak''. The campaign didn't just involve karyakartas but also enthused them to take Nitishji's message of governance with justice to every household.  And then came our biggest hit, also the most attacking slogan of the campaign: "Jhanse Mein Na Aayenge, Nitish Ko Jitayenge."
 
Positive and attack campaigns were launched at various stages, all with an over-reaching narrative that none but Nitish Kumar for Bihar. Another narrative that was established at the very early stages of the campaign was ''Swabhiman'' - the assertion of Bihari self-respect in the light of the PM's comments attacking Nitish Kumar's DNA, calling Bihar BIMARU and its people ''Durbhagyashali''. What worked was also the synergy between the on-ground and online aspect of campaign execution. All this coupled with a clear communication of CM Nitish Kumar's vision for Bihar in the form of his 7 Nishchays or promises ensured that voters had all the ingredients necessary to take that final decision.
 
The execution of these campaigns on the ground was a huge task. About 800+ volunteers were activated across the state to carry out these campaigns and take our message to every door step. Members from the central core team were present in each assembly constituency to oversee the execution of the campaign, liaison with candidates, and build local level strategies if and when needed.
 
On polling day, constituency level war rooms were set up to connect with booth level agents and raise issues, if any, with election authorities.
 
The digital campaign also played a key component in multiplying the effect of our messages across online users - Facebook, WhatsApp and IVRS being the key tools where campaigns were customised to fit the demands of the technology and logic of each medium. Twitter was extensively used for Nitish Kumar's communication on a real-time basis, plus the #AskNitish campaign on Twitter and Facebook Q&A ensured the Chief Minister's connect with specific audiences and voters at large. Simultaneously, the success of each campaign was carefully measured on a daily basis with rigorous on-ground surveys and feedback systems.
 
Looking back, the last seven months have been the most demanding yet enriching experience for team IPAC. It is humbling to know that we worked on THE election campaign that perhaps holds the potential to change the political discourse of the country in years to come. And yes, we have got the break and rest that we needed, although withdrawal symptoms post elections have already begun to set in.(Pratik Jain is a Director at Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC).

                            WELL.. IN INDIA ITS VERY EASY TO ATTRACT VOTERS, EITHER BY VOWING CASTEISM, LANGUAGE, COMMUNAL OR BRIBING MONEY. THE PEOPLE ALWAYS FELL FOR ANY ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES. THIS COMPANY NEED NOT TO BE SO PROUD OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE... IF THEY ARE TRUE, THEY SHOULD BE THE FORCE OF ACTING AGAINST CORRUPT POLITICIANS RATHER THAN MAKING EXISTING STRATEGY IN A DIGITAL WAY TO MAKE MONEY... THIS IS JUST A MONEY MAKING IDEA..NOTHING ELSE, NO USE FOR COMMON MAN.

                            Good that you left Deloitte to play a "significant role" in nation's polity. Just know that you have helped Lalu Prasad Yadav's party emerge as the single largest party in Bihar and have helped orchestrate Lalu's comeback as the most significant player in Bihar's politics. I hope this feeling helps you with your withdrawal symptoms.

                            This character actually thinks that it was the campaign under the leadership of the 'mysterious' Prashant Kishore that won Nitish the election!  It wasn't!  It was the division of Biharis into caste based vote banks that won the election and the author of that division was none other than the veteran fraudster Lalu who, incidentally, is out on bail from a 5 year sentence for fraud! ''IPAC was set up with the motto to support deserving and good leaders for political offices.''  Is Lalu the convicted fraudster deserving and good?  Is the fact that Nitish collaborated with this fraudster 'deserving and good'?  Is the fact that the Congress party, responsible for some of the biggest scams in the world 'deserving and good'?  After all, Nitish also collaborated with this party!  No, Mr Jain, you may have convinced yourself that you ran a good, honest campaign and enabled an under siege Nitish to win the election.  The fact is that you and your organisation made no difference at all.  Not just that but the fraudulent claim that you have made made is exposed by that fact that  you did not project Lalu and yet he won more seats than your Nitish uncle!!!

                            Dont think its your ideology that made you support Nitish but for sure is the money... If you were si worried about your ideology, you would have left his camp stating Lalu's presence... So stop doing "dhong", enjoy your money and pray for the people of Bihar for what you have got them in to...

                            Well, there you have ladies and gentlemen, the real reason for the GA's victory and BJP's loss - advertising and marketing. And, we thought it was the development on the ground that Nitish did and the negative campaign by the BJP. If winning elections is all a matter of campaign then why not have Prashant Kishor running for PM in 2019? Campaigning is no doubt important but a minuscule part of the real deal. Full marks to Mr Kishor but the media should stop projecting that he alone turned the election on its head.

                            The ipac team is so Hardworking! They have worked 14 hours a day seven days a week and it's their hard work or we should say their excellence in planning strategies that made the GA win this election! Its the Bihar's mandate and i believe no one should question it. How can one say that the people in bihar are not aware of what is right and what wrong? Its the excellence of the ipac team that made the GA win this election and Nitish kumar is going to be the CM of bihar so I think one has no right to question that lalu will use them or such kind of kiddish questions. All the IPS IAS IFS are most from Bihar. These people are there in Patna since April so even they have families they also have their home! This is proffesionalism and if you talk about electing nitish and lalu as electing corrupt people Even you should know that these people campaigned for Narendra Modi in 2014 general elections. Were the Indian people fool?

                            For them it must have been an easy job considering the pallid performance of the central government-more on noise and less on work- in the last 1.5 years . Besides, snippets and tit bits of the beef, the cow and the dog also added leavening to the victory dough of the unassailable Grand Alliance

                            With all due respect to your background and credentials the 2 campaigns that your team has been in the news for looked like the candidate/party was already on their way to victory. BJP didn't have any real fight from a Congress led by Rahul , anti incumbency, failure of Manmohan Signh govt. Similarly Nitish has had a good run in Bihar doing good work, the vote math was in his favor with alliance he was able to put together. Hard to fathom what your team did. Will see if in 2017 your team can work with Congress in UP and show some magic. That would be a real test of "master strategist"

                            Congratulations on the massive exercise.<br/>
Having had mentioned your motto is to help deserving and good leaders to political offices, did you guys make a wrong calculation in working for Mr. Modi in the National elections? If YES, you are liable to be called short sighted and having mislead the masses. If NO, and would like to argue that both of the elections are at different levels, you can be accused of trying to be judgemental and assuming a sort of super human role for yourselves. Why don't you guys try to take the plunge and attempt a more sacred task?<br/><br/>

                            Well in a country like ours,  strategy may work to certain extent.You were with Modi ji and with Nithish ji and claimed grand success. Congratulations. I heard that Shri.Stalin of TamilNadu is going to take your  help. <br/><br/>
This is  actual acid test for your "strategy". Because, DMK is known for its family affinities.Party cadres work hard the cake is given to the members of the family of Shri.Karunanidhiji. Amma is already famous for free items, Amma food, that was the reason why AIADMK won the maximum MPs. Now Stalinji tells no share in the Government. Vijayakant is trying hard to become CM. Vaikoji, brings small parties into fold. This means finally, Amma will take the maximum MLAs . As the opposition votes are divided among the groups. Finally, even with 20-22% votes, AIADMK will form Government. This is the simple arithmatics. What amount of trucks, Vedios, change in the dress code, meeting the small group of people is not going to stop AIADMK to take over again: Provided DMK changes its strategy and invite allthe opposition groups and share in the Government. A government cannot be run by a members of single family with sons,daughter, grandson etc.  There are many party workers who spent many months, times in jail for DMK, but the fruits are eaten by KKs family. DMK lost its image as the party for Dravidan, but for KKs.  <br/><br/>
So, dear Prashant Kishoreji, take this challenge in Tamil Nadu and prove that your strategy worked and we accept that same strategy worked in MP elections, and Bihar elections. <br/><br/>
Best wishes<br/>

                            With Lalu's backseat driving, this Govt.is going to be an unmitgated disaster right from day one. In such a case the people of Bihar should move the consumer court for adequate compensation from these so-called strategists for dumping a deficient and dysfunctional product!

                            I do not think it is worth to say these things proudly...Any 4-5 intelligent guys can do this...I cannot imagine how foolish is media to project these guy....Utter nonsense....They work for money and they could do that for Laloo...see that...By the way JDU got much less than what it got when it contested with BJP last time....So stop nonsense...This only helped Laloo to emerge from coffins...BJP lost because of centralization...they became too defensive and asked Modi to bat...The only thing this made is to make people of remain poor for one more decade...They just played with emotions of people...

                            After reading this line "IPAC was set up with the motto to support deserving and good leaders for political offices. And a decision to work with the Sushasan Babu, Mr Nitish Kumar, for his election victory was indeed a reflection of that motto."<br/><br/>
Lalu was elected along with his sons. Not my idea of deserving candidates. <br/><br/>
Doesn't this IPAC sound like real evil? Along with being a lier?

                            One thing is clear our PM can gather crowds in large numbers in one place but it doesn't translate every time into votes. Where are these people who chant modi modi modi during voting?<br/><br/>
As a strategist and i as a comman want to know how to you create these huge crowds for MODI.... now Nitish. From where does the money come for these well managed crowds, stadiums &amp; the chantings sound like when we see reality shows people clapping as if on cue "CLAP" "LAUGH" "SHOUT MODI MODI MODI", etc.

                            Just one question to PK &amp; team: Despite of promoting Nitish so meticulously why was there such a big drop in the seats won by him in 2010 and in 2015. You can claim Nitish's victory however I fail to see it.I see this election result as a win for anti national parties who masked themselves behind Nitish's candidature as CM.

                            It is not you but the great RSS chief who helped nitish to win the election. He deliberately made reservation comment during the second phase and in next 3 phases BJP was out. Nitish should be greatful to rss chief not to you

                            Who's the fool out here looking for conscience in these electioneers ? These guys were in Jobs so just pay them more money and they'll get Mr. Gandhi win the next general elections or maybe Lalu be our PM sometime with these guys around with there iPhone's and MAC's. <br/><br/>
Question is are we as a nation subject to first the media propaganda and next with these white collar consultants? <br/><br/>
I am agitated and I will be unfair with IIT's : These institutions have never ever till date given a true R&amp;D professional to work for India and at this worst they are now providing these societal nuisance. <br/><br/>
I would say keep on imitating America Pratik, Prashant &amp; Co. but we will fight you back out for sure.

                            Just in case you are projecting that you did a good job for Nitish, sorry you failed. Only 71 out of 101 is not a good result in comparison to RJD 81 out of 101 without any Prashant Kishore.

                            is it really Nitishkumar's success ? Figuratively speeking it's Lalu's victory than the former's who lost way more seats while Lalu gained.
