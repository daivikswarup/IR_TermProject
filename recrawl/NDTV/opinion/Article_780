Headline::::What BJP's Bengaluru Victory Reveals



DateTime::::2015-08-26T15:04:00+05:30




                                The voters of Bengaluru have spoken. The BJP has got the majority in the BBMP Council with 100 seats and 40% of votes polled, while the Congress is next with 75 seats and 39% of votes polled. In over 18 seats, the Congress lost narrowly within 1% of votes. A very close verdict indeed.
The last five years have been bad for the citizens of Bengaluru. The last Council was the most corrupt in our history, with scandals like midnight tenders, the burning of records, creation of false and bogus bills, and huge siphoning of money. The government created an inquiry committee which disclosed gory details. Garbage, solid waste, drinking water, footpaths, roads were all in a mess with a garbage mafia, a water tanker mafia, a contractor mafia and extortion rackets run by some in power rampant across the city. In many parts of the city, people could not construct unless the area corporator was paid off. Building plans had to be paid for with local corporators and most approvals came with tariff cards for bribes. Real estate companies have many gory tales to tell. Of course, there were a few honest, diligent corporators but they were in a minority.
In the midst of this, the earlier BJP and the current Congress governments were helpless. Bengaluru suffered the most with the quality of our life declining rapidly and most citizens frustrated and angry.
The result of the poll with the BJP getting a majority after such bad and corrupt governance may surprise many. Citizens cast their vote for PM Narendra Modi in the hope that his promise of clean governance will be delivered by his party men. The BJP capitalised on the popularity of PM Narendra Modi to squeak into power. The Congress fought hard, spent enormously, but lost narrowly in many wards due to many reasons.
After being elected in 2013, the Congress government has been indifferent to Bengaluru in the first two years of its reign, capitalizing on its big victory in the rural areas. It cut funds for urban areas, increased subsidies hugely to its constituency, ignored industry without a full-time industries minister and generally was indifferent to the city despite the city making up the major share of state taxes and GDP. It was reminiscent of the JDS-created urban-rural divide when the then PM Shri Deve Gowda took on the IT and urban leadership publicly.
Our Chief Minister, after pressure from the media and Bengalureans, warmed up to the needs of the city over the last six months and set up a committee to restructure BBMP. Sadly, his efforts did not succeed due to political reasons and mishandling of the government's case before the Supreme Court. He announced major infrastructure projects to ease traffic, superseded the BBMP, putting in a reputed senior official as administrator and tried to turn it around. He also put his reputation on the line, leading the Congress campaign personally, putting large resources at work. It was too little too late, and the personal popularity of our PM and his belated efforts to turn around the city conspired to make the Congress second-best though very narrowly!
 
The elections carry many lessons for both parties. The BJP was reduced to banking on the popularity of the PM to get 100 seats. Its number and voting lead since the last election has come down as its bad governance record and inability to control corruption in its ranks hurt its reputation. The Congress paid the price for its belated discovery that the city really matters to the state as the engine of its economy and the control of the city is vital to its interest. It tried valiantly to make up, but the effort was not sufficient; nevertheless it improved its seats and voting percentage. Certainly the inability to win the city would hurt and weaken the Chief Minister as he put his reputation on the line in a party which clearly revels in power games and has dissension in its ranks.
 
Citizens now expect a corruption-free governance and focus on making the city more liveable. Bengaluru is the richest in the country in per capita terms with a very large educated middle class and globally-dominant industries. Its infrastructure is around 15 years behind its need. It needs governance reforms as it is too big to be managed by a broken BBMP, and needs to be restructured into five smaller corporations as suggested by the reforms committee. It needs care and investment to enable the state's growth. Hopefully the lessons of this election will be learnt by both parties and they will focus on improving the quality of life of citizens.
As a large number of voters have reposed faith in our PM, citizens expect our PM to ensure that his party men give a corruption-free regime over the next 5 years. We also expect the BJP corporators to take a new oath along with the oath of office - Main khaoonga nahin, na doosro ko khane doonga! The same promise made by our PM which he has lived by so far. Nothing less than this oath will satisfy citizens now that elections are over.(Mohandas Pai was the CFO and then the head of HR at Infosys.

                            It is the lack of gratitude on the part of citizens when , rather than the BJP controlled BBMP, the government intervened to solve crises like garbage , flooding etc. Seems caste loyalties of the politically dominant castes and sabotage of the Congress from within by disgruntled old and seemingly senile and jobless "leaders", who enjoyed bounties from the same party, was responsible for the narrow rout of the Congress.

                            The politically dominant class , which has enjoyed power inspite of being in a numerical minority of the state's population and undoubtedly a minority in the city, do not seem to have digested the ascension to power of a backward class leader , who is also delivering good administration. One suspects the disgruntled leaders from the dominant castes in the Congress party must have worked for the victory of the BJP in an attempt to dislodge Siddarmaiah. Siddaramaih has not been backed by any caste group or maths running educational institutions or "religious" leaders of dominant castes. It is an indication of caste polarization that seems to be taking place with hitherto politically dominant castes(30% of the population) siding with the BJP/JD)S) and the rest with the Congress and other non-right parties

                            the BJP itself was in BBMP last,  the elections as per me means simply that the party with deeper pockets has won. And no Bangalore has not spoken coz the voting % was very low

                            A simplistic analysis of support to a corrupt and ineffective administration at the city level. While Bengaluru need not be ignored by the ruling party, it would be rather preposterous to say that paying attention to rural areas is unacceptable. If tax collections and local wealth is the sole basis for resource allocation in a country then very few cities in India would deserve all the attention. Mr. Pai should know better than this. Already the bias towards urban India in telling. I thought the citizens of Bengaluru were smarter than to believe that a PM of the country can directly work for the betterment of a city. The local corporator will continue to be corrupt until she/he is held accountable by the citizen. Better governance is not possible through a single leader in a large democratic country like ours. It is institutions which make the difference. And, this requires sustained, patient, and relentless engagement of the citizen. Bengaluru with its more than average literacy rates should easily be able to understand this and act accordingly. Not rely on a "hero" at a remote location to come their rescue. This is indeed a lazy and surprisingly, poorly informed option.

                            Main reason is that the congress government is seen as extremely corrupt, inefficient and lethargic. Even business is worried and might shift out of the state with many leaders opening complaining. Karnataka is losing out to other states in new investments, especially to the aggressive Naidu in AP. However, the CM and his Govt hardly care and are doing nothing for the City and the State. Even though the last BBMP council was corrupt the citizens rightly judged that the Congress led council would be even more corrupt like the State/UPA Govts. People will not forget Muniratna of Congress who virtually ran the BBMP from his house. Now the elections are over, we can only hope that the state government will support the corporation to provide an efficient administration.

Why did Pai not highlight at least one corruption that happened in previous regime. Hoe could have done it easily with his clout and influence. Dear Mr. Pai Please show actions rather writing and coming so called news channels to give talks.

BJP's is win is nothing to do with PM. It had no modi magic... It's just that we didn't had a choice and last couple of years congress rule didn't meet people's expectation. I am sure BJP is no better. now that we have a congress ruled state govt and BJP ruled BBMP, i don't think BBMP can work in this situation. There will be more politics than development. We are just left with Hope again..!!

I am not a very intellectual person however I didn't expect an eminent person like Mr Pai would also comment or drag the PM into BBMP elections. I really appreciate hood comment on the Oath though but I think people should start thinking beyond Modihowever take him and his work as inspiration. Jai Hind.

                            Sadly, even media too was mostly blind of the industrialists' plight when Manohar Parrikar said that "when an industrialist wants a permission, he has to face 16 inspectors  but a rape victim has to face only one inspector". It was grossly misinterpreted and the actual subject of Parrikar's statement was largely unheard.

                            Dear Mr.Pai,<br/>
It looks like u were expecting the congress to win and they having lost you are sermonising on what the elected corporators have to do. If the congress lost by less than 1% in 18 constituencies they have won more number of constituencies with lesser margin, remember the margin in basavanapura ward i.e., a mere 10 votes. Similarly if the previous bbmp council was scam filled, the question is why did the state government allow it run for more than two and half years? This election had much to do with candidates themselves as much as the political party, bangaloreans are not dumb to vote for BJP just seeing the PM's face, we know the PM cannot and should not come down to the level of overseeing a corporation. And no small is not beautiful when it comes to bangalore, we are not interested in breaking up BBMP and that is one major reason for the congress losing out. As for infrastructure projects whatever Mr. Yeddiurappa announced is yet to be implemented, for example signal free corridor from mekhri circle to hope farm. Why did not the congress government take up these, just announcing more projects just before the elections wont work.

                            If Arvind Kejriwal were to become the Prime Minister, he would probably start arguing that he needs to have a control over the oil prices and an international oil price would be an infringement into his authority. What's the point in a second enquiry, when the Anti-Corruption Branch is already looking into it?

                            Being a voter from Bangalore, this time it was so difficult to vote for a right party. Unfortunately there was no NOTA option aswell in the ballot.<br/>
BJP cant just continue to blame Congress govt, infact BBMP has become a mess since last 8 years, corruption is at its peak. <br/>
For Congress, our sleepy CM should wake up and realize the fact that he cant just continue to ignore the city and continue to give 1rs/kg rice, he is more into appeasing politics just focusing on certain sections of the society.<br/><br/>
Another factor i would like to highlight is people in karnataka caste there votes based on which caste they belong to, shame on such people, infact i was told by my dad to vote for a particular party as candidate is of our caste ;) . <br/>
These politicians will only think of there growth, so wake up citizens.<br/><br/>
I am pretty sure nothing new council will be much worse that before, COngress govt will not allocate funds for BBMP projects to take revenge against people who voted BJP.<br/>
At the same time BJP corporators/Mayor will continue to blame congress govt for lack of funds.<br/><br/>

May be BJP is more organized, well planned machinery, devoted workers and all.... But how can Mr. Modi be responsible for Victory or defeat of a Municipality kind local body? that too, of Bangaluru, where you yourself say.... "Bengaluru is the richest in the country in per capita terms with a very large educated middle class and globally-dominant industries" ......

                            Agreed. apart from the points already mentioned, it is important that the BBMP operates truly like any other organisation. Mayor is indeed the CEO of the BBMP or its split version.  I don't mind that we pay them salaries that is paid to CEOs. But importantly they need to deliver. For Bangalore to become a truly global city, we need to address the following problems<br/>
1: Solid waste management. Plenty of ideas given , but we are zero on execution. Let us get going<br/>
2: Corruption : Make the entire working of BBMP transparent. Go the online way. Lessons can be learnt from the Central Government(All clearances are going the e - way)<br/>
3:Empowerment : Make the respective corporator responsible for overseeing and implementing projects in his ward. Have a ward level meeting with key citizens from the ward and let the officials make the presentation. Make Citizens part of the development process.<br/>
4: Traffic management: This is related to bigger problem of transportation. People hate driving cars in this city. How do we make public transport more acceptable to people ? You cannot change the city roads nor make it wider ? How do we accelerate metro development to reach far flung areas and outskirts ? How do we achieve last mile connectivity ? Unless we solve the problem as a whole, we will keep trying out piece meal solutions. <br/>
5: Strategic planning : Let BBMP  have a strategy team with experts drawn from urban planning, smart city development and any other field and plan for 2050 and beyond. If we don't think long term, we will always be fire fighting. <br/>

                            What it reveals is more garbage on the streets of Bengaluru and continuance of Garbage administration at the City offices. Shameful!

                            I voted after looking up the BPAC list. Have to thank Mr.Pai and folks in BPAC who took time and effort to screen folks in an impartial manner that allowed for someone to spend few minutes to decide on who I should be voting for. There is no way I would know the credibility of the candidate. <br/><br/>
Interestingly, though I am pissed with Congress for being such sour losers in the center, I did not know that it was BJP that was running the BBMP. You would have highlighted that factor in the huge bill boards I saw in Outer ring road and other message that would have helped IT folks like me that don't follow day to day administration closely but responsible enough to vote and make my vote count.

                            The writer wants change in the regime but not succeeded therefore blaming the PM for it. what PM will do in municipality election. I am surprise that people are thinking that garbage in their area should be clean by PM. Our PM has to fight with outside sources not with inside your city.

                            In its habitual smugness, Congress imagined that all the blame for the deterioration in the city will be laid at the BJP's door and it could simply sit on the sidelines and reap the gains.  This falling popularity of the Congress was evident to everyone and the party's recent shenanigans in holding the Parliament to ransom were clearly perceived by all as the typical 'dog in the manger' behaviour. Simply put, Congress lost many of its followers and friends in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections, falling from 206 to a measly 44, and its subsequent perverse and petulant conduct, coupled with vile and personal abuse of Mr Modi, has ensured that it continues to  lose.

                            I agree voting BJP means voting NaMo, honest, sincere face of BJP. There are very few leaders in BJP whom we can trust, otherwise most of them are there in BJP and politics to make fast bucks like congress and other political parties. Only hope in this country is NaMo.

                            Sir, bribes for construction plan approval is not confined to Bangalore. It is there every where. In hyderabad (Kapra circle) we have to give &gt;25k for plan approval to corporation engineer. Corruption had deep roots in Indian society, no body can change &amp; save this country

                            The onus is now on the BJP leadership and Mr.Modi to deliver good governance.Modi need to weild the broom and stick to clear the corrupt leaders and members who capitalise on Modis image.Modi should mercilessly throw the corrupt elements and if the councillor cannot deliver he or she should be thrown with out mercy.Unfortunately Yediurappa has brought lot of bad reputation with his corruption and rogues like Reddy brothers. Hope Modi clear the party from corrupt baniyas

                            Very unbalanced article. The reason of BJP win despite millions of Rupees spent by Congress due the following :-<br/>
1) The corruption is at State level organised by the Congress Party. All the Mafias are protected by Congress leaders.<br/>
2) The Catholic-Islamic union for the destruction of India, known in India as secularists are represented by the Congress party. The voting public in Bengaluru is educated and marginally effluent, hence they naturally vote against the corrupt Congress. Only uneducated, poor people and enemies of state vote for congress.<br/>
3) Due to flow of information on social media, lies and loaded messages by foreign owned press in India is losing its appeal. <br/>
Please wake up and smell the coffee before educated effluent Indians decide to take matters in their own hands and punish the anti Indian lier.

                            This is a strong message to the congress that they have done nothing for Bengaluru. It's time they pull up their socks. Also BJP should not be proud of this victory. They should focus on good governance and lead the way.

                            There were instances of caste-conflicts by BJP and its close associates, which is really no way likeable, Hindu and Muslims can not talk, Boys and girls can not talk, no freedom of love between two different community are backward signs of BJP everywhere. Bengaluru is no exceptional, what Mohan Das has to say to recent incidents?

This election or any election for that matter is fought between corrupt politicians! Their only aim is to loot!<br/><br/>
we need a honest party. India will not improve...there should be a honest regional political party ...We need Narayana Murthy as CM in Karnataka! <br/><br/>
Can't we find 30 honest people in the country to recruit honest political candidates ? SAD

                            Good analysis by Mr. PAI.Inc lost vid people r aware that congress is mother of corruption and Goondas. Corruption by congress is upright seen, otherwise they would not have managed to buy 7 independent corporates. Therefore there is no hope as long as anti hinds Siddaram stays as CM
