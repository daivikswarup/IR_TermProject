Headline::::The Black Money Bill Is Like A 'Medu Vada'



DateTime::::2015-05-13T15:56:00+05:30




                                The government has used the extended session of parliament to pass a new bill in the Lok Sabha as part of its efforts to persuade the nation that it is serious about tackling the problem of "black money". Assuming it is soon enacted - which it will be, since it has been deemed to be a "money bill" and so the Rajya Sabha can do nothing about it but discuss it and return it to the Lower House - we will soon have a law on the books to punish Indians who have undeclared accounts or other assets abroad. Any undeclared amount above Rs.5 lakhs will incur a 120% penalty and result in a stiff jail term for the offender. But before the righteous pop the champagne corks to celebrate the prospect of the cells of Tihar Jail overflowing with well-heeled elites, a few sobering demurrals are in order.
 
None of us disagrees, obviously, that black money is a serious problem. The Congress Party has made it very clear that we would support any serious effort by the Government to bring back black money to this country. But this Bill has four fatal flaws. Though my party did support the bill, we did not do so blindly. It has some real limitations we would have liked to have seen improved.
 
The first is that this Bill rests on the premise that foreign assets and foreign accounts are the principal problem in black money. They are not. Of course, no one has any real idea of the scale of the problem. The Ministry of Finance says that there is no official estimate of black money abroad, and they are right. A number of figures were advanced during the Lok Sabha debate, with the highest, from a more objective source than Baba Ramdev - the US-based agency Global Financial Integrity  - placing the sum of illicit transfers out of India at about Rs. 28 lakh crore. But that figure still doesn't amount to the  15 lakhs per Indian that the BJP promised to put into every citizen's account; it actually works out to under Rs. 25,000 per Indian in black money outside the country.  So, first of all, the scale of the problem is much smaller than the public has been led to assume.
 
The fact is that domestic black money is a much bigger figure (some say it may be almost as much as the entire official economy) and is a much larger problem. Yet, domestic tax evasion remains a civilian offence whereas this Bill criminalizes foreign assets. Let's face it: this Bill is a pure political diversion by the BJP to distract the people from the Government's failure to actually tackle black money generation within India.
 
In fact, even black money generated abroad is brought back to India as FDI through so-called round-tripping, especially via investment havens like Mauritius (from which $4.9 billion dollars came into India during the last financial year). In other words, there's much more black money here than abroad, including black money that was once abroad. So, if this Bill is indeed as ambitious as the Minister says, the ambition seems to consist of scratching the tip of the iceberg.
 
The second fatal flaw is that there is no mechanism to actually retrieve information on the defaulters, which requires agreements with foreign governments. There are governments with which we have concluded agreements within the UPA era.  Are there any new governments that have come on board to give us information? How many governments are willing to cooperate with us in this effort?
 
We know that foreign countries are just not waiting to hand over information to us about Indians holding black money in their countries. The fact is that their domestic laws and International Treaty obligations will prevail. For example, the Swiss Government will not reveal information on Swiss Bank deposits, and cannot reveal them under their own laws, until we provide the names of individuals we are investigating, the names of the banks where they have their money, and evidence of criminality in the acquisition of this money. The Swiss government has said that they will not support any "fishing expedition" by the Indian government looking for Indian names in their banks. The government of India has announced harsh punitive measures in today's Bill, but how will punitive measures alone promote compliance when the Government has no way of knowing who has assets abroad, or of getting information that will inculpate people?
This is why I joked in Parliament that the Finance Minister, who once used to enjoy good South Indian food, has given us a medu vada Bill - a Bill with a big hole in the middle of it. That big hole is the lack of means of obtaining information about those whom the government actually wants to prosecute. You can announce threats of jail and hefty fines, but you cannot fine or jail "persons unknown".
 
The third flaw is, paradoxically enough, that this Bill gives unbridled powers to the tax authorities, assessing officers, Enforcement Directorate, CBDT and others, while overlooking the great failures of tax administration in our country. The Bill essentially recreates the Inspector Raj of the pre-liberalisation days. It does so by giving the taxman judicial powers, powers to scrutinise files for 16 years, levy penalties, make people criminally liable, and more. This is all the more ironic since this is a government that has disempowered most of its Ministers and bypassed most bureaucrats except the ones who are in the PMO. The only people who are gaining power now in this government are the taxmen.
If these powers are exercised and abused, the Government will drive people away from India: there is already a surge of inquiries about becoming NRIs. There are no safeguards for protecting the innocent. Those who provide inadequate information in good faith will still be punished. The bigger worry is that this kind of tax tyranny will drive away businesses as well. It does not square with the government's vaunted determination to improve India's ease of doing business.
 
Worse, the Bill completely overlooks the very poor quality of tax administration in this country. There are real questions about the integrity of our tax process. There are also capacity issues, including a large number of vacancies in the Enforcement Directorate. One concrete example of the system's limitations is that the Government missed its deadline of 31st March, 2015 for prosecuting black money holders abroad under the existing Income Tax Act, 1961. Out of 427 actionable cases in the HSBC list, the Special Investigation Team has prosecuted only 200 of them. If the Government does not have the capacity even to go after the names which it already has, what is it going to do with the ones it doesn't know about under this new Bill?
 
The fourth and final flaw is a fundamental one -- this Bill is not part of an overall strategy. An overall strategy should focus on controlling the generation of black money, which will need a comprehensive approach that includes serious tax reforms and rationalisation; reforming real estate practices (and there are a whole series of things which need to be done there); improving the quality of education so that black money does not come into the education system; tackling black money in politics, which we never talk about in Parliament, though every MP knows that politics is awash in black money; and taking action against hawala networks.
 
No such larger comprehensive strategy has been articulated by the Government. Instead, it has offered a Bill that, like modern dating, offers short-term gratification without long-term commitment. This Bill is an attempt to look tough and to seem to be taking decisive action, but it is not anchored or integrated into such a sensible strategy.
 
We need a comprehensive approach to black money. This isn't it.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr Modi won't and can't bring back BLACK MONEY. Mr Modi first stop this so called desi BLACK MONEY aka'illicit capital'/'parallel economy'/'black wealth', and 'dirty money' of dirty rich Indians such as corporates/builders/celebrities/cricketers/politicians so on. That would be more beneficial for the country than making drama of bringing black money stashed abroad.

                            First you refuse to set up an SIT to probe the black money even after the Supreme Court rapped you continuously for 3 consecutive years. Now when Modi is trying to bring back the black money you want to oppose the bill and yet you say he has done nothing . You want to oppose the black money Bill and also say that we tried our best to bring back black money, when made no effort at all. Are you absolutely shameless. Don't you get tired of licking the Dynastys feet?

Well written article but if you had persuaded your leader and his cheerleaders to stop doing the fire and forget interventions and go for a proper debate in parliament, you can do better. Also the two bills that you have blocked the GST and Real Estate bills pretty much aim to control domestic black money. So please do look inwards too. Please understand people of India are not fools and please tell that to your leader as well, 70s era povertaniasm does not work.

                            It is true that there is significant amount of black money within the country in form of cash, benami assets etc. But criticizing this govt. is laughable. At least this govt. is doing something even if it is flawed and not enough. What has Congress done in last 10 years, leave alone last 60 years, Nothing. They have let the things go from bad to worse.  Only an idiot can say 28 lakh crore is not big. Just pointing to some possibly inaccurate estimates does not take away the focus on complete failure of UPA govt.

                            Why did then his party support the bill? Also, how does one provide in the bill, the ways to overcome the 'four' fundamental flaws? Should the bill make provisions like "If any foreign Govt does not give the list of offenders, India should sever the diplomatic ties with that country / do not give Visas for that country's people / do not allow Indians to enter India if they visit such countries?". Dr Tharoor, understandably as opposition member, will try to point out the lacunae but no solution. Any suggestion to improve the bill (without protecting the guilty) should be welcome, irrespective of which party it comes from. The comparison with 'modern dating' (i.e short-term gratification without long-term commitment) is nice and hope no 'elite' modern people would harp on it.

                            Congress knowingly supports a bill that has 4 fatal errors and then complaints that this is not enough. NDA wants to amend a bill i.e. Land Bill which had errors bit that is not ok, that is anti poor. There is an attempt to do something by this govt. The article basically tries to show that Congress is aware of where the black money is , the locations also that there is a domestic parallel black money economy, but they want the current govt to do all the work of cleaning up since they were ok with the system since they kept getting a cut .. the direct benefit transfer scheme is one of the ways in which the local black money menace is being tackled ... the very subsidy scheme that has made many congi's millionaires ... there is more air in this article than the air in hot air balloon ... oppose for the sake of opposing ... keep up this work and next time guys wont even get 44 seats...

                            Astounding!  We hear a litany of problems (ignoring genuine steps taken by NDA) but NO solutions! Typical congress style. The party which blocked any action on black money for years are now preaching to the choir.<br/><br/>
Let me counter point by point<br/>
a) 28 Lakh Crore is NOT a small amount by any yardstick. For Shashi's kind info, this is almost one-fourth of Indian real GDP. It is certainly worth going after. <br/><br/>
b)  If last year alone round tripping is USD 4 Billion, I presume it was the same even in earlier years. Why couldn't congress control it?  In fact it was Congress which facilitated it by encouraging participatory notes (without declaration of owners). Does Mr Shashi have the guts to accept this? Where was Shashi when Congress allowed Participatory notes? NDA plugged this loop hole when it made it mandatory for owners of Participatory notes to be declared last year. Is Mr Shashi willing to give credit to NDA for this ? So NDA have done something to curb round tripping to some extent. It is a shame that Shashi conveniently forgot to mention this key step.<br/><br/>
c) Yes we may not know information about those who smuggle cash to Swiss Banks. But there are many who blatantly keep money abroad. The law will have a salutary affect on those who indulge in depositing black money abroad. At least if it is found, they cannot escape anymore for want a domestic law. <br/>
More than the existing offenders, this law will be a big deterrent to the new offenders. Let us not trivialize the effect of that. The best thing is that the bill has specified a quantum of punishment clearly.<br/><br/>
d) The objection of inefficient tax department is laughable. Yes Tax administration needs to be improved. Does Shashi stop paying tax because tax administration is poor? This is certainly not a cause for inaction. The law is made and eventually the tax administration can use technology and improve their skills to catch genuine offenders and stop harassing innocent ones. If Shashi is so concerned, he and his party should have suggested an ombudsman for aggrieved citizens who are harassed by tax authorities and some regulatory oversight of the Income tax department. Instead all we hear is tactics to justify blocking the bill.<br/><br/>
e)The Supreme court is now monitoring the whole issue and essentially fronts the strategy. Eminent personalities like Jethmalani/ Swamy are involving themselves. NDA is going after the big aspects. This bill goes after, one part of the problem, Foreign unaccounted money. The NDA has also proposed a bill to make benami property unlawful. These are serious steps. Everybody knows maximum black money is in real estate. It is probably the most critical step taken in last 60 years to combat internal black money. In addition once properly implemented, it can serve the purpose of bringing down unrealistically high real estate prices, which is  un-affordable even for middle class. Congress as a responsible opposition should participate in meaningful discussions (not just score political points) and improve the bill.  They need to perform if they are to be a responsible opposition. They are not in power anymore to continue the same level of incompetence seen during the Maa-Beta Sarkar.<br/><br/>
I did expect better from Shashi. He has disappointed on this one.<br/>
Shashi should criticize constructively, be unbiased while writing articles (cite all aspects and not one sided points conveniently ignoring facts) and contribute to the betterment of the country.

Why  treat black money abroad any different from black money at home .. Atleast black money at home the Government can find on its own n prosecute ...

                            For most of the post-independence period, Congress has been in power and if anybody knows about Black Money, it is Congress.  Motilal Nehru, founder of the dreadful dynasty was a lawyer in Allahabad.  He was able to afford the fees of his son Jawaharlal to study at Harrow and Cambridge.  A small town lawyer does not make a lot of money so where did Motilal's money come from?  Further, Motilal is alleged to have given all his wealth, including Anand Bhavan to the nation.  Where did the money to acquire those assets come from?  At the height of the Independence struggle, Jawaharlal sent his wife Kamala for treatment to Switzerland.  Where did that money come from.  Jawaharlal's dreadful daughter was sent to Cambridge and to a Swiss finishing school.  Where did the money come from?  Indira's dreadful son Rajiv was sent to Cambridge.  Where did the money come from?  Where was the Borfor's money stashed?  Where was Tharoor going to stash the IPL money he stood to make? The story is never ending.  Perhaps a little less pontificating from Tharoor will go down well.

The way he is writing, it looks as if he is aware of the amount of black money abroad, the countries where the money is hidden &amp;by whom,and the route through which black money travels etc.What prevented him from doing the right things when UPA was in power? What prevents him now from giving this information to FM rather than ridiculing his bill as a Medu Wada. He talks about black money within the country but writes little to say who created it. There is only one logic in whatever Congresswallahs including Rahul Gandhi are doing today. " Blunt the efforts of NDA Govt,. by hook or mostly  by crook such that their good initiatives are brought to nought.

                            Seems like Tharoor has a vested interest in scuttling this bill. Curbing black money is a poll promise of the BJP. Nothing wrong. Why get upset about it? The bill may not be perfect, but definitely a welcome first step.

                            A logic conveniently omitted by author and his supporters is that in want of 100% perfect law with 100% complete solutions, one cannot deadly formulation and implementation of laws that may be 40 or 50 % efficient.  Such exercises are a work in progress and one cannot sit with intellectual and political inertia for want of a 100% perfect solution. Also this bill includes FOREIGN accounts.  So why are we meddling it with domestic black money? ?? Books for tackling domestic money are seperate and should be discussed then. <br/>
And can someone post a link where Modi has aid that 15 lakh will come in everyone's account? ?? All he said was there is so much money that each Indian can have 15 lakh in account. Where did he promise the money? ? And do you guys seriously think that he was voted with majority because people thought he would give them 15 lakh in account? ???

                            BJP was shouting a lot before election that it will bring back black money from overseas within 100 days and each Indian will get 15 lakh. Now they have won the election they don't care any more. Another more important point is the amount of black money within India is many many times more than that overseas. why are they not trying to get black money within India and prosecute the crooks within the country? It seems to be just another trick to fool people and win election. When it comes to fooling people BJP and Congress are the same.

                            I am no fan of Tharoor and on other matters like Sunanda's death there are open questions. But this article is not about Sunanda. Its about a bill which has now passed both LS &amp; RS. The article very clearly states that while there may be some intent on the part of the Govt. to tackle the issue of black money stashed abroad the bill is woefully short when it comes to methodology. Although I have often wondered will all those who hold black money abroad just keep it there for the Govt. to grab it and bring it back. The money must have moved through several countries and now lying in some place where it is impossible to reach. Rhetoric cannot replace intelligent action. Modi Govt. has failed miserably in this case.

                            @Pushpak: Providing you the logic you asked for. There are 3 major sources of black money in India; namely - real estate, jewellery business and all other tax evaders, including politicians. The last one is the most difficult to tackle directly but the government has done sufficiently, if not excessively, on the first 2 in the form of real estate bill and PAN being a necessity for purchases beyond 50k. Now, this bill covers ANYONE who has disproportionate assets and makes it a CRIME. All bills are stopping evasion of illicit money circulation within India, not ones sitting or coming from outside. Finally, while round-tripping does happen, it is through FII (particularly P-notes) not FDI. Any dirty money that comes and is invested for creating assets and jobs is not necessarily bad, but same cannot be said about P-notes. All-in-all, there are lots of half-truths and intentional masquerading of truths in the article. I have presented the facts, its up to you believe!

                            The same things can be said about any law. We cannot even ensure that the road laid is of the specified quality for which money is being paid. Does this mean that nothing should be attempted? Congressmen are status quoist. They hardly did anything and cannot see others do something.

                            If an NRI who pays taxes abroad also classified as Indian with foreign account? What if the country does not have dual taxation agreement with India? Should he be terrified of Indian tax officials? If the officers can go back back to even 16 years per this law, do people have to save all these papers of all closed and opened accounts and their bank statements for 16 years?<br/><br/>
This rule sounds more terrifying than logical. Obviously people are trying to become NRIs and never look to come back to India.

                            Mr Shashi you are absolutely right. The black money generated domestically during the last one year is mind boggling. This govt has no serious intention to deal with black money and people of the country has been fooled by rhetorics.

                            The Black Money Act may lead to money laundering. Black money embedded in productive activity in India may get shifted out of the county through the medium of hawala channels for the acquisition of assets abroad, leading to manipulation of acquisition cost or fair market value. No machinery provisions have been incorporated for verifying the veracity of the acquisition cost or fair market value. No time frame has been fixed to bring back the black money by way of inward remittances, which could not only have strengthened our foreign exchange reserve but also accelerated the financial activity within the country. Payment of taxes and penalty out of such remittances should have been made mandatory.

                            It is an open secret that real estate and especially land is one of the biggest tools for peddling black money in the country. Instead of doing a drama in te nam eof black money stashed abroad, govt must do something for domestic black money first which is not less if not more than black money abroad. But I seriously doubt if BJP will do it as BJP has equally corupt guys as Congress with massive illegal wealth.

                            @Pushpak: Here is the logic you asked for. (BTW, I am no bakhth but certainly favour of any nationalist party like BJP). There are mainly 3 sources of black money in India - real estate, jewellers and politicians. If you are not already aware concrete steps have been taken to tackle the first 2 (in the form of real estate bill and requiring PAN for purchase beyond 50k). The last one is really tricky one because BJP might have many people with illicit money and has to be tread carefully. Shashi knowing too well about real estate being a major source has not talked about it at all since he knows very well that he will trounced immediately with counter-logic. Last but not the least readers are being misled by saying round-tripping happens in the form of FDI. Sorry, it comes back as FII, particularly P-notes, which was very famously (or should I say infamously?!) introduced and retained by ex-Finance minister PC and most of which are and cannot be tracked or traced. Even if illicit money comes back as FDI, its good for Indian economy if assets are being created. Hence, all-in-all, Shashi's viewpoints need to be respectfully discarded for all the above reasons and fully be with the government when such a positive step is being taken to curb illicit money.
