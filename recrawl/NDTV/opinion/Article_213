Headline::::Modi's Dilemma and BJP's Confusion



DateTime::::2016-01-11T14:08:00+05:30




                                The French have a saying: "The more it changes, the more it remains the same".
Immediately after Mumbai 26/11, the Pakistan Prime Minister called our Prime Minister to express his deep shock and horror and offered to unearth the culprits. And immediately after Pathankot 1/1, the Pakistan Prime Minister called our Prime Minister to express his deep shock and horror and offered to unearth the culprits.
Back in 2008, the Pakistanis set up a special court to expeditiously try and punish the culprits. Now in 2016, the Pakistanis have set up a special Commission of Enquiry to expeditiously identify and punish the perpetrators.
Then, they said they would promptly process the evidence we had given them. Once again, they have promised to promptly process the evidence we have given them. But our evidence then has not satisfied them or their courts. It is highly doubtful that this time round our evidence will satisfy them or their courts.
Then, they went on to arrest Hafiz Saeed. He was later let off by the courts. Perhaps this time, to appease Modi, they might arrest Masood Azhar, who will later be let off by the courts. Then, they told us Hafiz Saeed's LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) was banned - but it resurfaced under another guise. Now they tell us Masood Azhar's Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) is banned - but it has resurfaced under another guise.
Seven years on, Mumbai remains in a tangle in Pakistan's judicial jungle. I am willing to place a small bet that seven years from now, Pathankot will remain in a similar tangle. We've been here before. There is no reason to believe anything will be different now.
What is different is that then the BJP lathered itself into a rage and started the mantra, "Talks and Terror can't go together". Now it seems they are impaled on the horns of a dilemma: should they let talks go on despite terror and thus save Modi's face, or let terror overtake talks and thus save Modi's chair?
For the moment, Modi's government is keeping all options open, hoping against hope that Nawaz Sharif will be "prompt and decisive" in taking action against Pakistanis responsible for Pathankot. But what is "prompt"? They're not saying. And what is "decisive"? They're not saying. They are just praying that Nawaz will come out with a form of words and some pro-forma action that will enable them to hold the scheduled Foreign Secretary-level talks, perhaps a few weeks later than the 15th January schedule.
But that initial round of talks is only a beginning. It is no more than the clerical job of determining dates and venues for the progress of the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue (which, like everything the Modi government does, is nothing more than the new name for a process that goes back nearly two decades to 1997). That process will have to be carried forward step by step over an extended period of time, very possibly longer, much longer, than the three years available to the present Modi government. Controversies will beset the process. They will have to be patiently resolved. Dissent will have to be curbed. Consensus will have to be forged. Is that the style of the Modi government or the man who heads it?
When it comes to the really ticklish issues of Kashmir and terror, it will no more be a matter of juggling NSA talks before FS talks (or the other way round): it will require patience, non-partisanship and great sincerity and commitment to "uninterrupted and uninterruptible" dialogue to take the Manmohan-Musharraf "framework" for a final settlement of the Kashmir issue to its logical culmination. How can this be done when both Modi and Nawaz are in denial over what was accomplished in this regard on the back channel between 2004 and 2007 with the blessings of the political leadership of Dr. Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf?
And while all this is going on, there are bound to be elements, as much in Pakistani society at large as within the Pak establishment, who will resort to terror to sabotage the talks. When such terror attacks are repeated, will Modi's will to persist weaken or will he continue hoping that the Pak PM will call him to convey his condolences and set up one more Commission of Enquiry?
There is no sign of a strategy in the works. On the contrary, in place of a Pakistan policy we have a series of impetuous ad hoc steps taken on the spur of the moment, more designed to burnish one man's image than to tread a carefully drawn-up road map. Foreign policy cannot be a series of spurts and starts. It requires hard decisions - the hardest being the fact that whether we talk or not, terrorist attacks will be planned and executed and we need to know well in advance whether the BJP intend to follow their pre-Nawaz Birthday line of non-engagement with Pakistan until terror is ended or their sudden recent U-turn in favour of engagement even, perhaps, in spite of the Pathankot terror attack? Â 
None of this is new. It could and should have been foreseen when Modi dropped by to say, "Happy Birthday", indeed, even earlier - from May 2014 onwards. But with his usual flair for the dramatic, Modi has preferred to reserve to himself the right to disrupt his own initiatives, most strikingly by twice over playing the "You-can't-talk-to-the-Hurriyat" card to abort the Indo-Pak dialogue even before it has quite begun. Even now, there is no agreement between Modi and Nawaz Sharif over whether or not Pakistan may continue their 15-year practice, started in Atal Behari Vajpayee's time, of consulting with the Hurriyat. The practice has done the Pakistanis little good and us no harm - but the Modi government has made such a hullaballoo over not permitting any contact between the Hurriyat and Pakistan that it is difficult to see how we can enforce the H-ban and still talk to Pakistan over a red-line that Pakistan does not accept.
If the dialogue is to move forward relentlessly (albeit, perhaps glacially) to its goal of stabilizing Indo-Pak relations, the first requirement is not headline-grabbing gestures at Head of Government level, but talks about talks at the working level to structure the dialogue as an uninterrupted and uninterruptible process that takes full account of pitfalls that are bound to be encountered, especially terror attacks, and makes provision for overcoming such hurdles while the talks proceed. This neither Modi nor Nawaz have done - and so, hanging over the negotiating table like Banquo's ghost, some fanatic or the other, very possibly helped by rogue elements in the establishment, will take it upon himself or themselves to set the clock back by launching an attack. Pathankot shows that there is no lack of Indian collaborators to further the nefarious designs of Pakistani terrorists. And the very poor response of our security establishment to the Pathankot attack brings up questions of India's responsibility for not foiling the attack.
Better that terror be deprived of its capacity to undermine talks than for terror to hold talks hostage to those who are dead set against the talks.Â Â Â  Â (Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The jingoistic hectoring that the BJP in general and Modi in particular carried out in the run up to 2014 lections must have hit Modi, the BJP and the RSS like a thunder clap. One hopes lessons have dawned that the foreign affairs cannot be handled the way elections are campaigned for. Political  parties can become hyper with campaigning but the ruling party must carry out foreign affairs with quiet dignity and great gravitas and not in an exuberant event management style. Although chemistry between leaders is important , it cannot subsume diplomacy for diplomacy is essentially a matter between two states and not two individuals. Mani Iyer as well as the Congress have maintained for decades that Pakistan must be engaged not through useless jingoism but through meaningful and uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue. Iyer's article while lacking in sharpness of language is full of fine articulation of the art of diplomacy and subtle message about the failure of the government on that score thus far

                            Very nicely summed up. Very well put. <br/><br/>
It is true that 'tamashas' and optics are important but they cannot substitute for a well thought out and executed strategy. <br/><br/>
It seems that Modi and his government are trying various options, blowing hot, blowing cold. <br/><br/>
It is also a fact that there has been a significant (probably sensible) climb-down from the earlier chest-thumping and fire-breathing.<br/><br/>
However, the present government still seems far from a coherent working strategy.

                            The Fact that Bhakts have not come piling on abuse on Mani Shanker shows that Mani is spot on. Fact is that Modi;s birthday diplomacy  was so outlandish and childishm, that, the world is now waiting ti see how Modi govt reacts to the terror attacks. Fact is also, that Modi's NSA bungled badly, and Bhakts are hiding their faces and hanging their heads in Shame. Mani is absolutely right.

                            Irrespective of MSA's comment in Pakistan, he normally is in favor of (continuation of) talk with Pakistan, which broadly is sensible. But he seems to be in fix this time. He looks confused how to criticize this time? Talk is (likely to be) continued, and somewhat similarities between 2008 situation. Drawing parallel is premature but easier. After that he is unable to convince himself about what to criticize? Time will tell whether MSA's presumed assumption (Pak's investigation going nowhere) comes true or not. But I feel sorry for MSA, as he don't have anything concrete this time, even if aerial !!

                            By providing a means for a person like this one, who has not only insulted our Nation but also our Constitutional Position of PM should only amounts to a anti-National activities. NDTV and its group should immediately consider not to allow such a person who does not respect our National interest, its respect its platform to spread his personal venom. I do not know how a person like him was even in the diplomatic administration. He is irrelevant even to his political masters. I can only hope that NDTV and its group would stop allowing him to use its platform and do some National Service.

It is not possible for India to have just one strategy to deal with Pakistan. Pakistan is a trouble some country for India and for rest of world. UPA did not have any strategy. Modi is at least trying a few out of box things.

                            Usually Mani goes with anti Modi tom-tom but in this case his attacks has some merits. Modi's predicament is weather to pursue peace or continue tough posturing against Pakistan. He understands the reality and is trying to change the colors in sync with global realities but that has already costed him his image. Atleast now they should not fall trap to media theatrics but silently pursue the peace process. If NDA shows resilience and is able to stand the domestic pressure, I am sure we can have the process continued. Let the diplomacy do its job and let the military and intelligence counter the attacks through alternate strategy.

                            Mani Aiyer tries to get some comfort by writing such trash week after week, thinking it might give him and his band of thugs some relief from otherwise miserable and tormented life.

                            Dear Mr Mani Shankar. How can u predict about things which are not in your hand ? Pakistan &amp; India both should learn that the talks should NEVER be stopped. Talks between both countries should continuously take place without referring any &amp; all incidents of terror etc. etc. ONLY thing should be seen by both countries, that while talking - step-by-step, they both should agree and create relationship in areas (likes Diwali Celebrations, EID Celebrations) where both sides are EQUALLY benefitted. India should not give benefit to Pakistan only one-way &amp; vis-a-vis. BUT talking should be done at least every alternate month - if not every month. THEN by meeting several years such a way, there will be SOME WAY OUT. Cricket Matches or Hockey Matches do not bring both countries together. In fact, rivalry is created by MEDIA etc. by using very filthy words. Cricket &amp; Hockey or any Game will be healthy between two countries ONLY when they keep talking at least 10 years from now.
