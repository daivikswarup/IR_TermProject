Headline::::Really, RSS? An Anti-Conversion Law?



DateTime::::2014-12-23T01:09:00+05:30



(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)"Abhi chor pakra gaya hai. Mera Mal chor ke paas hai.Aur yeh duniya jaanti hai. Main apna Maal wapas loonga. Yeh kaun se badi baat hai" ( Now the thief has been caught. My belongings are with the thief. The world knows this. If I get my belongings back, what is the big deal?) These are not words spoken by Pakistani terrorists targeting Kashmir. These are words of Mohan Bhagwat, the made-in-India RSS Chief. It's not just the crudity of the statement that is objectionable - for the RSS chief, human beings exist as "belongings" or "maal" to be manipulated for a political agenda. His statement is objectionable and condemnable because it is a direct threat to all minorities in India. He further said " Why should we be scared? We are not infiltrators, we are not foreigners. This is a Hindu rashtra..." Decades ago, Bhagwat's predecessor MS Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS, had written a book called "We, Our Nationhood Defined." He considered Hitler his hero. It is worth revisiting his writings and speeches because the present Prime Minister considered him an inspiration and wrote his biography "Jyotipunj". Conflating race with religion, Golwalkar  had said, "There are only two courses open to foreign elements: merge themselves in the national race and adopt its culture, or live at the mercy of the national race."Let's make no mistake about it. The "ghar wapasi" - the so-called homecoming programmes being aggressively practiced by Hindutva outfits -  is another term for the "merger" envisaged by Golwalkar. It is conversion by coercion, conversion by social and physical pressure. Bhagwat's statement and the threats are against the constitution, against the law. The speech he made was in Kolkata. The West Bengal Government of Mamata Bannerjee should file a case against him under Sec 153a of the IPC for creating hostility between two communities. In addition, all the ghar wapasi programmes being organized are equally illegal and are a violation of the law under the same provisions. Ghar wapasi has little or nothing to do with religious belief and faith. It is a straight political slogan that encompasses within it the distorted Hindutva view of history, namely that all Indians have "Hindu roots", that Hindus were "forcibly converted to Islam or Christianity which are " foreign" religions, and that therefore it is a "nationalist " duty to bring them all "home" to the Hindutva family. For these people, India did not exist before the Aryan cultures, languages and texts became dominant. For them, for example, the rich traditions of adivasi history, spiritual and religious beliefs and rituals markedly different from "Hindu roots" are to be wished away. In reality,  if there is to be ghar wapasi for adivasis, it would be to opt out of the increased Hinduisation of their traditions being pushed by RSS fronts like the Vanavasi Kalyan Parishad. In addition, the ghar wapsi programmes do raise the issue of continued caste discrimination and indignities against dalits. If dalits are considered unclean untouchables and are prohibited to enter the holy sanctum sanctorum of temples like the Nathdwara temple, then their conversion to religions they consider more equal are no more forced than was Babsaheb Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism.  His was the strongest indictment of the hated caste system, equally relevant today given the virulence of continued caste-based violence. The hypocrisy  of the ceremony of washing the feet of those " coming home" is only matched by the outrageous washing of temple premises after a dalit enters it, as the Bihar Chief Minister recently experienced. In the BJP-ruled states, anti-conversion laws target Christian and Muslim conversions while so-called home comings or even more crudely named "shuddhikaran" or "purification" programmes are routinely held under the benign gaze of the law. It started in earnest in 1996 under the leadership of BJP strongman Dilip Singh Judeo of Chattisgarh, who organized such programmes among Christian tribal communities leading to communal hostility and tension in adivasi areas. There are numerous cases filed against Christian missionaries for " forcible conversions" in these States but not a single case against ghar wapsi organisers. When the RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat, echoed by BJP Chief Amit Shah and Ministers like Venkaiah Naidu in Parliament, challenges the opposition political parties to accept a national anti- conversion law, first let them answer whether they include ghar wapasi as forcible conversion. Let them answer: will they uphold Article 25 of the Constitution of India  which specifically protects " freedom of conscience" and "free profession, practice and propagation of religion"?The RSS and its various fronts do not accept the basic secular structure of India with equal rights to all citizens and with specific protections to minorities. India is not and will never be a theocratic State. But with its aggressive campaign for Hindu rashtra, that is the agenda of the RSS. There is nothing new in this. From Savarkar to Golwarkar to Mohan Bhagwat, the language and the aim is the same. The freedom struggle rejected the divisive slogans of the RSS and it was the unity of the people which freed India from British Rule. India's constituent assembly while framing India's constitution once again rejected the RSS' sectarian view of India and its history. For 68 years, India has maintained its secular character. If Mohan Bhagwat makes headlines today, it is because he and his organization, have, courtesy the Prime Minister, direct access to State power. It is for this reason that the demand that the Prime Minister should make his mind known on the forcible conversions in the name of ghar wapasi through a statement in Parliament. At a time when India's constitution is under challenge, his silence is deafening.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            Secular Hindus will tolerate any attempt to plug the right of Muslims or Christians to convert us as part of their religious practices, constitution guarantees that. We wont allow the reverse to take place as well.

                            India under this government is doomed. We will be left a fragmented country, divided by what has torn most countries apart and left no signs of progress: Religion. Modi has hurt the sentiments of the peace loving community of Christians. If, like he claims, they are a mere 3 percent, what is he so afraid of? We were under the impression every citizen is important in India, but unfortunately, not in a Modis India.

                            You are a communist. No religion for you, lady. In fact, in communist nations, people pray within their 4 walls in fear that the state police will come and crack down on them. This is India. Everyone is free to practice his/her religion, including even groups like the Aghoris. You talk about tribals?? The tribal customs have survived only because they are part of a broad circle of Hinduism. We can worship a white Vishnu and a black Shivlinga or Krishna. We can worship a goddess like Durga as well as someone smeared with blood and bones like Kali. Would you have liked to see what would have happened to these tribals once they turn muslim or christian? Can they worship their Kali or stone idol as well as Allah and God? Brinda madam, Hindus can bow before Buddha, go to a dargah, or visit a Gurudwara. In fact, the first born son in all Hindu families during Guru Nanak's time was given to the Sikh faith. Can you think what would have happened if Guru Nanak had tried to propagate a new faith in an islamic majority land? You think anyone would be giving his first born away to him? Brinda dear, Islamists and Christians have converted (and are still converting) and now the Hindus are also converting some of them back. You, being part of the dying communist party, pl concentrate on reviving your gasping-for-breath party. Don't worry too much about religion. As a communist, it is unbecoming of you and talking about religion is blasphemy for your party.

                            Brinda Karat, DON'T WORRY! IT WILL BALANCE OUT SOON. Where were YOU PEOPLE when massive conversion drives by islamic(Saudi money) and christians missionaries(Western money) taking place. Can't understand these fake secular's approach of yours, the liberal minds are also now conscious to the fact that some religious zealots were taking advantage of our secular approach for a long time now. The silence by these groups now is a telling tale! The conversion law is a ploy played by these right wingers to highlight the SCREWUP process of ours. Brinda, we are as much responsible for the current crisis.

I am an atheist but very proud of my Indian culture and heritage that has been destroyed by her kind. They are all worried as they have stayed in power by dividing India and getting votes from so called "minorities". If you divide a people in a large number of very small sections, everyone becomes the minority. So, who is not a minority - Brahmins, Rajputs, Punjabies, Tamils, ...

                            Brinda Karat like all Leftists makes the mistake of believing their own lies. For the more historically well-informed, yes, Adivasis, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and the whole gamut of sects that call themselves Hindus have all lived and died in the subcontinent. While there have been pressures from Vedic Hinduism (the sort the Sangh is made out to stand up for), that is not a one off or peculiar only to Vedic Hinduism (or more appropriately Brahminical Hinduism). In all periods of the subcontinent's history there has seen political pressures and counter-ideologies ruling the roost in different parts: Shaivism in the South and Kashmir, Bhakti (Vaishnava, Shaivas and Shaktas) cults in the South, NE and East, Buddhism in the East and in the far North West, Jainism in the West and Central India, tribalism is still popular in large pockets of Central, SE, East, and NE India, and most recently Sikhism in the NW. The key commonality has been their roots indigenous to the territory of the subcontinent.<br/><br/>
What is wrong, and ultimately questionable in the spread of Abrahamic faiths is their total disconnect from the subcontinent vis-a-vis politics, culture and history. All of them are essentially of Middle Eastern origin (or in the case of Catholicism and Evangelical/Protestant Christianity of Roman/European origins). Here in lies the problem and the issues of how these 'faiths' are spreading. They always need force, soul-saving, monetary and/or economic benefits for the convert to proceed. In case of Catholicism it was Iberian ruthlessness, in case of Islam it was Arab/Persian/Mughal/Turkic butchery and bigotry (looting and destruction of temples, murder of priests, rape and enslavement of women and children) and economic pressures (jizya, unequal taxation, outright thuggery and loot of lands and property, etc.)<br/><br/>
For example: to say that "Islam is for peace" is hilarious, when all records, including Islamic historical chronicles show that the sufis came into the picture after the prevailing socio-political structures were utterly destroyed in invasions, be it Shah Hamadani in Kashmir (post-the Mir Dynasty's butchery, followed by Sikandar Butshikan)'s, or Shah Jalal in Bengal (post-Bakhtiyar Khilji's butchery and rape). And the reality, is for all to see in any case, in the Koran's precepts, and the bloodbath on in the Middle East and Pakistan.<br/><br/>
There is no spirituality in Abrahamic faiths, and whatever cultural precepts they carry have nothing to do with the subcontinent's history. 90% of Christians and Muslims in the subcontinent violate the basic tenets of Christianity and Islam anyway, because they don't identify with the precepts. The remaining 10% are doing the rounds trying to Arabize or Semitize or Europeanize Indians/Pakistanis.<br/><br/>
Their time is up, the Hindus (that epitome of diversity of faith the likes of which the Middle East or Europe will never see), have decided that they are better off by themselves instead of importing rubbish ideals of butchery and bloodbath born in the deserts. Karat and her friends will be soon forgotten and buried, till then they can continue reading their own made-up histories where "Aryans come from Central Asia, and Dravidians come from Africa". The rest of us can and will bring the misled into the mainstream, we all know their souls don't need harvesting for some jealous "god".

Hinduism accommodates and respects ( not just tolerates ) other religions . Hinduism believes that God can be worshipped in any form , by any name . It is with this background , that India is a Hindu rashtra . Madam ! Please go beyond politics , understand the culture and history of your country beyond the British definitions .

                            I am against any conversion except it is a genuine choice of the individual. However, we Hindus also should look at the way some sections of Hindu community like dalits are treated. If a person and his children are treated worse than an animal, insulted everyday, not allowed to live with dignity how long will he feel proud to be a called Hindu? Put yourself in his shoes and think how will you feel if you have to see your children being treated worse than dogs. Look at the faults of Hinduism today before blaming others. Finally, how will the  families who are "Home coming" to Hinduism be treated? Will the the higher classes of Hinduism like Brahmins or Kshratriyas or Vaishyas be prepared to accept them as equal to themselves or they will be treated like other dalits and how long this home coming last in that situation?

                            I don't know why Indian politicians came into this try to create a war that is religious.  Why these politicians want to create a atmosphere in Indian Society that every Indian face a some amount of fear in order to follow his faith and traditions. <br/><br/>
When some leader(specially congress but not excluding others) call for values of some small amount of people then I being Hindu seems to be left out and the i found my faith and values is actually being saved by RSS. Is something wrong in that i don't think so. again this is my personal thought.<br/><br/>
If conversions are ok then re-conversion has to be ok. either both are not ok.<br/><br/>
I request to all leader of Parliament, not to make this issue a national issue there are other national issues which need to be addressed immediately.

                            @:Seriously...are you really so oblivious of the Christian church funding of mass conversions in tribal belts of India ? Do you think these tribals who have lived in harmoney with nature for so long suddenly got attracted to Christianity for no reason other than love of Jesus? How did Assam become a Christian majority state? Please educate yourself about the history of christianity and its legacy of mass conversions and mass murder of those who did not believe in Christ. Christians in India have thrived because of the tolerance of Hindus and "Sarva Dharma Sambhaav" principles that we are taught. The so called minorities hate the majority Hindu "non-believers" and think that we will go to hell...so stop blabbering nonsense. Also, we are a billion+ strong nation and 3% is a huge massive number. Its time that the definition of minority be revisited, a mere percentage is not a true reflection of minority status in a country like India. Parsi's are the true minority with dwindling numbers and they are nowhere protesting about any injustice while the the followers of two biggest religions on the world (Christianity and Islam) continue to crib and whine at the drop of a hat.

                            Brinda Karat's heroes are mass murderers like Stalin, the Soviet despot. It is high hypocrisy for her to write this article even as she embraces a political philosophy that has been responsible for the murder of millions of humans, major free speech excesses, and continues to be responsible for the muzzling of over a billion today.<br/><br/>
She has the right to say what she wants, of course, but the prudent course would be for readers to ignore everything she says.

                            I am surprised why people dont seem to understand what RSS is trying to do. The anti-conversion law is against our constitution. Please refer to the right to religion section of our constitution. The RSS is only trying to be in the good books by saying that they want to launch the anti-conversion law. This will destroy the communal fabric of our nation. During congress rule, there might have been terrible corruption, but we never had any communal harmony problems. <br/><br/>
The government is trying to fool you by making you believe that the RSS and the VHP and the BJP are like different organisations while they are exactly the same. While Dr Manmohan Singh was controlled by Sonia Gandhi, our current PM is controlled by the RSS heads.<br/><br/>
Also, I happen to be born a Hindu and hence am. And having been to so many religious places, i think i understand who are those people(hindus) who convert to other religions. They are people who are not allowed to enter our temples despite being hindus. They are people who are looked down upon for being of some low caste which is sad. These are the people who actually convert so they can go to a church or mosque to pray which they are denied. But they are doing so of their own will and not forced to do so.<br/><br/>
Think people. We are all indians and all indians should be regarded as first grade citizens. Do not fall into the trap.

Exactly the point Brinda Karat !! Is this applicable only to the Minorities? Is the Majority not covered under this article of the constitution ? Aren't they allowed to practice and propagate their religion ?<br/><br/>
You are after all a Communist who do not believe in religion. You are just making a political point since you simply hate the BJP and Mr.Modi.<br/><br/>
You and are ideology are outdated and the proof is shown to you on your face by the people who have voted ( and to be more clear.. THEY DID NOT VOTE FOR YOU )

                            Countless Hindus have been converted into Christianity by allurement . This is a well known fact . Secondly , Please understand the sanskriti of a Hindu rashtra. Hinduism accommodates and respects ( not just tolerates ) other religions . Hinduism believes that God can be worshipped in any form , by any name . It is with this background , that India is a Hindu rashtra . Madam ! Please go beyond politics , understand the culture and history of your country beyond the British definitions .

                            If conversion becomes a crime, will reconversion also be considered a crime? If people want to be enticed by another religion for economic benefit or some other benefit, why should the law object to that? After Ghar-wapsi, will we still go by the caste system or will be consider the "returnees" as upper class Hindus? Does it mean that if a person is being persecuted for his caste he must stay as a Hindu because it is what he was born as and now a one-way street for him/her.Please answer. It is my birthright to decide/choose. Will the law take away this one right that I have?

                            Let us first of all put Brinda's allusion to Hitler in perspective: Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, like Brinda a Bengali was Hitler's guest for more than 12 months. Why no condemnation from her?  Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, grandfather of Congress stalwart Captain Arminder Singh visited Hitler together with 50 of his chamchas and bestowed upon him gifts of the most expensive diamonds in the world.  This was at the very time Indians were starving to death. Why no condemnation from Brinda?  It was this same Bhupinder Singh, incidentally, who SUPPORTED the British action in butchering hundreds of Indians during the infamous Jalianwalla Bagh massacre.  Now let us put Brinda into perspective: This is the same Brinda who got a plum posting to London in the early 70s, to work in the Air India Office, situated in the poshest part of London.  Brinda obviously did not feel the need to lift the Indian poor out of poverty through her 'communist' activities.  Why bother working in the slums of Calcutta when London obviously needed her communism more!!  That said, why is Brinda now poking her nose into matters of religion?  Doesn't her communist party decree atheism for all?  Her hero, Karl Marx said, way back in 1843 that 'Religion is the opium of the people' and I am sure our little Brinda will not wish the great Indian public to consume opium, be it Hindu, Islamic or even Christian opium!  It is this Marx whose name features in Brinda's political party!  Brinda now shedding crocodile tears for the alleged attacks on the Indian Constitution and under it the freedom to practice any religion is going way over the top.  There is not now and there never has been any hint of practicing any religion under coercion.  People have a choice as to their religion and this choice may well be informed by the school they attend.  After all, didn't our Brinda attend Welham Girls' School, named after a Welsh village despite India having gained Independence 10 years before that school was founded?  Did anybody stop her from imbibing the rubbish such 'elite' schools impart upon Brinda and her Ilk?  Obviously not! Thereafter, didn't little Brinda go on to Miranda College, founded and so named after India gained Independence?  Why, the foundation stone was even laid by Nehru's mistress, Edwina Mountbatten!  So, Brinda, people in India are free to do pretty much as they please as long as they are not interfering in the freedom of others to exercise THEIR freedom of action.  The last thing the people of India, be they the peasants or the proletariat (note the favourite words of communists)need is the proselytization (note the religious connotation of that word) from our Brinda who has had an elite school education, elite college education, elite employment opportunities and indeed an elite life!  Brinda has probably never met a 'common' man in her life!  Being a 'Champaign Communist' she would have no time as the guzzling of all that Champaign AND spewing articles full of the sort of rubbish that NDTV publishes would leave little or no time for Brinda to live in the real world.  And please Prime Minister Modi; your silence is not deafening, we hear you loud and clear.  Little Brinda needs a deaf aid (preferably made in Communist China).

                            OK madam Karat. Your point has been made though not accepted in view of the proof otherwise. A look at the demography of India in the religious context between the 1951~2011 period of recorded census shows that Hindus have shrunk from 85&gt;79.6% (Decline of 6.35%)of the population. This is in contrast to the sharp gains made by Muslims (from 9.9% to 14.2% a solid  increase of 43.43%)and good gains by Christians (from 2% to 2.34% an increase of 17%). All other minorities (with the exception of Jains who show marginal decline and Parsis who have diminished due to different reasons)have shown handsome gains. Now the victim trying to protect its flock is branded extremist by madam Karat. Secular democracy means equal respect for all and not at the expense of the majority.

                            when I was a student in Germany 3 people came to our student shared house asking about my plans. then they were praising about Jesus. ya it is all good. after our talk they went to other houses to induce more people.  interesting thing is they entered only Hindu Indian srilankan houses. they didn't go to turkish Pakistan I or Nigerian or egyptians flat. they knew Hindus will welcome anyone into their house. <br/><br/>
after  a month same people came again they asked if we did read those bibles.<br/><br/>
we asked why in Europe the people below 60s do not go to church and on Sundays why only less than 10 people comes for prayer.<br/><br/>
they were stunned... no answers. e told them to leave our house and do brainwash to u r  own European teenagers to mid 50s people. at least u can work to bring their faith back.<br/><br/>
That never worked. so globally Hindus  are faithful to anything and they can. donate to religious place. so after loosing hopes in Western countries they do that in India

                            Why is Communism on the wane in state after state in India? It appears that the "intellectual" communist leaders shy away from doing ground work and are very happy sitting and writing utopian theories for the masses. It is high time that leadership change takes place in Communist Parties of India. The young, tech savvy, broadminded youngsters who understand present day global economic realities should take charge from outdated oldies, who do not want to change with times.

Isnt that a noise pollution? Is there any law of hunting other religion by money...now result is left over minority hindus may be some hundreds are now stringent and strict in that areas..eg swami asimanand..y this is happening??

                            It is the Communist Party whose major funding is from the Christian Community and to hold the dignity of the 'Anna-data' is a Indian Tradition which is being taken-up seriously by Brindaji. India has been given a secular fabric from outside but it in reality it is the political gaming of Congress and other cheap parties who only want to rule over the majority by suppressing them and just be friendly to all the minorities and getting their support.

                            It is a fact that for example in Chandigarh people are being converted in hopes of getting their kids and grand-kids into leading convent schools and later colleges. The foreign embassies/consulates are aware but looking the other way as they are mainly Christian countries. The Archbishop of Shimla and Chandigarh should be asked to explain as should the BJP MP for Chandigarh.

                            All those who are making so much noise against the debatable "ghar wapasi" program seems to have just landed in India, because they seems to be totally unaware of religious conversions that has been happening for decades now. Or maybe conversion from a particular religion to any other religion cannot be termed "conversion" !! Double standards, surprisingly the Media is acting as torch bearer of hypocrisy.

                            If you believe these things are wrong , why your party running away from parliament and repeatedly and what you failed to present the proof of your belief to the police and get the perpetrators behind bar. Why not regulate missionary , madrasa &amp; temples and force them to be accountable for nation and to the society via regulations. End this once for all. This conversion is creating demographic imbalance in the society &amp; is biggest problem for various govts social welfare schemes.

                            Let all religions be damned. They bring out nothing but hatred amongst people. Religion should be banned. So many are concerned about being hindu or muslim or christians or what ever but nobody has bothered to check and comment upon the pitiable conditions under which these people live. Does it really matter if these people go to temple or church or mosque????? Does it really matter to these so called saviors of religion if these people live or die!!!!!!!! THINK. You wont find even one positive in religion. And for God's sake, don't equate religion with God. God has nothing to do with religion.

Bringing anti conversation law, you are punishing people who wants to change their religion by their own intellectual and will. It's would be same foolishness like burkha should be compulsory in gulf countries. World would laugh on us like we do at gulf.

                            Brinda, Let Golwalkar and Bhagwat be, just tell us why should conversion be a one way street? because it suits your vote bank? If a Hindu can convert to a musli/christian then why can he or some one who's born christian or a muslim not get the same privilege of conversion when they seek? If yes then arent they providing a way to keep up the Article 25?<br/><br/>
About Mamata booking anyone under 153a, let her and her cronies (and for that matter you leftists) stop making foot in the mouth retarded comments on Tv and public forums that can be charged under the same section. Last I checked 153a did not differentiate in terms of Political bent of mind<br/><br/>
If you choose to speak on history and idealogy , you political career is rooted in an idealogy that stood by China in the sino-indian war and your leader(CPIMarxist) were responsible for what happened in Naxalbari that continues to bleed the country today. <br/><br/>
Your illegitimate offsprings, the Naxals have bled India that can put ISI to shame let alone the "hindu fascists".<br/><br/>
India got her freedom because an impending Economical doom over the british in the wake of WW2 and its aftermath, left right or centrist had squat to do with it.<br/><br/>
But I do have to commend you that you did manage to complete your demented notions without once mentioning a link between Gandhi's assassination and the RSS, this is what your types usually thrive upon, atleast you respect the courts.Kudos!

                            "...structure of India with equal rights to all citizens and with specific protections to minorities."  this sentence sums up it all....every one is equal but minorities are better. <br/><br/>
India's secularism and equal rights:<br/>
- Hindu temples and properties under the control of Govt. Mosques and Churches and their income belong to the Muslims and Christians.<br/>
- Minorities educational institutions can admit 100% minorities, can self-administer, and also openly propagate Islam and Christianity. Majority run educational institutions cannot admit all of them, and cannot even talk about Hinduism.<br/>
- Its an open secret Christian institutions and hospitals strategy is to operate where people are most vulnerable.Its not uncommon that children and even college students in Christian institutions are taught Christian prayers (I was in my school), and given Bibles. All hospitals have Churches, when people feel most vulnerable when their loved ones are sick, best way to convince them. I know for a fact that some of my friends were told to specifically convert should they desire an admission in their institution. Some converted.<br/>
- A case in point, one of our workers had a Hindu name. On Sunday he did not come to work as agreed. On asking why, he said he went to Church to sign and he gets Rs. 50 for it. These signatures are sent abroad so that the coordinator can collect Dollars/Euros. <br/>
- One of a convert in my street bought a house and couple of cars in converting others.Where does the money come from? how does he being a Christian missionary can earn that rapidly.<br/><br/>
Well, I have never seen such hue and cry for millions of conversions, and here is the Parliament disrupted and everyone is screaming their life off for few tens of conversions. As a Hindu, I feel the most unsafe in India. And this is my motherland, and Hindus' only land. God save Hindus and I am just a common man.

                            Marxists/Communist ideologues are deeply hostile to religions in general, and even more so to Eastern religions that challenge their highly Eurocentric ideas of 'progress' and science/religion dichotomy. Many across Europe and the Western world are turning to eastern religions and spiritual philosophies to find meaning and purpose amidst all the moral chaos, violence and fragmentation that industrialism has created. <br/>
However, the Marxisit/Communist ideologues continue to speak/write as if this the 19th century when European colonial arrogance and parochialism was at its peak.

                            the bitter truth behind so called ghar wapsi is hundreds of thousands of dalits and adiwasi indians have been converted by christian missionaries mostly by allurement. and there was no stopping for the conversions because it was a win win deal for Dalits, and adiwasis to upgrade there caste and come out of the clutches of untouchability and stigma, which is still prevalent in most parts of the country. the Sangh parivar was well aware of the facts and wanted to rise this issue in a big way to garner support for bringing in legislation to stop this. they chose Agra to flareup the issue and chose poor Muslim community because India has a very good business relation with mostly christian Europe and America and  did not wanted to drive away investments from these countries and they chose agra because they want to keep the society in UP  polorised atleast till next vidhansabha elections.

3lakhs to christians &amp; 5 lakhs to muslims to convert &amp; some times this gangsters threatens poor to convert or face violence. This news is international &amp; no body will invest in India,even Israeli will n't invest, so forget the groth,job creation &amp; prosparity,yes one thing is sure is the communal riots &amp; insecurity. BJP will be devided in two groups, one with RSS &amp; VHP &amp; BAJRANGDAL,one independent.

                            So what you mean is that they were converted by choice and reconverted back to hinduisim by force. What a lame excuse. Why would someone convert to any religion in first place.

                            Madam , there are 5 straight questions.<br/>
1.It is reconversion, answer me how they converted to christianity/islam ?<br/>
  is it because of that faith or any force/maipulation done?<br/>
2.why no one ask about the conversions from hindu to other faiths. and how are christians getting money to build a church in each and every village when their population is so less?<br/>
3. why i can't i talk about my faith, if i do people start calling me as RSS fellow.?<br/>
4. You never talked about what happened to hindus in kashmir and bengal.<br/>
   why are you raising your voice now?<br/>
5. there are numerous temples destroyed till today in pakistan, you never talk about it. but when babri masid demolition( i accept it is wrong) happened you will go any extent to support them. why?

                            Do the people who were converted or are easy targets for the so called conversion (irrespective of religion) care about religion. I guess not. All they need is food, shelter and other basic necessities to live (maybe not as comfortable as ours). Why cant the politicians of this country just focus on these issues? Improve the quality of life across the board. Quality education for all. Security for women. Arent these issues worthy enough for not just debates and articles? Mr Modi held promise and still does if everyone including BJP plus all the opposition cooperates. The agenda has to be development and not issues pertaining to religion, communal stuff etc...

                            Dear Mam,<br/>
RSS has been talking this language since ages. Why this sudden importances to them ? U belong to party that is supposed to have honest politicans. How is that you support corrupt political parties like the congress and TMC ? Why is that you no longer speak about corruption. People in this country have been converted from Hindus to Muslims / Christians by lure and money power since many years. You'll know this truth. RSS has also been working doing so called shudhikaran / or now termed as ghar-vapsi since many years. <br/>
What is wrong to put a legal process for any conversion / re-conversion. Once we have a legal process, then it is upto an indiviual when he wants to convert or re-convert. Only if a person has a legal paper he / she should be allowed to go through any ritual. When we are able to register all vehicles in this country, it is possible to achieve this process. Why opposse a strong law on anti -conversion and stall work in Parliment. Please undertsand you are wasting tax payers, hard enarned money in your tamasha. U are pro-people, that is what u say. Do you not see that the development of the people of this country is what you are stalling ? why are you not asking for a legal procedure if you so belive that people are re-converting by the use of force. Any statment needs to be backed with legal document truth. Just screeming and shouting in and outside parliment means nothing. take the matter to court, hope you belive in the judicial system in India. Stop this APP style of protest on roads /street. Today the world is watching us, lets behave as a civilised society.
