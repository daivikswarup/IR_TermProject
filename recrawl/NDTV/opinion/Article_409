Headline::::2 Major Take-Aways for BJP from Delhi



DateTime::::2015-02-10T23:02:00+05:30



(The writer is a political columnist, a lapsed historian and a committed conservative.)
	Â 
	When a ruling party fails to accomplish a political mission, the impact of the setback tends to be severe. Had the BJP narrowly lost the Delhi election to the Aam Aadmi Party, there would have been reverberations, but they would have been limited to three or four days of televised taunts. Unfortunately for it, the drubbing it received on Tuesday morning has been so decisive that the fallout of a local defeat may be far larger than initially anticipated.
	Apart from the media-with which the Narendra Modi Government has always had an awkward relationship-gloating over the discomfiture of both the Prime Minister and BJP president Amit Shah, the BJP's debacle in Delhi has given the national opposition a rush of adrenalin. The psychological effect of AAP's conclusive victory cannot be underestimated. The fledgling political outfit that promised, among other things, a dose of "new politics" that included cheaper public amenities and free Wi-Fi, has demonstrated that the BJP's unrelenting advance can be checked. Modi has not been crippled but the chinks in the BJP armour have been exposed.
	The BJP can perhaps take nominal comfort in the fact that it was the en-masse shift of erstwhile Congress and BSP votes to AAP that shaped the magnitude of Arvind Kejriwal's victory. But this statistical consolation prize is offset by some larger questions. Why, the BJP should be asking itself, did the orphaned voters of the Congress and BSP drift to AAP? More important, why did the younger voters who supported Modi so enthusiastically in the 2014 general election drift away from BJP less than a year later?
	To be fair, the victorious AAP leadership has been circumspect in triumph. Despite incessant prodding by the media, it has shied away from projecting its Delhi victory as Modi's Stalingrad. Having been grievously wounded in the past by reckless over-extension, it seems inclined to focus its energies on making Delhi a laboratory of its 'new politics'. Taking on Modi in frontal combat is an approach it would, for the moment, like to avoid.
	This is just as well. Kejriwal and his team appear to have digested the lessons of its 49-day experience when it plunged into a bout of confrontational politics. The promise of five years of Kejriwal incorporated the assurance of change through responsible politics.
	Not that this exemplary show of restraint is likely to inhibit the other opposition parties from trying to convert BJP's Delhi defeat into a full-scale declaration of war against the Modi government. The coming Budget session of Parliament is almost certain to see elements of the still-divided Janata Parivar and the beleaguered Trinamool Congress form a no-hold-barred opposition to the government's economic policies. The Congress, which should actually be seriously concerned over its rapidly disappearing electoral base, will probably join the melee-seeing it as an alternative to addressing uncomfortable issues centred on its own political failings.
	The real attention is, however, likely to be on Modi's own response to the Delhi defeat. The easy way would be for the BJP leadership to blame the decimation on tactical misjudgements and an inept local leadership. That would be a cop out.
	The Delhi election has shown that the appeal of the BJP has dulled on two counts.
	First, there are growing murmurs against the slow arrival of the much anticipated achche din. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the complaint 'nothing has really changed' sullied the mood against the BJP and added to the charms of the change promised by AAP.
	Secondly, the wild utterances of the extremist fringe have derailed the political narrative of the Modi government. In Delhi, this triggered the en-masse consolidation of Muslims, Christians and people from North-East India against the BJP. Equally, it made the appeal of the BJP lukewarm to the youth and a section of the middle classes.
	In Delhi, the BJP ended up angering too many social constituencies and ended up with just its core vote. Unfortunately for it, the core vote cannot win elections.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            If Arvind can come back..Modiji will bounce back. I welcome the result as it is the best for Indian democracy. In long run the most to gain from this result is BJP as this will accelerate the decay of Congress.

                            Make sure this analysis is seen by Mr Modi. Even me, a hardcore bjp supporter was shocked at guys like sakshi maharaj, etc etc talking crap. vhp etc are loonies but our pm should tell them to shut up and get out. And time to throw out shiv sena. NCP is anyday better. PDP and bjp should now get along

                            I feel this a signal lesson not only for the BJP but for all parties. BJP leadership got the following wrong: 1. People want an accessible and humble leadership not a muscular I know all leadership. 2. This business of Garh Waspi and damage to Churches etc. the PM and the top leadership should have denounced it even before people ask because BJP carries a baggage of being not secular which BJP might be feeling is a opposition construct even if it is you have to carry the cross till you prove in no uncertain terms that BJP is secular beyond doubt which over a period of time will expose the opposition bluff. 3. BJP has failed to rein in the right wing fringe elements ( Hindu Fundamentalist) making all sort statement that i consider not Hindu at all in fact shaming Hinduism, This has resulted in the minorities suspecting BJP leaderships real intent. 4. Last but not the least Government has been making all sort of noise about development but nothing seems to be happening except for for lot of fanfare high quality exhibition of some plan etc. the common man is not feeling the good effect of so called good governance and the taking forward of the slogan of every Indian together will work together for the everyone's progress and development (that is yet to happen). People are impatient. Modi and his team will have to walk the talk and shift to overdrive and deliver showing tangible results on the ground. If they do not do that they can forget Bihar , West Bengal and other places.

                            BASICALLY BJP &amp; CONG DOES NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE REAL PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC. BJP WAS MORE INTERESTED IN 10 BABIES FOR EACH WOMAN, GODSE TEMPLE AND SERVING AMBANI, ADANI AND INCREASING MEDICINE PRICES 4 TIMES . CONG IS IN SLLEP MODE AFTER LOK SABHA THRASHING. PEOPLE WANT GOOD LIFE AND DEVELOPMENT ZERO CORRUPTION

                            My son has an exam, I teach him everything make him practice all possible questions. In the exam he ends up committing a lot of mistakes. Should I reprimand him, think there some mistake in my teaching, should I think he is not capable no matter how I teach him. Modiji, has to find out answers to above questions.  I am a hard core supporter of Modi's approach to development. Its time to deliver. Modiji when Hard core supporters start questioning, it a very clear indication that a very hard introspection is the order of the day. Congrats Kejriwal, but please do not blow our hard earning taxes as freebies.

                            A) In Delhi, BJP did many non-reversible strategic mistakes in last phase of elections which allow AAP to completely sweep voter's mind : 1. Announcing non-political faces as CM n last 15 days and without proper evaluation of her fitment as a political leader 2. Not take local unit into confidence before announcing CM name 3. Highly negative campaign against main AK 4. Not to speak about development (which is brand image of Modi) in campaign<br/><br/>
B) Besides last crucial mistakes, BJP did few mistakes from very beginning which allowed AAP to  set-up platform to create hype (which swept BJP in last crucial face)<br/>
1. Delhi's local unit's overconfidence 2. Late start of campaign (BJP started campaign from Jan 2015 only while AAP started its campaign from Oct 2014) 3. Late dissolved of Delhi assembly which allowed AAP to re-organise its party <br/><br/>
C) Also completely wash-out of Congress &amp; other parties in favor of AAP. Which increase leads so heavily that election became completely one way. The way BJP thrash Congress, same way AAP defeated BJP

                            Shivji..In democracy any one can comeback, when BJP can grow from 2 to 272, why cannot Congress grow from 44 to higher levels. It is matter of time and mood of the people in this country. One thing is clear from recent political developments, no vote for non-performance and bhashan.

                            Modi needs to show openly development agenda. we know many projects are under pipe line and work already started but modi do not want to announce it since most of those projects were just initiated by congress government but never too off. so BJP did not want to give any details about the move of modi government. reg secularism, it is not a issue in big way for hindus as they know this and do not bother about this. otherwise APP would have talked about secularism before elections and after results came. AK never said about ghar vapsi,conversion,church attacks but played a cool silence to get the hindu votes which were consolidated earlier by BJP for parliamentary elections. only muslims and christians even otherwise they would have voted for Congress like before the same way they did during 2014 general elections. They would not have voted for BJP even otherwise.<br/>
But modi could have said some words about the church attacks ( engineered by missionaries and strike organised by them to malign BJP and ensured Obama made this reference about secularism just one day before the elections. APP had a secret hand in this and same way they played game with Imam asking muslims to vote for APP but immediately denied by AK which is a masterstroke to get hindu votes also. APP worked for 9 months with young blood but BJP brought supporters from other states and brought a lady who just joined the party thereby ignoring to the displeasure of local BJP leaders. Modi and Amit shaw has to learn lot from this lesson. But one consolation is that BJP did not lose its traditional votes. same percentage of votes it secured like in general election for loksabha in delhi during 2014. i e 33% with just one pct drop now. This debacle happened just in 8 months which is good for them to learn the mistakes and plan for future.

                            Swapan - you forgot few more things - very importantly vote share. The whole of Muslims who earlier were divided between congress and AAP - this time went to AAP in bulk - perhaps the appeal by Bukharee worked in favor of AAP. BJP has failed to meet the expectation of Muslims and I doubt that will change in near future. Also BJP fell in the same trap like congress during the LOK sabha election of running negative campaign. Delhi voters were largely sympathetic to Arvind then impatient with the acche deen. I really doubt Amit Shah is real strategist - who could not see this simple fact of how people react to such attacks. More over with some stupid members of BJP (along with PM's silence) has now landed into a situation where every other party can create a communal incident - and media and public would be so quick to blame BJP for that. They need to find a way to deal with all this now.

                            For BJP elections and democracy mean just to protect the interest of rich businessman and industralist in the pretex of economic development. <br/>
But in democracy Government has to treat all section of society and citizens equal whether farmers, workers, traders, industrialist and businessman. But BJP has only agenda for one society to protect interest priviledged class those are rich people. <br/>
For poor and needy people BJP's nationalism and intellectullism oppose freebees through subsidy but BJP want subsidy and subsidised mechanism to benefit rich industralist and businessman by grabbing land of farmers class in the pretex of development agenda which is favaratism and nepotism and croni capitalism.<br/>
Now, public understand he modinomics better and BJP agenda of governance to protect the interest of rich and higher middle class and teach poor with ideological sermon how subsidy for poor is bad economics but same subsidy and favouratism to capitalist is good economics.

                            Actually Mr Modi &amp; Shah should, with the utmost thanks and humility, thank Mr Kejriwal and AAP for bringing them back to the ground (nevertheless with a big thud!) and giving them a chance to (re)learn valuable lessons for the greater political combats in future. But for the prestige issue Delhi is not a very big political landscape vis-a-vis Bihar, Up, bengal etc. Imagine the BJP going into these big elections with the same overbearing mindset and strategies; it probably would have suffered a n irredeemable political disaster. The AAP has given them valuable time to look within and at all their policies and strategies; and if they do that the BJP would have come out much wiser (&amp;stronger) after this debacle. I am sure that the BJP and Mr Modi are humble enough to sincerely accept his failings and make the necessary course corrections. In the starkest adversity there is often the ray of great merit!

                            We don't need analysis to understand the failure of Modi wave. It was only few things which janta did not like and it was all in the air to smell; lots of personal attack even by Modi on aam admi, height of arrogance as if they are the custodians of pseudo-nationalists certificate givers, failure to deliver what is promised, loose canons in Modi's team who are hate monger custodians of hinduism -"Sakshi making selfie in himalaya and talking he is a powerful man who can topple government, Yogi speeching the language of terrorist "you kill 1 we will kill 100". Modi's self inflated selfie lifestyle and expensive 10 lakhs suit showing his megalomaniac nature, given that the people supported him on his modest background. Hope a lesson is learned by BJP and only development issues can survive them, otherwise the tsunami of aam admi is in making to topple the government, should they only serve corporates and the riches.

                            Still it is not too late for the BJP to consolidate.  Of course Delhi has given a historic defeat to BJP.  First destabilize all fringe elements.  Take strict actions against all those who are involved in communal activities and even talks.  Please solve day-to-day problems of the common man like bringing down the prices of all essentail commodities and taking more care for women's safety etc., which were your manifesto before the Lok Sabha elections.  Even citizens like me who voted for the sake of modiji's administration alone was much disappointed for not implementing the promises made by the BJP.  But still we have a lot of faith in modiji.

                            What you write here is exactly what has hit BJP.  Ravishanker Prasad said yesterday what is more disturbing is that we could not read mood of people of delhi. he must know when you bulldoze from top and bring outsiders over your own cadre , they will silently revolt ; may give you wrong feedback/picture to teach the top brass a lesson. This is what has happened. <br/>
PM is slogan master , he loves company of Ambani brothers , adani ,etc super riches of India who are not viewed clean by people of the country. He talks of Gandhi ,Patel ; says he is messiah of the poor but changes 4 suits is a day, a designer kurta /pyjama every day different one ....this depicts his real side of personality. <br/>
this is what has been the revelation to people of the country in last 8 months..<br/>
As time will pass , real picture will stay more n more with wise people of this country...and then more corrections will come in political space.

                            Isn't it a good thing for the BJP that it's most vocal opponent,is going to be in power itself right in the capital, as a result of which (being in power) it will have a lot of explaining to do in coming years to do, no matter what they do.The promises they have made are impractical,the expectations astronomical.Will not the AAP serve the role of showing to the people that how good BJP actually is? WHen BJP critics, most of which are closet AAP supporters or former Congressi, will they not find themselves on slippary slope attacking BJP while defending AAP? Nature of being in power is, there will be opponents.Now opponents of BJP themselves will have lots of opponents. Will AAP be able to win states e.g U.P,on their own or will they  split anti BJP vote, when their popularity will be lesser but some support will be there? If they will align with likes of SP, they will lose their core appeal, if they don't , will they win other states or the center? Delhi was a different case where there was a single opposition. Just wait, BJP supporters are supporters from generations, they don't leave BJP, AAP's voter is itchy floating voter plus so called secular vote,they float ,they desert, they split, it's just arithmetic,sometimes it doesn't sum up in your favor, but thats ok, BJP is on the right path, it must consolidate its 31% Hindu vote plus add to it about 7-8%, with that kind of vote share it just needs to split the anti BJP vote, which AAP will help it to,then BJP is there to rule for decades to come.

                            Modi want to deliver the things after making the concrete ground work and should last long to future generation...e.g. electricity needs hard ground work  from poor labors, infrastructure, middle class and corporate funding. In contrary, this Kejriwal want to play on this ready made ground. He can pick the fruits easily from tree but let him to plant one tree give it free... let him to make promises like he will lay the canal line from water source(instead repairing/putting meter at the end user/giving free water), let him make promise like giving electricity by laying new lines, infrastructure and power generation (instead giving 50% subsidy). He is so clever that, not even single hard work promised by him. He understands cleverly that ground work will take time....people will not wait for that....

                            Very well said Swapan Da! Its actually the extremist fringe elements caused more damage to Modi Ji and BJP's image. Hindus like to live in peace and harmony with all the other relegions , BJP leaders appeared to be someone who is interested in disrupting this peaceful existence. These leaders as they have Z security cover but who will protect the common man.<br/><br/>
Secondly not a single reform of BJP have actaully materialised in terms of price rise, corruption or woman security.

                            BJP was defeated by AAP because they have an image of honest politicians and they promised many freebees for the poor. Middle class has great attraction for cleaner and corruption free politics and economic development. Modi and Bedi have an image of honest persons, but all other BJP leaders do not have that image. People have totally rejected Congress which has become synonymous to corruption. Corrupt politicians like Laloo, Nitish, Mulayam and Sonia's Congress etc are no match to BJP. They are trying to cobble up a casteist combination to win election and they are trying to give it a respectable name called Social Engineering. Unless a group of honest and capable politicians emerge nationwide, BJP will have its run.

                            Swapan Dasgupta should be praised for being candid. There is a precedent for many pro Ruling Party journalists getting into the Rajya Sabha. Balbir Punj and Chandan Mitra are only two recent such examples. SD on the other hand, seems to be squandering a similar chance by being critical of the current dispensation.<br/>
Good luck to him.

                            To me three things stood out for the AAP; one, they refrained from mud-slinging and jingoism; two, they addressed local issues and three, they went door-to-door with their declaration of intent --- this is what impacted the voter; full marks to their efforts!

                            I was a big fan of modi in 2013. But, series or non-secular comments by BJP made me change my mind. This does not mean I am fan for congress. I am completely anti-congress. Firstly, Non-secular comments from sushma swaraj, to make bhagawatgita a national book. Me being an hindu I simply hate this. Every religion on this earth should be treated equally, if they cannot treat just simply ignore. Make our constitution as national book. Everybody will welcome it. Secondly, comments like a hindu women should give birth to four children (one for army). This statement is absolute garbage. Nothing can be worse than this. It would have been little better if he stated indian women instead of hindu women. There are many other non-secular statements after bjp came to power. I am still a fan of modi for what he trying to do for development. But, most importantly he should understand that things should not slip further on religious issues.

                            Modi will not cooperate with Delhi CM Kejariwal. He is known for destroying political opponents. Modi has done that in Gujarat by converting congresses to BJP.

                            1 year back, BJP did not win, but the hope for growth and development won. Growth and development cannot come in 1-2 years. It needs careful planning for years involving mass people. Can you imagine the far reaching effect of poor people getting Bank A/c, doing white money transaction and getting subsidy in bank a/c in stead of standing in queue for discounted rice and kerosene? It is a huge huge transformation.<br/><br/>
I am confident that we will start seeing seeing the result after 2nd or 3rd year onwards which will take India to a next level in global level. Whether BJP or somebody else after 5 years, this momentum will continue. If we cannot belive in BJP, at least believe in ourselves.

                            This guy seems to be amongst the so call secular (actually sickular). While several of his points seem to be true, don't understand why these people have a problem on "ghar wapasi" and other agenda's of VHP, RSS and other parties. I have a few questions:<br/>
1) why are these people including the writer turning a blind eye to tha fact that conversions (from Hindu to christian from Hindu to  Islam) happening on large scale at Kerala, Tamil nadu and many more states? Are they turning a blind eye or is it that they do have the guts to talk about these?<br/>
2) who says the Muslims are in minority? Will we ever get the actual census as these people do not allow the ' Jana ganana ' people to actually tally their family numbers<br/><br/>
It is well known that an internal enemy is more dangerous than an external one...and I am sure many of our so called secular people like Mulayam, Laloo, mamata, Rahul, Sonia and the writers like above are far more dangerous...<br/><br/>
Development along with internal security (screwed by congress govt.) should be on the agenda, which the BJP government is trying to follow.

                            Mr. Dasgupta, I hope you won't mind if I am as frank with you as you are in your comments. You describe yourself as a committed conservative which is meaningless in India. It may be alright in the U.S or the UK but sounds strange in a country where the majority of the population lives in such dire poverty - in filth and in slums. Even Kirin Bedi said that she was greatly struck by the contrast of wealth and poverty when she visited the various constituencies. So please give up using these borrowed ideological terms that are irrelevant to India. The AAP leader in the discussion yesterday tried to explain this to you but you scornfully dismissed him. He was polite and deferential and you came through as arrogant. Please resist this tendency. This type of arrogance has been the downfall of Congress and could most likely be the same with BJP if it does not change its high and mighty attitude. A mighty truth has emerged with AAp's victory: whenever there is a clear alternative party, the electorate will choose it in preference to the VIP smitten netas of the ruling party at the time. It is no longer caste or even class, but a simple aam admi revolution. You will do a great service to India if as an intellectual you analyse this revolution rather than waste your time with the old Western jargon and cliches such as left of centre or right of centre - the common man is the centre now and I urge you with all humility to not shout down his representatives in future discussions. Thank you.

                            I am amazed how people got dissatisfied with BJP so easily. People please understand that governance is not about distributing free things or make sure that there is no corruption.  Because these things can considered easy parts of governance. How long it takes to pass legislation to provide subsidy(tax payer money) to give free water and electricity or wifi. <br/><br/>
But is this long term sustainable governance? Are we sure that subsidy based system  can sustain itself in longer run or can able to update/upgrade itself?<br/><br/>
One great creation of subsidy based eco-system is Railway.  We know that Indian railway has hardly made any profit and government has to subsidize passenger fair. Result is that Railway cant invest in newer technology and infrastructure with the time and we continue to complain about receiving bad service and journey while China has build bullet trains across all its major city which contribute very much in their economy. <br/><br/>
But hard thing is creating and sustaining eco-system where people can afford and pay for things they use and system can sustain and improve with the time. <br/><br/>
So people should understand that Modi is doing tough long term job. Fruits of this jobs are not seen overnight. But have faith that India and its economy is in best hands and on right path.
