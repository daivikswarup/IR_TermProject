Headline::::Sharad Yadav, Mind Your Language



DateTime::::2015-03-18T17:55:00+05:30



(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)
	Sharad Yadav should have known better. As the President of a party that rules a State and carries considerable influence, he carries a responsibility to choose his words with care. His body language and comments in Parliament on the fair or dark skin of women, and the attributes of women from the South when they dance, were outrageous and condemnable and indicated the poor and deteriorating standards of public debate often led by senior leaders.
	Later, in the face of a barrage of justifiable criticism, instead of apologising, he went a step further insulting the HRD Minister Smriti Irani when she asked him to express regret, saying, "I know what you are." These words found an echo in the Bihar Assembly when MLAs of the RJD, taking the cue from Sharad Yadav, made  nasty personal comments about the HRD Union Minister. The live telecast of such comments have an even wider impact. It is precisely because of the cascading effect on their followers and sections of the public when leaders make sexist statements that it is essential to work out a parliamentary mechanism to make members accountable for the language they use.
	There are certain issues, and certainly demeaning statements against women is one such issue, when one expects political leaders to rise above party considerations and strongly condemn such statements, regardless of who has made them. it did not happen this time. On the contrary, Parliament was further shamed in the eyes of the people, when MPs present in the House kept silent while Mr Yadav held forth, with the exception of DMK MP Kanimozhi, who got little support. Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad, a member of the Cabinet who was present in the House at that time and made no effort to intervene, made a belated statement disassociating and disapproving of the comment three days later.
	In my own experience in Parliament, I found that it was only when one made a huge fuss when any member made a sexist comment, that the Chair or others would intervene in support. It happened once that the recruitment of female cabin crew was being discussed during question hour. Snide and objectionable comments were made by some members about recruitment procedures "outside the interview office." The House found this funny and many members sniggered. Of course we protested, but found that even the Chairman at the time seemed to consider this insult to air hostesses humourous and added his own comment. Parliament was instantly turned into an all-boys'  club. The Minister who was at the receiving end of innuendos was not only unperturbed but seemed to be enjoying it. It was unpleasant to have to stand and literally shout against the Chair. Later I was told by some "not to take things too seriously."
	Women are often put on the defensive at the workplace when in their presence sexually coloured comments or " jokes" are made. The onus is on the woman to deal with the discomfort she feels.The law against sexual harassment at the work place includes a clause that places the responsibility to create an environment at the workplace free of discrimination or sexually coloured language and behaviour on the employer.
	Why should Parliament not apply the same rules for itself? Women are in a small minority in Parliament because of the lack of political will to bring the Women's Reservation Bill which would, by substantially increasing the number of women in the House, influence  behaviour and language. But as an immediate step, the Government, leaders of the opposition and the Chair of both Houses should initiate the setting up of a self-regulatory mechanism on the lines of the Ethics Committee which would make accountable members who use demeaning language against women, minorities or  oppressed castes. Parliament should also set up a Complaints Committee under the law which would also bring a measure of accountability into the behaviour of members.
	There are other aspects also to  Mr Yadav's comments. The debate was one in which Mr Yadav was on the right side. He was opposing the Bill to increase FDI in insurance to 49 per cent. He linked his opposition to an argument that equates the push to bring FDI with a trend of subjugation before white skin. The argument even at face value was unconvincing. The individual most aggressively pushing for the opening up of the Indian market to foreign capital happens at present to be the President of the United States. It is not a question of colour at all, but a commitment to a set of economic policies that push for privatisation in every sphere, regardless of the disastrous national consequences. To divert the issue to one of colour is to trivialize it.
	It is difficult to understand how a mindset can move from that argument, however weak it may be, to a discussion of the comparative beauty of white and dark skinned women. Mr Yadav now claims that this is a question of racism and that he is prepared to debate it. There is little doubt that racism exists in India. Coincidentally, NDTV was running a Whats Your Choice programme on the existence of racism and blatant discrimination against dark skin in India. But Mr Yadav's comments were hardly a rebuttal of racism. It was rank sexism.
	The politics of social justice which Sharad Yadav represents has had a powerful influence on Indian politics, overturning upper caste political and economic hegemonies. Post Mandal mobilisations in the decades of the eighties and early nineties on social justice platforms,  reflecting the repressed anger of backward communities, was met by the most objectionable casteist and also racist arguments against reservations for OBCs, dalit and tribal communities by upper caste, anti-reservation mobilisations including highly objectionable comments by young women from these castes. The passage of time has not fundamentally altered these hostilities. The big difference though is that the now upwardly mobile castes who benefitted from the post Mandal achievements mimic in substantial measure the casteist approaches to those lower down the caste hierarchies. These are reflected in the increasing atrocities against dalits by those who once fought caste oppression. It is equally reflected in patriarchal approaches towards women.
	The political platform of social justice has moved a long way from Lohia's advocacy of women' s rights. If it had not, then Sharad Yadav would have not made the remarks he did.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Yes. Well said. But Ms Karat, if you review the TV clippings you will find that there were several women members present who were themselves tittering, not even visibly upset,when all this was going on.

                            Throw him out of the parliament. But please tell me, who suggested and nominated his name for the "Best Parliamentarian" award? The person who suggested his name for the award does not even deserve a flower garland when he or she dies!

                            Mrs Karat - you are such a big hypocrite. I agree to every word you have written above. But don't you think - you are also Sharad Yadav - by standing along with him. You can write such a big article here - but not bother to push your party stall the Parliament till he apologizes. You are an equal party to all rapes that are happening - as you encourage people like Sharad Yadav.

                            With all respect to you Mrs. Karat, it is a pity that you have indulged in 5-star politics like some other Left leaders. In place of writing such articles involving the top politicians you should put your effort on the villages in West bengal to revive your party. Go to West bengal and work for your party - that is what is necessary at this stage.

                            This country is moving forward and we will not take such outdated politicians like Yadav who are essentially with the 50s mentality. Obvious male chauvinist fromt he N. Indian belt of uneducated states with little regard for women... I say within 25 years when all these oldies are dead and gone, things will move faster...

                            Dear Brinda jee,<br/>
You made a valid point,Sharad yadav was wrong in his statement.. but please tell me one thing...CPI-M is known to be against upper class..no problem..why there are no BCs and SC-STs in polit buro..? Also tell your Delhi reporters to see the villages and real India, they will find, not just upper class but BCs dominating over SC/STs.....but politicians are afraid to speak against BCs because of vote bank including CPI-M....Also when people attack GHar wapasi, why not they raise issue of maasive paid conversions occurred in South India....Delhi media will again be silent...

                            Ms Karat was silent all these days. She and the other feminists regular on TV were surprisingly out of spotlight! A word the same day from her would have carried more weight than this whole article. Should our MPs/MLAs be not given gender sensitization lessons? If they become even slightly educated on the subject, India's GDP will go up by minimum 5% and GDC (Gross Domestic Corruption) will go down by 10%.

                            Sharad Yadav is just the symptom. The problem is the general mentality of the people of his constituency towards women which he reflects without even realizing it. That needs to change. But it will take time and effort.

                            Ms. Karat....I would not like to say anything else because the political class in India is an uncouth group of individuals who are even worse than hyenas or equated to scavengers on the prowl always..My only comment would be that if only the politicians of India had brains at least half the size your kumkum, India would have moved ahead of any other country in the world in terms of decency, education/literacy, development, economy, self-reliance, agriculture, environment, manufacturing, and even communal harmony...Alas, the legislative assemblies and the parliament need more photographs of your "kumkum" to remind them that, it is only half of size of a brain of your kumkum that is needed to take India forward....anyway, thanks for the irrelevant, meaningless, unwanted, unsolicited and dramatic blog on sharad yadav's comments....I can go ahead one step to say that all politicians in India today are all "one basket full of rotten eggs" including the heads of all parties and typical hypocrites. Only a moderator can save you from see what sort of responses you get from your meaningless blog here. Will we see the end of communists in the next elections? Going by the trend, I see both the faceless-communists and the issue-less congress parties both washed out off the face of Earth! Good for all of us.

                            The entire parliament including the Speaker were guilty of laughing on this issue. They all should hang their heads in shame and apologise to the entire female population of our country. Why the great statesman Mr Modi was silent on the issue? We did not hear a word of protest from Mayawati, Mamata or Jayalalitha.

Had he gone on calling them less fortunate or incompetent owing to the skin color, one could term him sexist.

                            The Yadav clan, Sharad, Mulayam, Laalu etc belong to the medieval era and should not be present in the Parliament of 21st century. They , their mind set, their thinking and their culture is out of sync with the modern day values. They still live in the 18th century era. they cannot be made to understand the language of Ms Brinda Karat or Ms Smriti Irani. They can be silenced only by the electorate. I don't understand why they are elected by the voters?
