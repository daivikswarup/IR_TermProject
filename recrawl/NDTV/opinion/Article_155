Headline::::Mr Khurshid's Defense Lacks Conviction



DateTime::::2015-11-20T22:18:00+05:30




                                The Congress Party finds itself in a piquant position where, in a short span of about a week, three of its senior leaders are at the centre of an unsavoury controversy, each of their own making.
 
First, Mr Salman Khurshid, an eminent member of Mrs Sonia Gandhi's core team, while addressing an audience in Pakistan, alluded towards India not reciprocating Pakistan's hand of friendship and peace. With one sentence, Mr Khurshid ended up turning India's official position literally on its head, disregarding and dismissing the brazenness with which agencies of the Pakistani establishment actively use terrorism as an instrument of state policy against India.
 
Coming from a former Minister of External Affairs, this comment was even more unexpected. It also clashed with the public stance of the Congress party itself, which has consistently demanded answers and action from the Government of India on anything involving Pakistan including ceasefire violations.
 
Even as public discourse on Mr Khurshid's comment was building up, another senior Congress leader Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar came up with a shocker. In response to a question on Pakistani Television, on how relations between India and Pakistan could improve, he said - "Inko Hataye, Humko Laiye (dislodge the BJP government and help bring back the Congress party)". Not unexpectedly, public outrage was sparked. Reactions were instantaneous and acrimonious. Some considered this comment an act of treason, amounting to sedition.
 
To complete the trilogy of controversial comments, Mr Shakeel Ahmad, yet another senior Congress leader tweeted, "Thankfully Chhota Rajan & Anup Chetia (ULFA) are not Muslims. Had they been Muslims Modi govt would have a different narrative altogether" (sic). Mr Ahmad's clarification appeared worse than the original sin when he went on to state that "Had they been Muslims, the BJP would have said that Congress government or UPA government did not arrest them and did not bring them back to the country simply because they were Muslims. They would have said that the Congress and UPA were thus trying to do vote-bank politics. That is why I said that."
 
A pattern is discernible. Three controversial statements coming from a trio of Congress leaders, within a short span of time hardly qualifies as a convenient coincidence. Would it not be a fair assumption that perhaps these leaders were speaking the mind of their top leadership and projecting the current Congress stance that disregards the nation and its interests over trying to seem placatingly pleasant to another country?
 
Mr Salman Khurshid penned his defense - "In Defense of My Speech in Pakistan". In it he writes "One Ms Lekhi of the BJP put me in the league of ISIS, mouth frothing with indignation! Surely, there is a difference between someone who rapes women of other faiths, takes sex slaves, enjoys slitting throats, threatens to destroy civilisation - and someone who happens to disagree with you...The Hafiz Saeed school on venality and violence, not to mention the perversity personified in ISIS, are the common enemy of humanity and would like nothing better than humanity beginning to fight amongst itself so that they continue with their destruction..."
 
While Mr Khurshid has eloquently and correctly categorised the ISIS, why hasn't he displayed the same zeal to denounce historian Irfan Habib's comparison of the RSS with ISIS? Or does he believe the RSS is an organisation which "rapes women of other faiths, takes sex slaves, enjoys slitting throats, threatens to destroy civilisation..." much like the ISIS?
 
Mr Khurshid cannot be expected to take a risk of such magnitude. Even to be seen as remotely defending the RSS would be nothing short of anathema for members of the Congress. It is this very flexible and convenient conviction that makes his own defense, and by that measure of the ideology he presents, appear a formality.(Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre. He is also an advocate and has extensive experience in media and education.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dawn published the story "Dossiers on India have no ‘material evidence'" . NDTV will not publish an Indian point of view. I will not be surprised if Salman Khursheed and Mani be agents of ISI and pass on sensitive information to fail Modi. <br/>
I will not be bothered if Modi fails due to his own deeds or opposition's better performance  but colluding with an enemy to topple an elected leader demands nothing less than sedition charges. Freedom of speech does not mean spreading misinformation. India is in a very delicate situation where some people like Salman and Mani may act like Dawood and may help Pak clandestinely. Channels like NDTV are tacitly supporting these treason activities.

                            All 3 statements in quick succession can not be a coincidence. Seems Congress has put in place a strategy to appease Muslims via pandering to Paki sentiment. Also interesting is the stout support coming from Nawaz Sharif to Asia Andrabi in the midst of last week. One cant but help feel this is all part of an orchestrated strategy to demean &amp; discredit the government of the day Internationally.

                            If Khurshid's defence is unconvincing, so is Kohli's comments on the congressmen's motives. Kohli talks about turing India's policy on its head by talking to Pakistan, when it uses terrorism as a State Policy. Infact, the BJP has been doing precisely that. Speaking with a forked tongue, they were vociferous in condmening the UPA for cozying up to pakistan. Modi has done this on three occasions. In Ufa, Modi went further and called for dialogue. Hence, Khurshid has not said anything that is unconvincing at all. The inconsistencies are in BJP policies, which are driven by huge pressure from Nagpur. On the domestic front people were seeing the sheen come off the bJP. This is happening on the foreign front too with a disaster in Nepal. BJP is simply unbale to govern and hence the penchant for Modi to spend time in frivolous campaigns at State elections

                            Your argument on why Mr. Kurshid does not denounce the comparison of ISIS to RSS does not make any sense in this context. He used a statement by one of your MPs (who compared him to ISIS) to defend himself! You are using that to raise a non issue, of him not denouncing Irfan Habib's's opinion of the RSS! When somebody compares him to ISIS, you blame him for not putting in a nice word for RSS! This is a totally non-contextualized argument! I have no great regard for the congress politicians involved in these controversy, but the least you can do is to raise rational and logically sound arguments! Sorry for seeking too much sense in a rhetorical article! Maybe finding sense in Indian politics is a vacuous endeavour.

If not, then we will think that this is all eyewash and actually all the parties are fooling the public by having clandestine arrangements.

                            Yes, these are foolish statements and must be condemned. Period. But Nalin trying to sneak in a defense of the RSS sounds very funny! We know the long history of the RSS - their zero contribution to the freedom struggle and everything they have done since then. <br/><br/>
We should also keep in mind that these three are Congress pensioners not holding any official position. They can say anything and people will yawn. When BJP Ministers and MPs make even more disturbing statements that disturb communal harmony, why is Nalin Kholi and his boss silent???

                            Because it in not him speaking but Sonia Gandhi. <br/><br/>
Congress-I has got embolden after Bihar victory. The actual polarization was done by Congress-I and its cronies media houses. Going by the logic of 'cui bono' the main beneficiary of polarization was always going to be INC but it was never brought into political discourse for obvious reasons. <br/><br/>
Having said that, BJP should try to see the larger conspiracy which is well scripted by INC. <br/><br/>
From attacks on Christian, outrage for NGOs to award wapsi and this speaking from Pakistani platforms, there is massive inertia being moved into motion by Congress HQ to polarize and then blame it back on BJP. All entities who are subservient to Sonia Gandhi must be countered with better and aggressive strategy. They have nothing to lose and they have no other reason to be in India other than scamming it.<br/><br/>
BJP has no one to blame but it self for losing the game of perception in the hands of these Spivs.

                            The RSS and BJP have their roots in India. Nowhere else. What they say resonates with Indians. What people like Khurshid and Aiyer say resonates with Pakistanis. The Congress and its minions march to a different drum. And 68 years of poverty and corruption under Congress rule only emphasise that sad truth. If these morons think their insignificant outbursts on India from Pakistan have any relevance to Indo-Pak relations they are sadly mistaken. It only leaves a bad smell. Like them.

                            Why elections only important for intellectuals and media? There was a great debate when such statements made by one section of the society. Why everyone is so calm when Anti-national statements are made by  people like Kurshid, manishakar and Azam Khan. Is religion or caste important then the Nation and Patriotism? If such is the case people of India should ignore all intellectuals and media. If you screw the majority then he is secular and great man else communal even if they are most honest and nationalists.<br/><br/>
Really, appalling to see no reaction from many who made rackus during the Bihar election for every statement made by one party. Now there is a increase in Anti-national forces in the form of disrespectful lot viz Mani shankar, Kurshid, Azam Khan and so on. I saw a debate on IBN (Karan Tapar show "To the point") where there were two Indians and two Pakistanis in the panel. Infact I did see three Pakistani's that includes disgraceful Mani Shankar who was critical about India than Pakistanis. My heart bled when I heard stupid views of such Anti-national element called Mani Shankar. He is a shame for the great nation like India. The beggar asks rogue country like Pakistan to remove PM of the nation? He does have b....s so asks the slaughter Pakistan to increase terrorism in India so that they can shout on the streets to remove the democratically elected govt. Who will support.. please come forward...<br/><br/>
Howcome news channels give such prominence to such filthy characters. How come Pseudo scientist like PM Bhargav, Author Nayanathara are quite now? They wanted anti-national and corrupt parties win the election? Where is the nationalism in people who were former ministers and now lawmakers. Can't you slap sedition on such cook elements?<br/><br/>
I like all should be equal, then why Sharia.. where is the equality. Let everyone one equal and get equal rights. Media and people of India should realise else this country will go nowhere.

                            Well the lack of conviction in Lekhi, swamy and now the leader of idiots Kohli shows the direction they are moving to ( darkness) and then commenting that they are being wrongly projected.... Wake up Kohli...any sensible person now can disclose your party's real face and agenda... Without saying...sensibility is something the Sanghis have derided long back. Mr Khurshid again talked sense

                            I see lot of Anti BJP/RSS comments here. They are fine with Mani's rant but feel BJP is against India. Now I feel most commentators are paid by some vested interests

                            In attacking Salman Khurshid, Kohli joins up all statements from entire congress clan. Now, if Congress does the same, by joining entire RSS clan, including VHP, RamSena, then that wont be Modi's position.

                            This is a ridiculous piece. Dismissing dialogue with Pakistan may be your party's method of bringing peace to the subcontinent. But have the decency to allow for other more creative approaches. Stop calling people names just because disagree with their methods.

                            The only difference is Khurseed , Aiyar and Hafiz did these acts from Pakistan while other monkey did it from India.

                            So far, no disagreement with, let alone condemnation of, the stupid comments of this trio has come forth either from Sonia or Rahul, even though what they have blabbered is very probably seditious, certainly unpatriotic and deliberately calculated to raise the communal temperature in the country. No national party, certainly not one pretending to carry the torch of the national spirit that the freedom struggle lit long ago, could even associate at a distance with such tripe. This only proves that they had the safe blessings of the so called "HIGH" command in doing so. For this High Command, ANYTHING that is derogatory to Modi and the BJP is Gospel, no questions asked, howsoever false and inflammatory that may be.

Someone calls you a bad name. Your defense will "appear a formality" if you do not also defend all others who are ever called the same bad name.

                            Mr. Khurshid had accepted that while in the ministry he cant produce innovative ideas due to ministry protocols.......so why he accepted that ministry first of all if he himself was not sure. In pakistan he had praised the Pak army,pak govt, you had declared that Pakistan is the most suffered from the militancy and india should talk to Pakistan.It was pathetic that spineless person like he was the our foreign minister..............Mr. khurshid..........himself had accepted that he were making the foreign policy keeping in mind Arnav Goswami talk show............

                            We are in this mess because of the 60 years of congress rule. lets make sure they dont make a come back for another 20 years. BJP is doing good work and it ok as long as there are no visible communal politics being played like the notorious rath yatra. If they do that, they are also out and we should look at NOTA and have president rule in the country. May be some day BJP and congress will come together to fight a bigger enemy like laloo and nitish. LOL

                            Interesting that all that Mr Khurshid says about ISIS is done by them in the name of Islam, often atrocities committed by its foot soldiers after saying their prayers!

                            Can someone in their right mind please explain why some of our moronic political leaders love to humiliate our own country to appease other nations ? Congressmen did this when they went begging to US government petitioning them to not provide visa to Modi and now are going to Pakistan making such irresponsible statements? Is congress party greater than our national interest and self respect ? How low can you and will you guys stoop to slam a democratically elected government of India ?

                            Mr. Kohli, It is your article that lacks conviction. Mr. Khurshid speech has nothing to do with ISIS. It was your Ms. Leki who was comparing him to ISIS. If that is the case why does he have to take a stand for or against RSS. As always all of BJP is blindly defending the "Old men in shorts". You have every right to defend your ideology and so does everybody else. India is still a democracy!!!!
