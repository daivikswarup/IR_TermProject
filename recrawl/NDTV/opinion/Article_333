Headline::::Where Were 'PK' Protestors as it Racked up 100 Crores?



DateTime::::2014-12-29T22:47:00+05:30




                                (Dilip Cherian watches movies infrequently but battles for free speech often.)There must be a special streak of either insanity or pugnacity in the "fringe elements" who are trying to create trouble for PK. Let's to start with assume that they are not all set up by Amir Khan to raise his already stratospheric billings. Anyone who has seen the movie (and that clearly excludes those gentlemen in the fringes referred to earlier) knows that Amir Khan hasn't focused on any one religion. He's finessed a spoof of everything religious that can be skewered in the length of time that a movie allows.Now leave aside the obvious issues of artistic freedom or giving space for free expression to all ideas. 3 question marks hover in the air as the Fringees steam about ripping posters and venting heat.Question One: Where they asleep for 10 days while PK racked up Rs. 100 crores in sales? Now its just a matter of raising decibel, isn't it?Question Two: Are they part of a plot to occupy media and Mainstream Maddies (as opposed to Fringees!) while Mr Modi gets Ordinances passed, Bills through and Governments formed?Question Three: Don't they get the message that Oh My God and PK are all now part of mainstream thinking? Young people now want freedom and choices. Not fetters and silenced voices. Or are these Fringee young people different?Beyond these questions, the more sinister thought is the reason why there is a rash of those on the Fringe now. Is it that they simply can't be controlled now or is it because they have all simultaneously decided that this is their opportune moment in the sun?The rest of the world watches with the joy as we descend to the level of monsters in our neighborhood Pakistan and Bangladesh or further away in Sudan or North Korea. Meanwhile the Royals of the Right, like Advani, are steamrolled over in efforts by the Fringees to take centre stage. Where these unguided set of missiles will land next with a thud, is anybody's guess. Can you?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            We dont expect much intellect from a communist state person. BUt OMG and PK are completely different stream movies. No one raised object on OMG but PK is plain and stupidly communal in nature. And you are utterly idiot to bring in Modi in this.<br/>
There are lot of things that go wrong at masjids and majars along baba ashrams in hinduism ... but no one talks about them why? because it will be called communal .... 95-99% of all religions babas or masihas are fraud/rapist or molestors we know that .. but really do we need to call "jo darr gaya woh mandir gaya" spare that atleast ...

                            I absolutely accept that the movie is good and did touch every religion. But the intensity of touching other religion other than Hinduism seems to be occupying 98% of the movie. While he has the guts to distribute pamphlets In The movie saying Hindu gods missing, y weren't there pics of Jesus or Allah missing??? Is that because the main stream elements of other religions will react??? He didn't have guts to make a strong point on the terror bomb blast part in d movie. It was jus showed with a dialog "some1 wanted to prove their God???" Who r those and y weren't those idiotic beliefs of that religion not shown????  But ............. I do accept it was a great movie with a good msg and also taken for markets in Pakistan, Middle East and other Muslim countries which has Bollywood market.

                            Freedom of expression in India is simply freedom to Insult Hindus alone. Why dont you try this stuff on Muslims and watch the fun ? In an upcoming kannada film 'Shivam' around 4 minutes have been censored out because it has reference to Muslim destruction of Hindu temples - that fact will not be highlighted by our Vatican and Mecca loving Secular Media.

                            All these intellectuals who battle for free speech, wake up only when someone from the majority community raise their voice / concerns. Where was this so called 'free speech protector' when people from another community started havoc for some cartoon published in another country? Where was he when the ones from the same community started attacking Churces in our country when someone in US has threatened to burn the holy book of their faith? Where was he when someone has insulted our mother land and hurt the sentiments of the majority community thru his stupid paintings? Has he openes his mouth then?

                            First of all Movies to be regarded as movies for entertainment only. It should not be taken for role model or advise or education or searching facts...faith is one thing which cannot be explained by any one, it is between an human being and his Creator.<br/><br/>
However no one has right in this world to claim that he/she is agent of Creator and can be a middle man/women between Creator and humans.. if doing so is pure for materialistic purpose, nothing else..if this PK film is exposing this, there is no harm...<br/><br/>
Also these bajrang dals and vhp are becoming more like terrorist organization, taking law into their own hands and inflicting wounds, bringing hatred, communalize each and every incident and bring devastation to general public and government properties, which need to be tamed, else this will become Al-Qadea for India.

                            It is a well known fact that "under world" issues threats to extract some pie from the film makers. It appears that Sangh Parivaar also wants that since some Chakrapani wants 200 crores collected by PK film makers to be given to them. Since the modus operandi of Sangh Parivaar outfits &amp;  under world is similar, so both the outfits are same except that one is under world and the other is over world.

                            This movie is only about highly simplistic 'criticisms' of religion in the most superficial way possible. Religious leaders being insincere - What a revelation! It always impresses those who recently broke away from religion or emotional folks who chant 'religion is the cause of war' and other mindless cliches like 'money is the root of all evil'. However, the people behind this cannot begin to think of spirituality in an intelligent, mature way. They never read or experience anything that is genuinely spiritual. This movie is aimed at those who have education and middle class status, but cannot think for themselves. Only an emotional fool (like the ones who declared that 'India' itself must be ashamed over the actions of a few rapists) would applaud this movie.<br/><br/>
Also, Bollywood movies do not compare favourably with other Indian cinema. They specialize in borrowing ideas, sometimes from south Indian cinema, and often from Hollywood. How many times have we seen this idea before? Foreigner, superhero, alien comes to study the local ways, assisted by a female journalist?

                            I refused to read the article as soon as I saw the title "Where Were 'PK' Protestors as it Racked up 100 Crores?". The writer, it seems, has this weird logic that if a movie earns 100 crores, it translates into support from all corners. In fact, for an informed opposition, you have to watch it, as I did. Leaving few comical bits here and there, it was a one sided battering of caricatured characters, which makers projected as to represent whole community of believers. Fail!

                            Dear Sir,<br/><br/>
Movies are making 100 crores which are not deserve to make even 10 Rs, but they are running, people went to watch movie in the name of Raj Kumar Hirani and Amir Khan. So in that sense their ownership towards any communal or stupidity that they showed in the movie becomes very larger. They are followed by number of people and if such people dont think twice before putting some scene and dialog in the movie then they should be ashamed and has to be convicted for hurting person sentiments.

                            I do not understand why there are anti PK and support PK groups fighting in forums. This will only give more n more popularity to the movie and of-course more n more money to the producers. Understand that its a fact that a Hindu dominated, but secular country cannot and should not insult the religious beliefs of other faiths. Having said that the author himself have mentioned about the anti Islam movie in Pakistan and there are hundreds of anti Christian movies all over the world, especially coming out from christian dominated countries. Somewhere I read that Hindu is a soft target. Its funny when they say that a country with 80% Hindus do feel that they are threatened by the rest of 20%. I have not watched the movie yet, but I am sure it will only be exposing frauds in the name of religion. Otherwise, the supreme court or the censor board would have already banned it. <br/><br/>
Be aware of religions fanatics from all religions scribbling in these forums and do not fight in the name of a film for (any god) sake.

He has showed that christians have saved Tamil Nadu from Tsunami and hindus even not realising that. We need u to raise ur voice on this. Also on PK, the film was certified by censor By Leela Samson who was caught in christensing Bharatnatyam in Tamil Nadu. But congress helped her a seat on censor board. Please raise ur voice on this

                            Definitely a good movie Dileep but Aamir and the producers did not do the balancing act with finesse as you seem to claim. Everything excellent about the so called umpteen godmen in all religions, more prominent in Hindus (includes Sikhism and some others broadly coming under the Hinduism umbrella) and Christians (I cannot say for Islam, though it is equally ridden with other controversies - the less said the better). Everything about Hinduism must be tolerated if not, it is "insecular" and anything abous Islam is forbidden? In India "freedome of speech" is there but one needs to exercise it with restrint especially when it comes to religious sentiments. Ammir and Co have definitely lacked inprojecting in proportionately - let us leave aside the revenue, we have seen, even shit generates money in India.

                            Loved PK,it's a fantastic film, Aamir are brilliant as usual, I laughed till I cried,very moving &amp; entertaining! Thank you &amp; Mr. Hirani for making such an wonderful movie! I think there is no reason for anyone to be upset by the film,for the film was speaking in general about all religion &amp; religious prejudice! It is indeed one of Aamir's most prominent work and perhaps his best film yet, I have a muslim wrong number in my vicinity! Who takes money from the ignorants, I wish I could stop it or make the ignorants aware of their own foolishness!So we have such characters from all religion who needs to be held accountable for their actions!

                            People with shallow knowledge on hinduism should not comment on practice of idol-worship.Please read Swami Vivekananda's biography to understand the essence of it.<br/>
The king of Jaipur asked the same question to Swamiji. <br/>
Then he asked one of raja's mantris to spit on king's portrait; but he refused to do that. Swamiji said, come on , do it.. that's just a portrait. <br/>
Then the king realised the idea of idol worshiping. We don't worship a portrait or a stone idol , but the person or god who is represented thru it.

                            Pls mind your own religion Mr Cherian; where were ur thoughts when so called secular govt banned "Da vinci code" . Others can have feeling , sentiments, but no hindus, isn't it . Because it originated in a poor third world country.

                            Well...Well, no comments further i would be silent like the current leader BJP's silence, as we knows the allies of the BJP well - RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, very well spoken leaders;-) we all know  are on all the media and papers now in the name of religion and poor BJP  in same boats as existing earlier silent Congress then :-) Maun Vrat for Mr. Modi.  Am waiting for BJP leaders who used to be loud in opposition  to comment is it right or wrong. As to the movie goes isn't what is being tried to be conveyed happening in reality!!!. And secondly its not focussed on any one religion

                            @soldier: What do you mean you don't expect much intellect from a 'communist state person'. It shows where you are coming from. And from your language, it appears that you are a junglee from north India. We also do not expect much intellect or wisdom from north Indian wild life.

                            The basic assumption itself is wrong; it s a smart ',marketing strategy' for a movie that is not doing well..

                            I haven't seen the movie,but I think most of us are missing the feelings of general public to which ever faith he/she maybe.We are at 125 million.What percentage of this figure constitutes the groups in question,intellectuals ..etc,in my opinion a miniscule %. Has anybody bothered to look at Faith from the common man whose daily living is a struggle.Can't make ends meet,struggles for everything in life,runs from pillar to post,doesn't understand what is a fiscal policy or has no time for the same,listens to many promises made knowing fully well that nothing is going to change and he has to to do a job how so ever menial it is to survive and feed his family. He struggles all day and comes back to his/her so called home and when sleeping will say to himself " KAL KA DIN UPPAR WALA DHEK LEGA". That is the simplest of the prayer which gives him solace till the next day and the after and so on.I think he/she should not be robbed of this by degrading any faith.

                            It is the time people have to wake up. PK is a movie not a rule in Parliament. From PK or OMG you will get a message. whether we have to accept it or deny it, it is our own decision.<br/>
Then why people showing such arrogant i don't understand. In GITA any where it has told that give gold or give money , then GOD will satisfy. If GOD satisfy by money then every billionaire would be a great devotee.  <br/>
Stop doing politics by name of GOD. The only way is believe in GOD and be free fear from GOD. Only love to GOD from bottom of your heart.

                            Guys, Debate <br/><br/>
Don't debate about the movie.. debate about message in movie<br/><br/>
Consider the following verse from the Gita:<br/><br/>
 "Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures."<br/>
 [Bhagavad Gita 7:20]<br/><br/>
 The Gita states that people who are materialistic worship demigods i.e. ‘gods' besides the True God.<br/><br/>
...same thing goes to islam.. darga is money making palce.. no were islam support darga.. read first then comment

                            PK is showing the truth and bitterness of religious misuse of God in India specially in Hindus.<br/>
Protest is mostly triggered by godmans decibels because:<br/>
1. They are weak brain and brainwashed by godmans.<br/>
2. Getting directions from godmans to stop this kind of movies so that they can run their business without any interruption and distraction.
