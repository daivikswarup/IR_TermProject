Headline::::Kejriwal's Humility Admirable, RSS Leaders Noted



DateTime::::2015-02-16T18:08:00+05:30




                                
	(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	Addressing a gathering of 11,000 karsevaks at the railway grounds in Kanpur, Mohan Bhagwat in the last two days has made two important statements which reflect on his agenda for the BJP. In the first statement, Bhagwat, the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS, sought to appropriate the father of the Indian constitution when he said "Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution, believed in the ideology of the Sangh and had called its workers symbols of social unity and integrity". He added, "We need to take steps to minimize the gap among social communities. Ambedkar, who worked in this direction, believed in the ideology of Hinduism."
	The statement is significant ahead of the Bihar elections and the current rebellion in the state by Jitan Ram Manjhi, who hails from the backward classes. It is a different matter that the Sangh has always taken pride in its upper caste lineage, and that Ambedkar detested the RSS and its ideologues including Veer Savarkar.
	In another statement made at the venue, Bhagwat struck a reconciliatory note with the socialist and secular frame of the country by invoking Ram Manohar Lohia, stating that all Indians were children of patriots.
	Around the same time as Bhagwat made these statements suggesting a more inclusive approach, Satish Upadhyay, the head of the BJP in Delhi, where the party was routed last week, made what seemed like an indirect attack on PM Modi when he told a newspaper "Arrogance is a liability. Delhi has its own culture, we need to be careful with words."
	The comment, if party insiders are to be believed, was hinted at Amit Shah's 'political jumla' statement on the black money issue. Upadhyay used the occasion to further suggest that poor decision-making at the very top for the Delhi elections cost the BJP the capital.
	Upadhyay gave sentiment to an increasing resentment against the Modi-Shah style of politics not just by leaders in the BJP but by a huge section of the RSS leadership which allegedly includes Bhagwat and other disgruntled leaders who are opposed to what is being perceived autocratic style of functioning.
	Sample this: a month ago, a senior RSS leader called upon a left-wing intellectual and asked him his opinion on the current government. The intellectual, who was surprised at the sudden call by the Sangh leader, sought to please him by suggesting that corruption was nowhere to be seen. He was however shocked when the leader suggested that corruption was now taking place behind closed doors and hence could not be seen.
	In an unofficial chintan baithak held a day after the Delhi results, RSS ideologues expressed their anger at PM Modi's pompous display of power and money - the 10-lakh suit allegedly being among the irritants - which it believed went against the very idea of the Sangh whose karyakartas are asked to lead a modest life. A leader who was part of the meeting refused to comment on record, but said that the session urged Modi to take learnings in humility and social politics from Arvind Kejriwal whose apology to the Delhi public for his resignation last year endeared him to the masses which gave him a thumping majority.
	"He must not forget that he will always have to be a swayamsevak and the pradhan sevak that he claims to be cannot contradicted himself with his display of designer brands," said the attendee, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	It's a known fact that the RSS leadership has been divided on Narendra Modi with many like Suresh Soni, Sanjay Joshi seeking to neutralize the Modi-Shah combo in recent times. Another disgruntled Sangh leader told this journalist "Not everyone in the Sangh is like some spokespersons who claim to be karyakartas but drink expensive champagnes and are a part of high-profile parties."
	A similar sentiment was echoed by the RSS rebels in 2012 when it became clear that Modi was to lead the Bhartiya Janta Party, but Bhagwat quelled the opposition as he was confident that Modi was the trump card that would deliver victory to the BJP.
	Now with a possible change in guard in the RSS - General Secretary Dattatray Hosabale is among the frontrunners to take over the Sangh in 2015 when Bhagwat's term ends, there is an increasing chant that an insider from the parivaar should be appointed to be a part of the decision-making process for the BJP's political matters along with PM Modi and Amit Shah who have also been at the receiving end for allegedly being vindictive towards veteran BJP leaders as well as those who were opposed the duo in the past.
	According to Sangh insiders, the chintan meeting which took place post the Delhi debacle in Nagpur, it ensured that besides Ram Madhav, who is considered close to the Modi-Shah duo, another team of leaders will be deputed by Hosabale and Bhagwat to look into the affairs of Kashmir and Bihar.
	With his relations with America and China striking a controversial note (Obama's comments on religious tolerance is a contributor as is China's concerted efforts to cosy up to Pakistan), questions are also being asked of the Modi-Shah duo and their foreign affairs team.
	The guiding hand of the RSS seems poised to get a (tighter) grip. Perhaps it's not just the honeymoon with voters that has ended for Modi and Shah.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why to draw parallel between Delhi CM and RSS. In case it has to - it should be with India PM. In India I have seen people from a community cheering for Pak in y'day match. What an integrity with the nation where they live. If one can not take pride in being Indian they should better leave India.

                            If only Humility could give everybody free water, if humility could halve the price of power, if humility could drive a change in the society where all are respected, if humility could get rid of corruption, I bet most of us will strive for that humility. I would rather that we have a CM who is arrogant and who drives change through than have a humble person making near impossible promises. But unfortunately all analysts have ignored the economics of the promises and just focused on personality, humility etc. But this is the Media age, after all! Substance is in a very distant second place.

                            You people just wanted to denigrate RSS and Modi.  First of all study well and then write. First of all, RSS members are called as Swayam sevak not, Karsevak.<br/>
Modi's capacity is incalculable and his personal grit and determination is unmatchable. This is well known to all, even for his critics. You people were seems to be barking quite some time now; but sadly enough, his image is growing-up day-by-day; and inversely proportional to you people's hatred speeches.   Please note that whatever way, you people trying to  belittle him, disparage him or denigrate him,  his image is steadily growing, with a ratio of 1:1000, that means;  in each &amp; every hatred speech, his image is growing-up thousand times, and his image resonate beyond India's borders.

                            How is that whenever there is a story on BJP/RSS, the reporter's sources are always 'party insiders', 'from credible source', 'unofficial', 'behind closed doors', 'party worker who refused to comment on record' and something like this, on which reporters are not bothered to name them or prove their credibility.

                            I think politicians of our nation should realize the rising expectation of citizen for transparent and assessable governance, delivering on promises and above all staying away from polarization. Divide and rule is not the order of the day rather stay united and progress together should be the mantra... Sajid Khalid

                            Ms Rana Ayyub has clearly proved she does not know anything about the RSS. I invite her to get to know them, read a little more, visit a Shakha and learn it for herself than base her write up on earlier thesis compiled by blind leftist and Nehruvian intellectuals of JNU or her own imaginations sitting on a couch. Sad...this is wha journalism has turned into...!!!! Check things out for yourselves journos, experience it!!!!

I for one don't think Modi or Shah can recover from here.They have gone down too much in the wrong lane.  Modi is no way connected to frugal living and high thinking. He has been gulped dowm the throat by perks of power and ther is no sign or even a desire to come out of that.<br/>
I think Modi looks lost forever from a RSS pracharak.

                            One thing that RSS isn't is a casteist organization, they could be termed as anti muslims, xenophobic, and many other things. But one thing they can not termed as taking pride in high caste origin. That is utter rubbish. They don't do that, they wont tolerate it.<br/><br/>
And yes very true, Dr Ambedkar's view is well known. Co-opting Ambedkar by RSS is a small chance event. You should then listen to how Dr Ambedkar felt about Mahatma Gandhi. The contempt and derision is only things that he had for Mahatma. Getting Mahatma Gandhi credentialed by Dr Ambedkar is a no chance event.

                            Sad to see a lot of people indirectly commenting on the religion of the Author based on her name. Gladly, these exactly are the ~30% BJP/RSS supporters that carry the mindset which became clear from the Delhi elections. I am confident, that India cannot get divided along communal lines with the remaining 70% opting for peace, harmony and inclusiveness.

                            I also know a handful of my classmates who would cheer when Indian captain Azharuddin or Arshad Ayyub would lose their wickets back in the day. The behavior is not a monopoly of one single community. I also had a Jain friend who preferred Pakistan cricket team over India - never once was his patriotism questioned by anyone. Have the spine to call it out the way it is - which is both ways.

                            India's religious fanatics are one of the different faces of same coin.Faith and religion may be not be the same but certainly brutal ideology was to mention....No religion is spared over here.<br/><br/>
Visitors to this page can see how both religious fanatics (they may think they are not) are arguing about peace and tranquility by throwing venomous thoughts to each other to justify their bloody ideology and crimes.<br/><br/>
If you attack church in India or Buddhist statue in Afghanistan, and justify your crime by pointing finger to each other, that wont hide your crime.
