Headline::::Cecil The Lion Has Exposed More Than Just An Idiot Dentist



DateTime::::2015-07-30T18:47:00+05:30




                                Cecil the Lion. A prime example, from Zimbabwe, of the best of the species. That wonderful black mane, quite rare now in lions, that powerful demeanor and wild presence, now reduced unforgivably to a rug, in some idiot dentist's house. Lured out of his protected space into a hunting concession with bait, and then shot with a bow and arrow. A lousy shot, apparently, as it did not kill him, instead allowing him to suffer for over 40 hours before he was tracked and shot. One wonders if Walter Palmer, the wealthy US dentist, is any more accurate with a drill than a bow and arrow. 
 
The killing of Cecil, while tragic, is just a slice of the tragedy pie that is the state of lions in Africa today. Estimated numbers suggest that today Africa has less than 30,000 lions. A population estimate in 2012 put numbers at 32,000. This might sound like a huge number, but remember these estimates are for a continent and not a country. 
 
Just 50 years ago, there were about 100,000 lions. So there has been a 70% drop in population. Habitat loss is the main reason for the decline. Just 10,000 years ago, lions were the most widespread mammals after humans. Then agriculture started, and they steadily started to lose their home ranges. 
 
But trophy-hunting has played its own insidious role. When idiots with big egos like Walter Palmer the dentist want to kill a lion, they want to kill a big male lion with a dramatic mane. Usually male lions like that are the prime of their species, and their genes are crucial for keeping lion populations healthy and strong. When the males are killed, prides get thrown in disarray as other males try to take over and kill cubs. Female lions who fight to protect cubs get injured and killed. Several conservationists support hunting as they say that without hunting, more wild spaces would be converted to farms as the money made through hunting incentivises the owners of concessions to keep the habitat wild. 
 
But we have to ask what is stopping African countries and the IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, from declaring the lion as an endangered species. Not only are lion numbers in steady decline, but many populations suffer from bovine TB and feline HIV, making them vulnerable and weak to disease. They are also in conflict with people over cattle deaths.
 
Right now, the lion is declared as a vulnerable species, and African countries still make their own laws on hunting. The Lion is also only on appendix 2 of CITES, the Convention On International Trade In Endangered Species. This means licenses to hunt can be obtained legally, and a certain amount of trade in lion body parts is allowed. For example, Cecil's head and skin was allowed to be taken out of Zimbabwe and into the US. If lions were shifted into appendix 1 of the CITES laws, all hunting and trade would have to be stopped. 
 
With hundreds of millions of dollars coming into African nations through hunting, and much of the bed rock of modern conservation in Africa being built on a theory of sustainable hunting, it's an uphill battle to get African countries on board to stop all hunting. Hunting has reduced a great deal in the last two decades with greater public protests and tourism also becoming major money spinners, but with species numbers also dropping, it is still a significant concern.
 
There are community-owned hunting concessions in Africa that have worked well. As communities make money off the hunting of the animals, they help protect the habitat for the animal and stop all illegal hunting. The laws of the legal hunts are strict, with only older non-breeding animals being declared fair game. 
 
In response to the reduction of legal hunts has emerged the reviling practice of canned hunting, where lions and other big cats are bred in captivity, hand-raised by humans, and then once grown to the size of a trophy, offered up to hunters. These animals don't run, could be drugged, are fenced in with nowhere to go, and are basically sitting ducks. South Africa can proudly claim to be the capital of canned hunting. Owners of canned hunting farms will say they are doing a service, as they are anti the trophy hunting of animals in the wild, and because they are providing a service that aids conservation as their animals are captive bred. If Cecil was a shocker, imagine a lioness, a mother, shot by a hunter against a fence, from where she did not run because her cubs were on the other side. Imagine her dead with blood and milk flowing out of her body while her cubs look on. No, I am not making this up. This is a video I have seen and used in my documentaries on canned hunting . 
 
The word "game" in reference to animals that are hunted, some say, is derived from the Greek word "Gamos", which symbolizes a marriage, a union between gods. Here, it symbolizes a union between the hunter and the hunted. When we humans lived as hunter-gatherers, hunting, while a survival tool, was a spiritual expression with the deep understanding of the entwined connections between all living things in the web of life. Even in that time, we knew better than to kill apex predators like lions unless it was in self-defense. In fact, in Southern Africa, there are accounts of cooperative hunting between the San, the bushmen, and Lions. 
 
It is such a great pity today that it is about the divide between man and animals. A practice driven by egos in the notion that we are greater, when in actuality we are just the human animal blundering our own way through the living world. Losing that basic connection to nature shows today, as we are deep in the middle of the sixth mass extinction (we have had five mass extinctions already in the world over the many millions of year with the dinosaurs being the last one), climate change, and a countdown to our own extinction.  (Swati Thiyagarajan is an Environment Editor with NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What Walter Palmer did is not acceptable but why to criticize the profession? Being a dentist is already hard to survive on top of that your headlines make it living hell cause people who just read headlines have no clue whats inside story. Stop being judgmental on profession cause everyone is not the same.

                            Mr.Walter Palmer needs to get the same fate like the recent terrorist who was put to death. Shameful Palmer needs to be caught and given to the lions for they(lions) would know the best punishment for those who kill their member of the pride

                            You write so beautifully. I wish there were more people like you less like the idiot dentist. You said it right, humans are breeding like cockroaches and surely we will cause the 6th mass extinction. Sad but true.

                            Your columns are always a delightful read. A couple of quibbles, however, on this one:<br/>
1. Palmer took the head, so Cecil won't end up as a rug, but on a wall.<br/>
2. No love lost for Palmer, but bringing in his drilling skills was uncalled for.<br/>
3. A crossbow was used, not a bow and arrow; they are as different as tigers and lions.<br/>
Thanks.

                            The whole world is angry at the dentist for killing a celebrity lion. The issue isn't him. Hunting licenses are the issue. Is hunting a regular normal non-VIL (Very Important Lion) any less horrific than maiming Cecil?

Uh...no. It's a German/English-derived word meaning "fun, amusement." Has nothing to do with the ancient Greek word for weddings, from which we get (e.g.) monogamy, polygamy, gamete.

                            It is sickening that he paid $50000 to get the permits to hunt. Money is sure an evil thing.

                            Talk about Indian wildlife and its preservation. That is in serious trouble. The death of one African lion does not make it an endangered species.

                            Dentist is Doctor and I would say he is Killer. Now is tern of him to be killed. Do not spare this dentist and hang him in African safari right there where  Lion killed. All doctors having extra -loot of money do this kind of activity. In world, remove entire doctor community and be your own doctor. Let these doctors be begger and be killed by themselves. Americans you shame o shame idiots!! Zimbabwe you shame too because of money- you are corrupt as anyone in the world!!
