Headline::::Communal Campaign in Bihar? Not the BJP's



DateTime::::2015-11-04T14:59:00+05:30




                                Whenever an election campaign draws to an end, especially if the outcome is too close to call, opponents of the BJP invariably fall back on their patented war cry, "Secularism in danger!"
Very often there is no basis to substantiate this claim, but this now happens routinely. And Bihar is no exception. So it is not surprising that in the last fortnight, Mahagathbandhan leaders are crying hoarse that the BJP has communalised the campaign. Equally predictably, sections of the media have echoed this contention at mounting decibel levels.
 
Pray, what is the evidence of the alleged communalisation of the campaign by the BJP? Only two instances are cited. First, BJP president Amit Shah's claim that celebratory firecrackers would go off in Pakistan if BJP lost the election. And second, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's assertion that the 'Grand Alliance' is conspiring to reduce the quantum of reservations for OBCs and SC/STs and transfer this to minorities. Also, the current national obsession with beef has not escaped attention, but in this case it is Lalu Yadav who brought the issue to the forefront with his bland assertion, "Hindus too eat beef".
 
In every election, Pakistan is often targeted by politicians to underline their own nationalistic credentials while questioning those of their opponents. Such remarks draw loud applause at public meetings because a bit of Pakistan-bashing always goes down well with crowds. It is not the BJP alone which indulges in this; other parties too make similar jingoistic and rhetorical remarks. Obviously, these are meant to be a humorous aside rather than a grave diplomatic policy statement. It can at best be described as unnecessary overstatement, but how can it be inferred as communal?
 
Arguably crackers are unlikely to be burst in Pakistan were the BJP to lose a state election in India. But assuming for a moment that this indeed happens, what would that indicate? It would suggest that some people in Pakistan would rejoice at the BJP's defeat if that happens. But does it suggest anything about Bihar? If you stretch this argument and say that Pakistani Muslims (anyway, people of other faiths are hardly found in Pakistan any more) dislike Narendra Modi, does it have any implications for Bihar? Had Amit Shah suggested that Indian Muslims too would be happy to see the BJP lose, he could have been accused of seeking to polarise voters on communal lines. But he made no such inference. It is the communalised mindset of the BJP's opponents that is exposed by their reaction to the BJP chief's remark.
 
What Amit Shah said would be clear even to a 10-year-old child: Pakistanis may not like Narendra Modi as he is known to be a tough leader who will not bend backwards to please the Islamabad establishment in an elusive pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize unlike his predecessor. So, many people in Pakistan would be happy if the Indian Prime Minister and his party suffer a setback in the Bihar election. What does it have to do with communalism?
 
For years, the Congress played the communal card overtly wooing Muslims while doing nothing for their economic or educational uplift. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh went to the extent of publicly declaring that the first right on India's national resources belonged not just to minorities as a whole but Muslims in particular. Few would forget the claim by Congress spokespersons that Sonia Gandhi shed copious tears when a young Indian Muslim doctor was wrongly identified as a co-conspirator in the Brisbane airport bombing and labelled a terrorist by Australian authorities before the truth was revealed and he was set free. These symbolic utterances of a communal nature were clearly intended to consolidate the Congress party's vote bank which had been shaken in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition.
 
Generally speaking, rightly or wrongly, many Muslims do not vote for the BJP, but whenever die-hard pro-Muslim regional parties like the Samajwadi Party in UP or Trinamool Congress in West Bengal seem to be a good option, Muslims prefer not to vote for the Congress. Public memory may be short, but in Bihar it is not short enough to forget the systematic massacre of over 1,100 Muslims in Bhagalpur in 1989 under a Congress government. Bihari Muslims, like their Hindu brethren, are a highly politicised community and well informed of current events. They also remember the Congress's track record when it comes to fostering communal elements and even riots in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and several other states through the 1970 and 80s. Therefore, the party has no option but to demonise the BJP as communal to make Muslims insecure. And so, the so-called secularists are compelled to blow out of proportion the tragic killing of a Muslim in Dadri over beef rumours, hoping that would absolve them of the sins of Muzaffarpur and umpteen communal riots under a "secularist" Government.
 
The Mahagathbandhan also found a handy card in RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement seeking review of the entire policy of reservations followed hitherto. He had sought a review to ensure that only the most backward classes, and not those already empowered, derive quota benefits. But this aspect of his statement and subsequent clarifications got lost in the din created by the Mandalite parties. The Prime Minister repeatedly asserted that quotas derive legitimacy from laws enacted by Parliament and no power can snatch them away. But it served the Mandalites to obscure this. Gathbandhan leaders went a step further to promise quotas to minority communities too, but couched it in "secular" terminology saying that Dalit Muslims and Christians should also benefit from reservations. But where would these quotas come from? Obviously, these would have to be hived off the existing Dalit and OBC quotas. When the BJP pointed this out, the Gathbandhan leaders panicked, ran to the Election Commission against the BJP's newspaper advertisements and had them banned. Meanwhile, they raised an outcry saying the BJP was trying to communalise the poll campaign.
 
This is really strange. Those who say backward Muslims and Christians should also get a share of quotas are not communal, but those who point out that reservation on religious lines are not constitutionally permissible are. So, who is communalising the Bihar campaign, the BJP or the so-called secularist parties?
 
Luckily for Bihar, the beef issue did not acquire the same dimensions that it did in TV studios in the country, although Lalu Yadav did his best to kickstart a controversy with his claim that Hindus too eat beef. Well, there is no exact count but it is known that some jet-setting, five-star-types indeed consume cow's meat, if not within India but often abroad. But Lalu ended up scoring a self-goal with this remark as rural Yadavs, being engaged mainly in agricultural and pastoral activities, revere the cow and would recoil at the thought of consuming even buffalo meat, leave alone cow. It seems the RJD chief had hoped for a frenzied BJP reaction to his remark which would have communalised the atmosphere and helped him consolidate the M component of his MY (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank. But the BJP played it down, allowing the widespread disbelief among Hindus to play out and isolate Lalu Yadav, rather than raise the pitch and be charged with communalising the campaign.
 
On balance, therefore, it must be said that far from falling into the communal trap laid for it by its opponents, the BJP acted maturely throughout the campaign. But for the so-called secularists, the BJP is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't. So, it is burdened with the cross of allegedly fomenting communalism regardless of its actions.(Dr. Chandan Mitra is a journalist, currently Editor of The Pioneer Group of Publications.

                            We should be strengthening the PM's hands for the development of the country. PM Modi led NDA has taken many steps for the country's development and opposition parties including congress and the janta parivaar have no development agenda and hence want the focus on divisive and castiest agenda.<br/>
Coal auction brought in revenue and action on black money has slowed down the generation of black money. Infrastructure building is progressing rapidly and PM personally holds monthly meetings to resolve issues.

                            Dear Dr. Chandan Mitra, you have admitted to the fact that both the BJP president and Prime Minister had both made comments which could have been avoided.... Ba that as it may, now that the electioneering at least in Bihar is over, let's get back to governance and the development focus that the Prime Minister had promised. The nation is going through a tough time and the lives of common man is becoming even more difficult, we can't afford this indulgence in one-up man ship that the political class is constantly engaged in.

                            "Very often there is no basis to imply this claim...", which, LOL, implies that occasionally there is. Which, in turn, refutes your entire argument. There is no picking and choosing acceptable communalism and unacceptable communalism. Communalism is a cancer. And the nature of cancer is to spread and devour the body, if not treated. <br/><br/>
Like you would not brush off 'stray incidents' of cancer, it is foolhardy to think that you can disregard incidents of communalism - stray or otherwise. It tore apart the country in the 1940's and now threatens to once again decimate the fabric of the nation.

                            Does this so called communal card ever work in elections? I doubt it. Our electorate is too mature to be swayed by such canards. If there are communal events they will be influenced just like they will be by political, social and economic events. But just talking about communalism may not serve any political party. Whichever party. There is no empirical evidence for that. It is usually dismissed as electoral rhetoric, which is what it is. Period.

                            You have got both the arguments wrong<br/>
1. Amit Shah's statement: If it does not have any implication on Bihar election, why did your leader invoke it in the first place? He meant that, you are not a patriot if you would like Pakistan to celebrate over BJP's loss in Bihar. By Pakistan, he meant muslims. He clearly meant to invoke "patriotism" mean voting for BJP. That's why it is divisive and communal.<br/>
2. Assuming conclusions on election promises and alleging that OBC community reservation will be taken aback is shrewd and cheap[ politics, that also implies you are trying to make one community insecure. <br/>
The whole world is seeing India as communal and divided on religion today, thanks to your politics. <br/>

                            India would again become tolerant and secular just after the Elections Results and a lot more so if BJP wins. All these media hawks would look for places to hide and every one will shut up. Just watch. <br/>
If BJP does not India would become very intolerant. See the magic.

                            Mr Chandan Mitra is trying to defend the election campaign by BJP to which he is associated. Now where is the need to defend the actions of the leaders of BJP and the POSTER campaign along with the advertisements run in the news papers at the last moment. Does he not know that it is the farmers who sell their animals including the cows for slaughter as it is not viable to sustain them so how do the muslims come into picture. It is sad the a man like Mr Mitra has to indulge in a commentary of this nature and malign the image of other parties. It is all the devious plan of BJP including the GUTTER POLITICS that the election campaigning has been redused to this level. Sad indeed and BJP without any doubt is down right communal.

                            With the Loss of BJP in BIHAR,It is certain that cracker will trust in all provinces of INDIA to celebrate the defeat of BJP which is only functioning as AGENT of CORPORATES..Narendra MODI's intolerance to his opposition is the basic reason for divide in INDIA than any thing .He is famous in one way speech over Radio &amp; TV  as well as on foreign Soil rather to face opposition in parliament and other multiple interacting platform in the Country.Provided BJP do not change their mentality ,They are bound to be shrinked to dwarf.

                            Congress are communal and took a wrong terminology as secular.  Since the days of Nehru, the congress party took a resolution that no one else should rule India and they spoiled every thing and every place. More than Gandhi's name, all the projects, places, awards, airports and everything is named after Nehur or Indira or Rajiv. Funniest part is that nothing is named after Sanjay gandhi.

                            Whatever be the defense there are some things very clear from this entire election which I and probably everyone else have observed, which BJP hopefully learns<br/><br/>
1. The Voters when voting in the BJP did not vote in for the RSS. hence it is very disturbing to see the goverment consulting the RSS, coming to its defence or the RSS coming to BJP defence. It raises questions as to who actually makes the decisions of the goverment.<br/>
2. A lot of things can be attributed to election rhetoric, however when the Prime Minister of the country makes a statement "Nobody will be allowed to take away your reservation and give it to any other community in pursuit of their vote bank politics,"  He automatically shows a difference between communities. No Prime Minister has ever done that. In the eyes of the voters it shows that the Prime Minister views India as different communities not equally as Indians, even if does not mean it.<br/>
3. Playing the pakistan card, frankly does not cut wool and comes across as misdirection.<br/>
4. Prime Minister in so many election speeches, we did not vote for him to be a BJP campaigner.<br/>
5. Beef being made an issue and banned, there are hindu's that eat beef and there are that don't. As far as the cow goes not many cows were being slaughtered anyways. Enforcing ban and lynching due to it have shown BJP in poor light, and the difference in strategy between beef in GOA and other states by BJP itself shows it as using beef to enforce a ideology. The goa chief minister has come across as better balanced then the prime minister of the country, he came out with a statement that beef will be made available<br/>
6. We are getting tired of seeing the BJP appear transfer blame to congress or keep comparing to congress. thats why they were voted out, initial months it was fine. now it sounds like a scratchy tape.

                            Dr. Mitra, its very strange that all these funny comes only from Mr Shah. Whether bursting crackers or Acche din, seems only one person have sense of humor and no one else know to crack jokes.

                            While I don't expect a 'loyal' BJP sevak like yourself to tread the path of defending the words &amp; actions of your party chief, who incidentally has a grand past record of fostering brotherly ties with everyone (pun intended), your line on beef calling it as hindus consuming it as 'disputed' crosses the line.<br/>
I wish to quote from the writings of Dr. B R Ambedkar about the beef eating habits in ancient India..<br/><br/>
"What is the evidence in support of the construction that the Hindus never ate beef and were opposed to the killing of the cow?<br/>
There are two series of references in the Rig Veda on which reliance is placed. In one of these, the cow is spoken of as Aghnya. They are Rig Veda 1.164, 27; IV.1.6; V 82-8; V11.69. 71; X.87. Aghnya means 'one who does not deserve to be killed'. From this, it is argued that this was a prohibition against the killing of the cow and that since the Vedas are the final authority in the matter of religion, it is concluded that the Aryans could not have killed the cows, much less could they have eaten beef. In another series of references the cow is spoken of as sacred. They are Rig Veda V1.28.1.8. and VIII, 101. 15. In these verses the cow is addressed as Mother of Rudras, the Daughter of Vasus, the Sister of the Adityas and the Centre of Nectar. Another reference on the subject is in Rig Veda VIII. 101. 16 where the cow is called Devi (Goddess).<br/>
A similar statement is contained in the Apastambha Dharma Sutra at 1, 5, 17, 29. Apastambha lays a general embargo on the eating of cow's flesh.Such is the evidence in support of the contention that the Hindus never ate beef. What conclusion can be drawn from this evidence?<br/>
So far as the evidence from the Rig Veda is concerned the conclusion is based on a misreading and misunderstanding of the texts. The adjective Aghnya applied to the cow in the Rig Veda means a cow that was yielding milk and therefore not fit for being killed. That the cow is venerated in the Rig Veda is of course true. But this regard and veneration of the cow are only to be expected from an agricultural community like the Indo-Aryans. This application of the utility of the cow did not prevent the Aryan from killing the cow for purposes of food. Indeed the cow was killed because the cow was regarded as sacred. As observed by Mr. P.V. Kane: "It was not that the cow was not sacred in Vedic times, it was because of her sacredness that it is ordained in the Vajasaneyi Samhita that beef should be eaten."<br/>
That the Aryans of the Rig Veda did kill cows for purposes of food and ate beef is abundantly clear from the Rig Veda itself. In Rig Veda (X. 86.14) Indra says: "They cook for one 15 plus twenty oxen". The Rig Veda (X.91.14) says that for Agni were sacrificed horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows and rams. From the Rig Veda (X.72.6) it appears that the cow was killed with a sword or axe.<br/>
As to the testimony of the Satapatha Bramhana, can it be said to be conclusive?<br/>
Obviously, it cannot be. For there are passages in the other Bramhanas which give a different opinion.<br/><br/>
To give only one instance. Among the Kamyashtis set forth in the Taittiriya Bramhana, not only the sacrifice of oxen and cows are laid down, but we are even told what kind and description of oxen and cows are to be offered to what deities. Thus, a dwarf ox is to be chosen for sacrifice to Vishnu; a drooping horned bull with a blaze on the forehead to Indra as the destroyer of Vritra; a black cow to Pushan; a red cow to Rudra; and so on. The Taittiriya Bramhana notes another sacrifice called Panchasaradiya-seva, the most important element of which was the immolation of seventeen five-year old humpless, dwraf-bulls, and as many dwarf heifers under three year-old.....<br/><br/>
That the Hindus at one time did kill cows and did eat beef is proved abundantly by the description of the Yajnas given in the Buddhist Sutras which relate to periods much later than the Vedas and the Brahmanas. The scale on which the slaughter of cows and animals took place was colossal.
