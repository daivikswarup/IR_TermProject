Headline::::Kejriwal's Sexism, Megalomania Stars in TV Ad



DateTime::::2015-06-22T18:16:00+05:30




                                Durga! Durga! What has Arvind Kejriwal gone and done? Have you watched that disgusting "Arvind ke Saath...'' commercial currently playing on multiple channels? Something snapped inside my head when I watched that doodhi (gourd) scene - the one in which the poor doodhi is being skinned (okay, scraped) by an exhausted Tangail-wearing housewife slaving in a tiny kitchen while her laad-saab husband continues to watch television, feet propped up comfortably, surly expression intact. Let's start with the red-bordered Tangail saree, large bindi and those soulful kohl-lined eyes. No getting away from the obvious imagery - she's Bong. Well, yes and no. As anybody who knows anything about Bong housewives will tell you - they would never scrape doodhi. So much for false notes in the much-reviled Kejriwal commercial. A Bong housewife will not go to the market either. Not even to buy 'maach' (fish) for the family. It's the husband who will be dispatched first thing in the morning to make sure he gets the best catch. That's the second false note. This useless husband sits around all day in front of the television, while his wife does the following: she steps out to haggle with the vegetable vendor, and cribs about the high cost of living. She rushes back home, and promptly gets to work. A young son, dressed for school, is seated next to the surly husband who has not moved a single muscle - not even a facial one. The housewife runs out into the street with the brat, hails an autorik, makes sure the meter is on, and rushes back to perform some more domestic chores. She waves an electricity bill at her husband and exclaims ecstatically that it is just a thousand bucks now - all thanks to Kejriwal and his bijli-paani (electricity-water) promises to the people of Delhi. The surly husband barely glances at the bill, and goes back to fixedly watching television.
Then comes the bloody 'doodhi' scene.
Interestingly, it was precisely at this point in the ad commercial that my own husband (not surly at all) reacted strongly. He used a few well-chosen Bengali put-downs to describe the man on the small screen. And expressed his deep sympathy for the wife, still slaving away in the kitchen." Just look at the poor woman.... does that man have no shame?" snorted my outraged husband. Bengali men are like that. They get over-emotional about everything. Even badly-made commercials extolling the virtues of a peculiar neta who is being described as a 'wannabe Messiah' in the media.
Now, if this ridiculously-conceived promo has seriously annoyed a large number of desi men, can you imagine the astronomical number of women it has offended? Socho!
Does Kejriwal's team even know how badly this pitch has misfired? All that humbug about rishwat (bribes), bijli-paani (electricity-water), ghar ka kharcha (household expenses) adds up to zero. What viewers remember is the  intensely annoying, worthless fellow sitting around waiting to be served by an over-burdened wife. That the ad is meant to highlight the great achievements of AAP - sorry, Arvind Kejriwal - escapes most people. Even the few admirers the Muffler Man still has will change their minds after watching this drivel.
What is the 'Essential Message' being conveyed here? Let's see...I perceive just one: Arvind Kejriwal is AAP. AAP is Arvind Kejriwal. Nobody else exists in the party. Nobody needs to.
Then, there is Arvind's very irritating persecution complex that is underlined over and over again. "Why are people after him?" The woman wants to know. The surly husband has nothing to say even on this.
After cooking the wretched doodhi, the wife fills a plate and brings it to the hubby, who still has not budged from his easy chair. She sighs, smiles and sends up a small prayer. For him? For her kid? For their parivaar? Nope! For "Hamara Arvind" (our Arvind). Please note: she wants God to protect Arvind - the individual. Not Arvind and AAP.
Arvind the Megalomaniac? Errrr... is anybody surprised? Kejriwal's narcissistic streak is on parade in this clumsy commercial like never before.
Someone please tell the Dilli ka Chief Minister that India is sick of his self-obsession.
As for those who made this dreadful film, with all its blatantly sexist overtones, may they be force- fed doodhi for the rest of their lives.
And by the way - I don't really know of any self-respecting Bong family that actually eats doodhi  - unless it has a general sprinkling of shrimp in it. 'Lau Chingri'? Bring it on!
Meanwhile, let a scoop-seeking anchor interview Mrs. Kejriwal, preferably in her kitchen, and get her views on this absurd ad. Now, that will be an 'exclusive' worth watching. Even if it isn't shot in Montenegro.(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Kaseriwal is now in fix as to what he should do to keep himself in lime light. He gone for Ad and had brought a question mark on very existence of his party -APP. The poor lady shown in the Ad is struggling a lot like Dehlites and the joker husband like kajeriwal enjoys like any thing. Inference may be drawn from the Ad that kajeriwal is damaging Delhi mercilessly.

                            What nonsense? I saw one AD where a guy comes in a bike and the girl gets down from the car of one boy friends and gets on to the Bike (because the Bike is great to an extent that the girl switches boy friends!!!)<br/><br/>
Is this OK for Shobha De?<br/><br/>
And I saw another movie where four heroines were competing to dance with one Hero. each of them drag the other and joins the hero to dance. <br/><br/>
Is this improving the Woman's Pride?<br/><br/>
It was an AD explaining how a house wife is feeling comfortable after AK took over. It can be a wrong claim and we can discuss. But why is the Author getting to irrelevant things?

                            Agreed with the stereotyped image of an indian house wife shown in the ad but I think you've gone too  much on the Bong woman thing. the ad was projecting typical delhi household not a bengali family. take a break!

Mam, please live up to it and give us a break. Don't stoop low to BJP levels. <br/><br/>
Woman only serving food and doing household chores has been displayed for decades in all tv ads till date for all kitchen appliances (mixers/grinders/juicers/gas burners/refrigerators etc.) or kitchen groceries (aata/refined oils/basmati rice/water purifiers etc). <br/><br/>
Durga! Durga! where were such mocking articles from you then? Sochcho! Sochcho!<br/><br/>
Pick any ad from the past on products I listed above and I'll be proven right.<br/><br/>
Let it be mam, we voters are much more alert and aware these days. Truth will prevail with or without you.

Nice example of a husband set by Shri Narendra Damodardas Modi.

That woman didn't has money to buy vegetables but happy with electricity bill of Rs.3000 per month..!  <br/><br/>
how can one afford Rs.3000 for electricity bill if she doesn't have money to buy vegetables..! For 3000 Rs. electricity bill, monthly income of Home should be more than 40000 to 50000. And in that case, she can afford good quality food including vegetables for her home.<br/><br/>
Either AAP people have no idea about poverty or they want to make it fun by giving Rs.3000 light bill...!

Did she miss all the hara-kiri involving "sahib's" central govt, LG (who wants to be the 'sahib' of Delhi) and Delhi govt? Or is she creating an opinion against Kejriwal by missing the point?<br/><br/>
Also strange that she mentioned a bong family!<br/><br/>
If she is not being a Modi bhakt or Cong chamcha then this time she missed reading the lines itself let alone reading between them!

                            What an absolutely ridiculous piece of writing!While I agree the ad is badly executed, Ms De's article is utterly facetious, frivilous and well, simply put pathetic. Sitting in one's ivory tower, it is easy to object to potrayal of women in the kitchen. But ma'am, once you climb down the tower, you would realise that women cooking and buying vegetables is a rather common occurence in middle and lower-middle class households in Delhi, and indeed, the rest of India. Ever heard the concept of target audience in advertising and marketing? Secondly, as a well-educated, professional woman myself, I find the rather frequent misogynistic comments made by politicians far more offensive than this inocuous and dare I say, pretty accurate ad. I'm surprised that you chose to speak out against this ad, when one look at the TV gives you so many more opportunities to spot sexism and much more devious forms - from saas bahu shows to men's deodorant and fairness cream ads to item nos. by mainstream Bollywood. Given the theory of relativity, I find this ad way mild when compared with some of these other forms of sexism - and indeed the ad being undeserving of this article by you. Finally, messiah syndrome and megalomania did you say? Again, refer to the above mentioned theory of relativity, and notice our less than subtle PM. Oh and that insinuation of the woman in the ad being Bengali - I sure hope you were "just kidding" when you so emphatically delared her a Bengali. Seriously ma'am, I knew you to be a more credible, analytical and just plain better writer than this piece of nonsense.

Guys, this ad smacks of two things mainly - (1) Deceit - Ad says Kejri has saved money by stopping corruption and is paying for the subsidy - Even Cong in its 67 years has not tried to fool people this blatantly. But, he may succeed because poor Delhi voters are gullible unlike the voters in rest of the country!! And (2) Megalo mania - has any party so far, including Cong projected their leader by name so blatantly and directly? No. Deceit / fooling around and Megalo mania are the two things that mark this advertisement. Forget, Sexism, Racism  - they are all nothing in this ad compared to these two characteristics !!

                            Shobhaa De, you write articles that always have more to criticise about than appreciate. I have yet to come across some piece of article from you that doesn't bash anyone. Are you a born hater of things, people, routines, events, festivals, customs, culture and thousand other things including doodhi, Tangail saree, large bindi, Bong etc? And then, did using Bong for Bengali makes you a smart columnist? Can't you spell and write 'Bengali' simply? What if that housewife was wearing any other saree or a small bindi or peeling potato instead of gourd! And who says to you she is Bengali ? Just by saree and bindi! And what if she was wearing salwar kurta or denims? You would have then said "Ohh well, she can't be a housewife as she is not wearing what indian housewives usually wear! Please understand, she could be anyone by religion or culture! Most importantly she is shown as a normal middle class indian housewife which you cannot understand. Just by watching a two minute ad you have made complete Janam patri of that housewife, that husband, Bongs etc. Also you wrote 'surly husband'. 'Surly' means ill-tempered, gloomy or unfriendly. The man in the ad is shown only for 2-3 seconds and in that your divine vision found him surly! Husband watching TV, while sipping Tea is surly!! Where did you get that? And if this ad is sexist, you can find sexism in every third ad running on TV and almost in every second  hindi film. But you have an insatiable need to bash something or someone. Thats all that matters to you. If you don't find the ad comfortable then don't watch it. Simple. And please Shobhaa De, Stop bashing people and their lives. You just downgrade everyone's life with your writing. Don't pass your judgements! No one needs that. You have no understanding of the street life, people, their fears, their daily struggle and what keeps them alive! You are better in writing fiction. Stay so.

                            It looked like a DOordarshan ad of the 80s and 90s. Of course AAP supporters will want Kejriwal to be given more time and opportunities to make mistakes as he is new. Only BJP will be denied the chance to make any mistakes as they are not secular. Secular parties can make as many mistakes as possible - 1.7 lakh crore scam, fodder scam, and so on and learn on the job.<br/><br/>
It's not even 1 year of the Delhi govt and they are getting into self adulatory mode? <br/><br/>

                            Shobha dey got it right...and I am sure the ad has been reviewed by AK before going live..I heard him saying things which later become part of their ad campaign. For eg: modi for pm and ak for cm. AK is just a greedy person who's using people to fulfill his own political ambition. AAP is just for name sake. Tomorrow if he's been offered pm post with bjp or congress he'll not think even for a sec to grab the opportunity. He's that dum fellow! God save Delhi...

                            on the onset, I too believe that most of us would agree to the fact that the ad is focused on major portion of Indian society. It wasn't meant to painted sexist. Has our definition for "sexist" came down to such an extend that some people seem agreeing to Shobaa De!!!<br/>
Believe it or not, it is the status of most Indian lower middleclass society. Don't agree, please tune up to this channels interview with wives who have lost their husbands in the latest hooch tragedy in Mumbai.<br/>
Also the ad I feel, could have made a little more appealing but slamming comments like sexist is well above all reasons.

                            I honestly do not care about the family dynamic or the cusine they serve on the table.<br/><br/>
What troubles me is incessant need to play the victim – by ‘Arvind'. Was this an advert to promote the ‘collective work' done by the Aam Admi Party? Hell no!!<br/><br/>
This piece of tasteless ‘film making' was a shameless, failed attempt to safeguard the spoils of a cry baby – "pata nahi sabh Kejriwal ke peeche kyun pade hain." – This is nothing but a serious case of absolutism showcased by a man losing (like he had it!) it.

                            What an absolutely ridiculous piece of writing! While I agree the ad is badly executed, Ms De's article is utterly facetious, frivolous and well, simply put pathetic. Sitting in one's ivory tower, it is easy to object to portrayal of women in the kitchen. But ma'am, once you climb down the tower, you would realise that women cooking and buying vegetables is a rather common occurrence in middle and lower-middle class households in Delhi, and indeed, the rest of India. Ever heard of the concept of target audience in advertising and marketing? Secondly, as a well-educated, professional woman myself, I find the rather frequent misogynistic comments made by our politicians far more offensive than this innocuous and dare I say, almost accurate ad. I'm surprised that you chose to speak out against this ad, when one look at the TV gives you so many more opportunities to spot sexism and in much more biting forms - from saas bahu shows to men's deodorant (scantily clad women being seduced by men's deos!) and women's fairness cream ads to item nos. by mainstream Bollywood. Given the theory of relativity, I find this AAP ad way mild when compared with some of these other forms of sexism - and indeed the ad being undeserving of this article by you. Finally, messiah syndrome and megalomania did you say? Again, refer to the above mentioned theory of relativity, and notice our less than subtle and epitome of narcissism PM. Oh and that insinuation of the woman in the ad being Bengali - I sure hope you were "just kidding" when you so emphatically declared her a Bengali. Seriously ma'am, I knew you to be a more credible, analytical and just plain better writer than this piece of nonsense.

All those who tried to bring in some rational or curb down his dictatorial attitude were kicked out of party.... This guy is trying to feed on the sympathy of people now .... As all odds r against him...... It's like all good that happens is thanks to Khujliwal anything that goes wrong is central govt planning against him - this foul crying is over now people can see through his hollow claims.... An important observation - this free / lower cost Bijli-Paani is a shaam... People who are writing comments here or who are middle class / upper middle class are barely impacted given the criteria of meeting 400 units of bijili used per/month is anyways not met by most and same goes for water. It's only for his vote bank - illegal colonies / JJ colonies whom he is trying to regularized.

                            Either most of you don't watch Indian television at all or are filled with hatred against AAP. I don't endorse AK's views most of the times and i do believe he has issues with his delivery. However, if this is sexists then almost 90% of the other ads running on Indian television 24X7. Health drinks, washing powder, fairness creams, matrimonial ads, shoes, kids clothing, diapers and many mores. Open your eyes and see how women are portrayed in these commercials and then compare it to AAP's ad.

                            Actually this ad from Dehli Government depicting dudhee  is directed at Supreme  Court.  It has banned photo graphs of Chief Ministers in Government ads,  (but ok if it prints CJI photo ). Since photo of Kejriwal  is  not allowed, his name is repeatedly taken. Now,  I find that all NGOs are busy filling their forms and submitting to GOI and so could not file PIL in SC to  stop this ad on Kejri. Hope soon they  will get back their cheque books  and will have Green-Peace with Rajnaath and file PIL in SC.   However all is not lost .. none of the other 28  CMs are as clever as Kejri and so we are saved from seeing , Vasundhara, Anandiben, Mamata, Jaylalita ...  and off course CSR on the screen.

                            Shobha, are you worried about how the ad has been made or the fact that whether  Arvind's claim correct. Arvind's claim is more for people to judge and decide so you don't need to worry about it. As for the AD and your problem with depiction of Bengali woman, surly husband and doodhi, I think you are feeling offended being a Bengali yourself. But let me tell you, most of Indian MIDDLECLASS husband may look the same which is a hard fact for you to swallow. And I find this strange when you don't write article on ads showing filmy punjabis, gujju and madrasis. Please don't try to get more readers by jumping into something controversial.

                            Seriously, Shobha De you are completely disconnected with Indian Society a woman cooking or working while the husband looks on passively shows reality as it is. If anything I feel it shows an intelligent woman who is empowered by knowledge of what is going on around her. If you did not know Wonen are the finance ministers of a home. Also what is wrong showing the woman cook would you take issue if a man was fixing his car ? There is nothing sexist about it. Oh I forgot you must have servants cook for you right?

                            Shobha was so near and yet so far in her interpretation of the ad.  She was perfectly correct in alluding to the sheer indolence of the husband.  And yet there is a little 'Bong' or as she describes him, a brat.  She should have put two and two together immediately!  Did she really think that a guy who couldn't even be bothered to move a facial muscle would be able to move another part of his body such that 9 months later a 'brat' is mysteriously produced?  Of course not!  Further, Shobha obviously did not notice the remarkable similarity of the brat to Lord Kejriwal!  Shobha has fallen well short of her investigative skills; otherwise, by now, she would have obtained an RTI and, through DNA tests confirmed that Lord Kejriwal has not always been doing only dharnas; he has also been doing bedroom dramas.  Those in the know will confirm that previously he had asked members of the public to carry out sting operations on the sub-standard 'doodhis' being offloaded on a weary Delhi public.  The housewife under scrutiny claimed that she had video evidence of such a matter and invited Lord Kejriwal to carry out a personal inspection.  Naturally, while this was happening, the husband did not move a muscle.  Kejriwal, however did.  The result is the brat shown on the ad.  No wonder the housewife asks God to protect Kejriwal.  Kejriwal is, after all a politician in  India and generally, politicians in India ensure that their offspring  succeed them to high political office.  One only has to look at Indira, Rajiv, Rahul, Thakeray, Pilot, Scindia and various others.  Just because Lord Kejriwal is an 'aam' aadmi, it doesn't mean he cannot emulate 'khas' politicians in passing on high office!  I trust Shobha will mend her ways and respect Kejriwal's right to have the public pay for such ads; how else would his offspring succeed him?

                            Its really annoying and i guess how much have they paid -as the ad keeping coming coming up on all channels every few minutes. now that megalomania may have two things to offer - the add was aired by opposition as bjp is scared or he will say I am sorry since i am just a pig.

                            Ms De , this time you could not understand the crafty Arvindji .. He wants to keep the women voters intact with this Advt. Not everyone feels annoyed at being shown doing household work , rather they feel more secure being shown importance of their work . Please keep in mind that not every woman have a kismat , connections and Soch  like you !<br/>
