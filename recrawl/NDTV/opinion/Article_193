Headline::::I Support Modi's Birthday Cake Move. But What Next?



DateTime::::2015-12-26T21:48:00+05:30




                                There is a saying about trying to find a taxi when it's raining, you can be waiting for ages for one and then all of a sudden, three of them will arrive at the same time. Of late, official meetings between the governments of India and Pakistan seem to be following a similar pattern - we don't have any for the better part of 15 months, and then, all of a sudden, we have three different meetings almost back-to-back.
There was no indication of any ice breaking before the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers found themselves in Paris attending climate talks aimed at staving off global warming. Suddenly we were treated to visuals of the two men locked in a huddle, engaged in a discussion that was anything but a simple exchange of pleasantries. As much as officials tasked with explaining the chat tried to play down thing, the pictures told their own story. This was followed soon after by the announcement that the National Security Advisors of the two countries had met in Bangkok. According to the official release, put out after the talks, the scope of this dialogue had been widened after the Ufa declaration to include Kashmir as well.
The ink on the articles written to analyse this development had barely started to dry when the next episode was announced - Sushma Swaraj was to travel to Islamabad to attend a regional conference for Afghanistan. Ostensibly a multi-lateral event, but with weighty bilateral overtones including a meeting between her and the Pakistani Prime Minister. The significant announcement from this visit was the reiteration of the intent of Prime Minister Modi to visit Pakistan in 2016 for the SAARC summit.
I don't think anyone saw the developments of Christmas 2015 coming, and those that now claim to have foreseen or influenced what happened are clearly suffering from delusions of grandeur. For a Prime Minister whose domestic agenda has been predictable, some would even whisper downright disappointing, his foreign policy has been anything but. He's a leader who has continued to surprise observers, yours truly included. He started with the invitation to the heads of government of neighbouring countries to attend his swearing-in. He trumped that with the invitation to President Obama as chief guest for Republic Day. While his engagements with countries like the US, UK and Japan have been hailed, his track record with neighbouring countries has been, at best, mixed.
The 25th of December started out as Christmas Day would, Good Governance Day having been quietly buried. Prime Minister Modi was on his way back from Moscow and was expected to make a brief stop in Kabul on the way back. Suddenly, completely out of the blue, the PM tweeted that he was going to "drop by" in Lahore on his was back from Kabul to meet Nawaz Sharif. As simple as that, no big build up, no "official sources'' suggesting what might be in the pipeline, just that tweet to turn Christmas on its head. I can well imagine newsrooms erupting, commentators and experts being roused from their afternoon slumber and everyone scrambling to make sense of what was happening.
To put some perspective on this, let's go back less than three months, 29th of September to be exact, when the two leaders were in New York for the UN General Assembly. The two Prime Ministers didn't even shake hands, much less have any sort of meeting. All we got were reports, again denied by Indian officials in spite of video images to the contrary, of the two leaders waving at each other across a room. So in under three months, we've gone from a wry wave to "Nawaz Bhai, I'm flying over your home and am going to drop by for a quick chai pe charcha and a slice of birthday cake". That's the bit the boggles the mind and the part I'd like explained to me by the Government and the BJP - what changed in under three months? What did those of us who keenly watch Indo-Pak developments miss?
I'm a dove, or a peacenik if you prefer that term, and make no bones of that fact. I've been a strong supporter of a sustained dialogue with Pakistan covering all issues, especially Kashmir. What I don't have much of a stomach for is grand gestures that steal the headlines and a couple of news cycles, but don't translate in to anything meaningful on the ground. Unfortunately we've seen too many of those to be anything but disappointed by them. What this relationship needs is a sustained dialogue, with small steps taken to achieve concrete results that can all add up to build confidence in the process, a process that must ultimately resolve the Kashmir issue. That would require maturity, sagacity and a statesman-like approach, often shunning the headlines, so that we can get things done without the pressure of pandering to domestic constituencies. It would also require engagement with Pakistan at various levels of the government and cutting across ministries to build the required depth and scope in the relationship to rebuild confidence. I think it's fair to say that it would help to take the opposition on board and brief them about what is happening so that they can be made part of the process. It doesn't help to have the opposition undermining the government's efforts in a very public way, but if they aren't taken on board, then it's bound to be the natural reaction of the opposition leadership. Perhaps another round of chai, this time in Delhi with the Congress leadership wouldn't be a bad idea. Certain aspects of the Indo-Pak relationship need to be taken out of the arena of domestic political squabbles.
I'm not a believer in the tooth fairy and I stopped believing in Father Christmas a very long time ago so no, I don't believe the Lahore visit was a spur of the moment decision. It would have taken some amount of planning to put the logistics into place, so I can only hope that the next few steps have been thought through as well. What next? We've had the grand gesture and the big photo op so, what happens next? Have we built in the necessary safeguards to insulate this process from something like a terror strike in J&K or a state election defeat? Is there an end goal we have in mind that we are working towards? What happens when the chai runs cold and the really ticklish issues have to come up for discussion? I hope someone in the corridors of power has the answers to these questions, because if they don't then all we will have at the end of the day is a lot of egg, or would you prefer birthday cake, on a lot of faces, and a massive pile of disappointment. On the other hand, if someone has through the this one through, then we may be on to something here. I for one will be keenly watching what the new year has in store on this front, so on that note here's wishing you all a happy and peaceful 2016.(Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It can't be coincidence that you and the economist had the similar thoughts in an article about finding transportation on rainy day, is it mr. abdullah?<br/><br/>
Now about your real content - let an outsider like mr. modi try things out even if they don't work out. We saw enough of what the dynasties like your party and congress did till date.

                            One hopes that even as the US troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan are not made to secure Afghanistan using their security forces. It would simply transfer problems from the USA's shoulders to (economically) frail shoulders of India and Pakistan

                            The world super power's politics and foreign policy is driven by the business houses. Scripted, floated and funded by the who's who of corporate world. From Columbus to East India company, and now the current super power or rather Super business houses; the driving force and the motivation has remain the same. Coincidentally, Modi represent the who's who of Indian business houses and Nawab Sharif himself is the business baron. the chemistry and the love between these two had to florish. but the the million dollar question will be, whether it has the blessing of Raheel Shareef?

                            The events unfolding is not in a novel or a story book that a person can finish reading it in a day or two and know how the plot ends. Give the events time to build up and reach some kind of logical end. It is also quite possible that the experiment may have to be jettisoned midway if the anticipated results are not to our liking or benefit. Mr. Omar Abdullah, since you have had a long innings in the political arena should be aware of this. But just because the results are not immediately visible does not mean that no action should be taken. I know that for your own personal and political reasons, you are against the present government at the center, but if you have a better alternative, why don't you spell it out.<br/><br/>
In the last 18 months, we have seen that politicians like you and your ilk have been criticizing anything that the center has been attempting. So much so, that the parliament is also not being allowed to function with the Congress saying that the Government is offering so many chances to protest. The opposition should realize that they have a responsibility to the country and have to act maturely. Even if the Government gives them a cafeteria of reasons to protest, they are not beholden to take advantage of the same.

                            Keep guessing. It's difficult to understand Chanakya neeti by morons. Next is the move for complete surrender of Kashmir to the sovereignty of Bharat as proposed by Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherji and revoke of article 370. Either Kashmir will be in India or be a new Pakistan and get attacked by your Messiahs, ISIS. And then Next is implementation of Uniform Civil Code in Bharat.

                            The way forward should be based on the following:<br/>
- In the short term there is no solution to Kashmir dispute other than maintaining status quo. <br/>
- Human issues such as rehabilitation of Pandits and promotion of peace through converting J&amp;K as a normal and yet another state should be continued.Human Rights issues should be handled on both sides.<br/>
- In the mid-term promote trade and tourism, convert India, Pakistan and Afghanistan as a seamless region.  Defocus on terrorism, focus on trade, gas pipelines and so on.<br/>
- Close out trial of 26/11.<br/>
- In the longer term work for an Indian Union in the lines of European Union.In larger scheme of things territorial disputes do not affect normal people.<br/>
- Promote Hinduism enough to not get swamped by other religions.

                            The tones in this op-ed suggest that Mr Abdullah, seasoned and matured politician as he is, is silently praying for Mr Modi's diplomacy towards Pakistan to fail so he can proudly say, "I told you so!" The only reason to ask these questions is to what to attack next. If the Pakistan policy is made completely public, they shred it apart finding non-existent holes in the policies. If it isn't, they come shouting from the rooftops saying they hope the Prime Minister knows what he's doing.<br/>
The simple fact of the matter is that a very public Pakistan policy hasn't worked for the easy to comprehend reason that, on both sides, the opposition doesn't want the establishment to succeed in progressing at all, even at cost of national interests. Back-channel negotiations along with unannounced public postures is the way to go!

                            You need to think about the Indo Pak process like a game of soccer / football, played in slow motion, with the press and others analyzing every pass of the ball. In soccer, the objective is to get the ball into the opponent's net, but sometimes you kick the ball towards your own goal when going simply forward doesn't make sense. Its all part of a strategy. Imagine if every ball kick towards your own goal was criticized. But that is what Congress and their allies are doing.

                            Perhaps, Modi first wanted to focus on visiting countries where there are business interests. He has more or less visited major countries that are relevant. Other issues/countries are essentially drain on time and resources; nothing concrete is expected? We know that; dont we?
