Headline::::Apologies to Dengue Patients, AAP Will Try Harder



DateTime::::2015-09-17T16:18:00+05:30




                                It is sad and tragic that people in Delhi are dying of Dengue, a disease which has been eradicated by many countries like China and Vietnam. The Dengue havoc has become an annual ritual and as a country we have still not woken up. This is an extreme form of insensitivity and callousness. And institutions are still busy in a blame game. Political parties are also losing no time in scoring brownie points.
I belong to a political party, and since my party governs Delhi, I take the blame if any one dies due to negligence or any slackness on behalf of government agencies. It is a sad commentary on a city that is considered to be the most developed in terms of infrastructure and preparedness, and also about its understanding of this sort of disease. If five hospitals are refusing to admit a critical patient - a young boy - in Delhi, then one can well imagine the situation in small cities away from the media glare. Last night, as I was watching the news, I saw a story from Agra, again not very far from Delhi, of a hospital where stretchers are used to remove dirt, and beds are sleeping places for dogs. I have also seen a news item in which an untrained lab assistant was performing a surgery. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The fact is that Health and Education have not topped the agenda in India since independence and it's still the most neglected dimension of civil governance and administration. There has always been a demand by a section of the society to increase the education budget to 6%, but till now of no avail.
It's a basic obligation of civilized society to provide universal education and health to citizens. No system of governance, be it capitalism or communism, has been able to do justice to its citizens despite tall claims by both systems. US President Barack Obama has been trying to convince his friends in the US Congress and Senate to pass legislation for ObamaCare. While flipping through history books, I could find only a few countries that have attained near-perfect success in the health sphere. Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Sweden, Finland are a few.  And a debate has ensued in the US to learn from these countries.
I can understand that the AAP government in Delhi is also blamed for the unpreparedness and lack of infrastructure to handle an epidemic like situation. It's a fact that after taking over the reins of the government, AAP ministers had made a concrete plan to tackle the Dengue scare. In the month of June and July, Health Minister, Satyendra Jain held a press conference for a briefing on Dengue preparedness. Based on  2014 data when 1,000 dengue patients had been counted across the capital, it was assumed that this number could go up to 2,500 and accordingly, beds for dengue patients in state-run hospitals were increased by 300%. In the month of August, pain killers like Aspirin and Brufen were banned by Delhi as consumption of these medicines lowers the platelet count in the body. The Health Minister himself held three meetings with MCD commissioners, and the Health Secretary was made the nodal officer to coordinate with the MCD for fumigation and killing of mosquitoes, its eggs and larvae, and to spread awareness among citizens against water collecting in homes and neighbourhoods because that becomes the breeding ground for Dengue mosquitoes.
I still believe that this preparedness is not enough as Delhi has five kinds of hospitals administered by five different agencies like - central government, state government, MCD, army and private. The Safdarjung hospital, for example, which allegedly refused admission to the six-year-old child who died is run by the central government. Another one which allegedly refused admission is the Jeevan Hospital which is privately owned. In my opinion, there should be only two kinds of hospitals: state-run and privately-owned. The Centre, MCD and Army should relinquish their jurisdiction over hospitals. That should be left with state government for uniform and efficient administration.
There are serious complaints against private hospitals. They seem to have become a money-making machine and these hospitals are fleecing patients. They don't even honour their commitment to provide 25% beds and medicines to poor people at no cost - a basic condition of them getting land at highly discounted rates. The Delhi Act of 1953 is not competent to deal with erring doctors and hospitals. It levies a fine of Rs. 1,000 rupees fine and a month's notice for seeking explanations.
It is clear that to avoid a situation like this, a systemic solution has to be found. Education and Health have to be brought to the top of the governance pyramid. They have been at the bottom for too long. It is now time to wake up. With this understanding, the AAP government has increased the education budget by 106% and health budget by 46% for this financial year. The AAP government plans to establish 1,000 high-quality neighbourhood health clinics in Delhi. One such model clinic has already been created on a pilot basis at Indira Awas Colony, near Peeragadhi Chowk. These clinics require doctors and infrastructure, and the state government has requested civil Society, citizens and corporate houses to come  forward and exercise their social responsibility. The AAP government is also in touch with the British National Health Services (NHS) which has been highly appreciated for its innovative health schemes. The Health Minister made a visit to coordinate this to the UK recently.
This will take some time. This will not happen overnight. But once we succeed in putting a system in place and make every one aware that Dengue can be curbed at a preventive level, a scare of this level will not happen.
I hope that in three to four years' time we are in a situation to say that Dengue is a matter of the past. Till then my apologies to the families of the patients.

                            this guys writes the most irritating articles usually but this one is a bit ok ...but still his facts are wrong . Dengue has not not been eradicated in China and Vietnam : <br/><br/>
From WHO site: <br/><br/>
In 2013, cases have occurred in Florida (United States of America) and Yunnan province of China. Dengue also continues to affect several South American countries, notably Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico. In Asia, Singapore has reported an increase in cases after a lapse of several years and outbreaks have also been reported in Laos. In 2014, trends indicate increases in the number of cases in the People's Republic of China, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Malaysia and Vanuatu, with Dengue Type 3 (DEN 3) affecting the Pacific Island countries after a lapse of over 10 years. Dengue was also reported in Japan after a lapse of over 70 years. In 2015 an increase in the number of cases was reported in Brazil and several neighbouring countries. The Pacific island countries of Fiji, Tonga and French Polynesia have continued to record cases.

                            well , in 2014 it was 1000 cases so in 2015 u made arrangements for 2500 cases , mate seriously thats the most insensitive statement , u should be going for 0 cases in 2015 rather than 2500 , thats statement itself shows your mindset , u want to treat patient and not prevent people from getting it , u could have spent just a few lakhs in the last few weeks before the index case this year to try to eradicate mosquiotoes , by fogging , or atleast after the cases started appearing , wonder where are those SPM professors and HOD of the medical colleges , who should have been on the ground directing the municipal workers . <br/>
this is a scenario where only professionals like the SPM ( social and preventive medicine ) professors need to handle , not a lallo, panju aiyra gayra like jain or Nadda ,the govt should appoint a team from the SPM depts and should be asking that team questions rather than shooting out of the mouth by all and sundry . itching to fly out to delhi on my own and start taking things in my hands to prevent further cases rather than those imbeciles ,

Please do your work instead of writing stupid things here and there. More you  write more the stupidity of AAP exposes. Remember your Ad? "Woh Pareshan karte rahe, hum kaam karta raha", now add this lines as well "..aur .....in between machchar barte rahe hum kuch na kar saka". And one more thing... today in this holy occasion of  Ganesh Chaturthi and Vishwakarma Puja if you cry once again then this day would be a memorable no doubt...and all of us agree to that.

                            All welfare states of the world focus on three issues for the wellbeing of the people : health, education and promoting small businesses. So this govt isnt too far off the mark when its targetting these areas for the betterment of aam aadmi's life.<br/><br/>
But the AAP govt will do well to remember that While the NHS model has several positives worth emulating it is also an expensive model. This year's NHS budget is GBP 115billion. Compare that to the current year's budgetary expenditure of the indian govt at about GBP 56billion.And also worth remembering NHS services a population of only 65 million with that budget.<br/><br/>
Doctors working for NHS meet no more than 5-8 patients in a day. Indian doctors sometimes meet as many as 80 patients in a day. <br/><br/>
Personally I believe the practices from NHS that can be emulated at an affordable cost have to do with the heavily networked knowledge database that they have created. Not only does it maintain patient treatment histories and test reports, the knowledge base also has standardized diagnostic and treatment methodologies for common ailments that medical practitioners are expected to follow. <br/><br/>
UK also has laws that holds NHS doctors accountable in case of medical negligence. So the NHS system is built to not only to support the medical fraternity but to also challenge if good practices arent followed. The system also relies on good quality training and accredition practices for medical professionals.

We have now seen the true face of AAP,it's a shame that you first come to power on promises of clean image,no corruption slogan and then one by one you do anything and everything that all the other parties do.Everytime any one asks any of your leaders for any explanation you start pointing fingers on others .Really disappointing<br/><br/>
At least other parties have some leader face if not may be now then at least in the past they have produced great leaders but seeing the present condition of AAP,am quite confident there was never and there will never be a true leader.

                            To little to late. Dengue fever comes every year. This isn't like sarrs or other diseases that cane out of the blue. This aap guys should have been prepared. That is why people are angry. It was known and predictable. Happens every year. And yet aap did not prepare. This just shows aap is not fit to govern.

                            Whereas I do agree that AAP should quit apologising each time things go wrong but that does not excuse the venom displayed by some of those commenting .What is with us Indians that we cannot  enter a debate/argument without getting offensively personal ???<br/>
AAP may not be the ideal political party to govern Delhi but they are making an effort which is more than can be said about the Modi Sarkar. So far the latter has shown no ability to manage contradictions which is the very basic requirement of Democracy ....the ability to take people of different opinions along with you. Witness their ham handed arrogant attempt to push through the GST and  Land Bill....their performance in the Rajya Sabha where they were challenged was pathetic. Same with their handling of the OROP ....they have ended up with offending all the Veterans and then in a desperate bid to appear to have solved the problem they have ordered total censorship of all the Veteran activities so no discontent on the part of the Veterans comes out.!!<br/><br/>
Seriously , all you Modi fans , is this a democratic way to solve issues ? If someone does not comply simply hit him over the head to force compliance ? Please think rationally ....is this what we voted Modi in for .....so he can destroy all institutions that dare to oppose him including the Armed Forces ???<br/><br/>
If AAP is constantly involved in "fighting" with the Central Govt at least read carefully what they are fighting for ? Is it wrong to demand that the CM should be responsible for law and order in his state therefore the police MUST answer to him and his Govt ?? Is it wrong to expect the CM to choose his own staff ? People he relates to and to whom he can confidently delegate certain jobs ? Is it wrong for a CM to expect complete loyalty from his core staff ? Is that not the way most well run companies run? If  you agree with me then why do you constantly hit out at AAP even when their demands are completely justified ....how can any Chief Minister function with constant interference from the Central Govt ? Yes, you may say Shiela Dixit did not have so many issues  but then in the areas of law and order and MCD related issues her Govt was found totally lacking....in fact it was this anger that led to her removal . Why should AAP not learn from those years? Why should they make the same compromises? Please stop this habit of unconstructive criticism ....make valuable suggestions that this nascent Govt can consider !

They can ill afford hospitalisation, medicines etc. Also the APP MLAs and volunteers should ensure that the garbage and clogged drains are cleaned. Must be done on a war footing......people of Delhi know that this is a man made disaster by the BJP/MCD to discredit APP.

                            Does Mr. Ashutosh know how the NHS in funded in UK??<br/>
more than 98% of the funding for NHS comes via taxes and National Insurance levy that every earning member has to pay for.<br/>
Not just this, NHS has huge financial constraints and as per all reports it will not be sustainable for a very long time.<br/><br/>
The population in UK is much much less as compared to India and also the % of relatively high earning people in the UK is much higher than in India. So my question is this, UK can afford a system like the NHS but can India???

if the time and money would have been spent in dengue, many problems would have solved.<br/>
You guys have time to campaign in Bihar &amp; DU and enjoying the DJs by spending 2 crore of publc money but when health comes, you say the Cost is not allocated from Central Govt.<br/><br/>

Mr Ashutosh - how about focussing on governance and preventing deaths rather than coming on news channels and blogs apologizing every time for death of common people. Better still - why dont you just go back to TV journalism rather than get your embarrassed every time!

                            Its also worth noting that NHS provides a cradle to grave service to all Britons. A high proportion of its expense comes from treating the elderly and also those whose medical conditions are self afflicted eg alcoholics and drug addicts.<br/><br/>
Any govt that wishes to follow the same model would do well to assess the most prevalent and debilitating health risks and potentially focus on those for treatment to keep its costs low. Diagnostics is one are where a lot of money is wasted. This service could be prioritized. So could accidents and emergencies. Pregnant mothers and children can be prioritized. Issues of public health like Dengue, malaria, TB, bronchial diseases can be prioritized as well<br/>
Providing generic low cost drugs is another area to focus on.<br/><br/>
Preventive health care is another area (through exercise regimen and good nutrition) where there is no clash of interests for a publically funded healthcare system.

                            I agree with Ashutosh about the paltry attention given to Health and Education in India. Regarding private hospitals, I remember going to donate platelets to a patient of dengue in a hospital, and the doctor refused because he said "my veins were too deep to be found" He rejected about 4-5 donors my group had brought for the same reason. Later, I confirmed with numerous doctors, and none of them said that it is possible for a doctor to not "find" veins. Its a nystery why he refused to take blood when donors were available.

                            Dengue calamines in the country like many other natural calamities like earth quakes , floods, starvation due to poverty etc causing large scale deaths has bound to happen since we have been going against law of nature. Nature does not permit so much population pressure in the country. Otherwise also it is a fact that exceptionally high unmanageable population has made us sick being the most undisciplined nation.   Naturally unless some remedial measures are taken immediately we will leave nothing for our future generations except sorrowful legacy. Best solution will be limiting one child per couple, withdrawing some or all   of the Govt. incentives to couples with two children and imposing a sort of annual fine per child per year  to couples having more than two children, in future, as successfully experimented by China during last four decades. Clear signal is ACT OR PERISH.

                            Ashutoshji, sack the MCD. They won't comply no matter what you do or say.

                            Aap failed miserably here and they know it. So instead of sincerely  recognizing their fault, they are making excuses and claiming not to play politics. That is another term for please don't call me out for my inaction and incompetence. It is a really bad attempt at damage control. This is one of many things that will end aap very very soon.

                            Thank you for theoretical lecture. Your minister preparedness is to have press meet. Beyond that nothing seems to be happening in Delhi. Speak about what is the budgetary allocation you have done to hospitals, how well you are paying Doctors. Most of the medicos in the country suffer due to govt apathy towards them. Do you even know how much money it costs to the meritorious general merit student to get educated in medicinal science? Do you know how the difficulties of running private hospitals - question on what institutional support your govt gives to them. Just giving them a land - will that suffice to cover the running expence. While you have all the budget to  support Mr. Kejriwal's egoistic advertisement, you have not even increased the budgetary allocations to the hospitals, not even cared for the 100 of doctors who is working over time to address.

                            I think you should spend more time in things like DUSU elections. What happened to the extra budget on medical ? All rubbish .
