Headline::::Giriraj Singh's Crude Racism Does Real Damage



DateTime::::2015-04-02T14:13:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)
	24 hours after using Congress President Sonia Gandhi as the foil for a racist remark, Giriraj Singh and the Narendra Modi government he represents seem blissfully unaware of the damage this witlessness has done to India's relations with Nigeria, and to its standing with the African continent as a whole.
	 
	To the loud guffaws of his supporters, the Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises can be seen on video saying, "If Rajiv Gandhi had married a Nigerian lady, someone not white-skinned, would the Congress have accepted her as its leader?"
	 
	If you see the video, two things become apparent. The political target is obviously Sonia, but the real joke as far as the BJP leader and his chamchas are concerned is the idea of Rajiv Gandhi actually marrying a Nigerian woman. They are laughing at the mental image that Giriraj fleetingly conjures of a Nigerian woman ordering Congressmen around. The laughter is not at the notion of men following the orders of a woman in general, but those of an African woman, a black woman, a dark-skinned woman. You wouldn't even marry such a woman, the sub-text is, let alone place political power in her hands. Hilarious, isn't it?
	 
	Under attack from the Congress and other parties, Giriraj Singh has made some lame attempts at damage control. First, he insisted the offensive statement was made "off the record" and should not have been publicized, a strange defence because in politics, racism and misogyny are not acceptable even when they are expressed "privately". Second, he said that if Sonia Gandhi was indeed upset by his remark, then he was prepared to apologise for it. Nowhere has the minister acknowledged that he was wrong to say what he did. Full stop. Most shocking of all, to my mind, is his failure to apologise to Nigeria, despite that country's envoy to India already expressing his anger at the racist suggestion that Nigerian women are in some way inferior to whites or Indians.
	 
	Sonia Gandhi has heard worse in the past from other representatives of the BJP and Sangh Parivar, and Giriraj Singh's racism has already been seized upon by the Congress to embarrass the Modi government. My concern here is with the diplomatic fall-out. Later this year, New Delhi is going to play host to the India-Africa summit, a major foreign policy initiative, in which the leaders of all 54 African nations have been invited to attend. The only time such a large number of African leaders have gathered in one place outside the continent was in 2006 in Beijing for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
	 
	We are used to the common-place prejudices in our society against dark skin colour, to the preference of fair over dark and the lucrative business that thrives on selling the chimera of whiteness to millions and millions of Indians by robbing them of their self-confidence and self-esteem. This is a battle that Indian civil society will have to fight. But when Indian racism begins to hurt other peoples and countries - be they African students and migrants in India, or the feelings of an entire continent - action by the government has to be swift and immediate.
	 
	Narendra Modi does not believe in taking questions from journalists, but I would like to ask him this: do you really think having a crude racist like Giriraj Singh in your cabinet, a man who can mock a major African country, will improve India's diplomatic standing in the continent and help make the impending summit with African nations a success? Would any major power aspiring to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council continue to reward such politicians with ministerial positions?
	 
	Nigeria, like many other African countries, is also host to a thriving Indian community, many of whom have lived there for decades. The Indians in Africa have done well for themselves, and for India; they have preserved their national identity and language but are far more comfortable speaking the languages of their adopted homeland - Hausa, Yoruba, Swahili, Wolof, Lingala - than migrants from, say, China. The crude racism of Giriraj Singh and the failure of the Prime Minister to sack him  - or even publicly reprimand him  - are an affront to Africa, an embarrassment to the Indian diaspora, and a slap in the face of Indian diplomacy.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            We now know that Narendra Modi is a weak personality. If he cannot change people in BJP to behave properly, how can he change the country? Too much talk and touring by him. Much less work on the ground front. Unfortunate for India

                            I bet this is not specific to BJP politicians alone ...Our media angels jump at BJP coz it happens to be a BJP politician.... Did they ask about Digvijay "Tunch Maal" singh or Mulayal " boys only" yadav? <br/><br/>
This class bevahiour is not specific to BJp... Siddharth should not protect the average Congress or SP or BSP or DMK male politician and use this opportunity for Modi Bashing... its the craze of white skin that we acquired from a deep rooted hatred for our own... our own skin., our own language, culture, langauges and academics.....Thanks to Macaulay and years of this education system we haev  such deep inferiority complex of our OWN and assume everything that is FIRANGI is pure and better and even worship them.... Thus is the fair an lovely generation cultivated !!!!!

                            Excellent article Mr. SIddarth Varadarajan, and thank you for putting the issue in the right perspective. I saw the debates in all the channels and the focus was more on the affront to Women, Sonia Gandhi &amp; Indian Women. Not one of them seemed to understand that the real affront was to people from African origin. The damage that has been caused is to India-Africa relationship, Racial Slur on African people, shown India's racial bias (at least this leader) and endangered the Indian's living in Africa. Hope people like Samvit Patra understand this before engaging in debates and the Prime Minister the gravity of the damage done by this errant ignorant minister.

                            Absolutely Right - These fringe elements and comments are becoming very embarrassing for govt. All the devt and clean govt work take back seat with all these non sense remarks. MOdi should take hard stance with RSS and tram and throw such people out of not only govt but party as well.

                            agree with the article totally , this govt has become a joke , no control over his ministers and Mr. Modi spoke about Mr. Manmohan's silence during his election campaign, this govt is doing totally opposite of what it has been voted for - they were voted for development and look at the ruckus they create on a daily basis, divide and rule is what they are practising , worse than the british empire.

                            Sadly but surely I have started to loose my trust in Modi. Once his strong supporter I am strating beleive what the opposition has been saying all along that his decision to keep quiet over misdemeanours of own team is likely to take India to abyss. I fear that by the time he is gone, the drift between Hindus and Muslims could be so wide that it will not be filled. Modi ji please take note of these illeterates that you have in your team because not only are they damaging your reputation but at worstthey are damaging the reputation of India. When we are working hard to make India proud you and your team members are doing nothing but spilling cold water on our efforts. If you cant help then please at least dont spoil our efforts.

                            This is how fascist speak. BJP is primarily corrupt and communal with highly thick headed people from RSS background who feel elated by showing themselves more pro-British, Pro-US rather than Pro-India. They neither represent Hindus which they claim nor Indian society as a whole.  Their best friends are sitting across border who came out from British two-nation theory which was applied to Indian soil to defeat Congress, defeat Mahatma Gandhi then in 1940's. This situation is prevailing today also. Current polity in India under BJP rule will be disastrous as we will become like our failed neighbours if they continue to remain in power &amp; kind of people at the helm of affairs who only know making mockery on institutions, know only character assassinations and actually hate democracy.

                            Apologies are clearly due to Nigeria. This type of vulgar language may be acceptable in the minister's private circle - but not anywhere else in the world. So the minister should be promptly sacked and asked to go home, where he can spend his time joking with his friends and saying whatever he wants to say. What a pathetic individual! I suppose he is one of those who looks up to people who have whiter skin than him. So he thinks everyone else is like that. Why is Modi not showing any courage? Is he afraid to sack this useless man?

One of the one hand Modi spends half his time running around all over the world on diplomatic trips. On the other hand, his partymen do things which make the country look like a laughing stock of the world - and he does nothing!!

                            Yes, Giriraj Singh is a racist. But so are most Indians. Remember all those ads for fair skinned brides? So what make Rajiv Gandhi so different? He was an Indian after all. The issue raised by Giriraj was pertinent, even if you hate to admit it. Admit it, in your heart of hearts you know that what he said was true. Yes politically not correct, but we are like that only. Racism is there everywhere. There is no country free from it. What we hated about what Giriraj said was that it held up a mirror to our own ugly face. Satyamave Jayate!

                            I believe Giriraj Singh spoke the truth, perhaps used words not as correctly as a seasoned journalist so used to the hustle and bustle of media correct language. Hey, Fair &amp; Lovely - what is that all about, pushed by no other than SRK. Look at any newspaper, all males are looking for fair complexion brides. Look at Bollywood - all go out of their way to pick "white" women. Ever seen a black woman being chased down by Bollywood. Of course not. So please do us a favour and stop being a holier than holy soul and smell the coffee, the reality of India. The fact is we are crude and do prefer fair skin over dark skin, for we believe fair equals beauty. And I do wonder if any Indian as high profile as Rajiv Gandhi would ever go out with a dark skinned woman?? Mind boggles....

                            Was so enthusiastic when Modi came to power. Now very disillusioned and believe it is better to have non-performing, corrupt government than these people. Unless Modi removes this man (can't call him gentleman) we should look forward to 2019 when this party will be thrown out, definitely, a must for the sake of India.

This article basically says "Dont expose the shortcomings of India"  it will spoil our image abroad, the same logic used by right wing to silence the documentary  "India's Daughter". <br/><br/><br/>
Giriraj Singh is not saying dark skinned people should not become political leaders he is asking whether dark skinned people get acceptance in India ? What is wrong in that ?

                            Can this man ever write on anything positive, especially of BJP. They were all holding back for a few months and now seizing on some silly issues/comments made by some elements, blowing them up and bringing in Modi on all issues. The agenda of the "secular" media anyway is well known.<br/>
Moreover, the fact that large number of Indians are racists to the extreme is well known by the way we treat the Africans in India, Also, well known is the way Indians generally  subjugate themselves to the Europeans and Americans. We need to be honest enough to accept this however crudely or brilliantly one puts it by his choice of words and be ashamed of this general attitude which is a complex mix of racism against Africans and our own NE and inferiority complex in our mindsets when it comes to the westerners.

I understand you have less work nowadays. But that doesn't mean you can pollute online space.<br/>
Not defending Giriraj Singh, but you can introspect some facts before you write.<br/><br/>
Even film actors use fairness cream becasue they ar enot confident on themselves!<br/>
And full size ads come in newspaper for these creams! Why is that. Because we Indians or some section of people prefer white color. Thats what Giriraj said. <br/>
I really think you should ask some one if you have difficulty in understandinf facts!!

                            A community that is split along Caste lines,should be Racist as well.The concept of the superiority of the Brahmin, for he was born from the head of Brahma,the lowly sudra from Brahma's feet, and the untouchable Dalit,has to have an impact on the thought process,many a times this finds expression in public and private.This divide in the community and concept of superiority drives many Indians to have a racial bent of mind.

                            We know these so called intellectuals and pseudo seculars. After West Bengal Rape incidence, they abused RSS &amp; VHP and Ghar Vappasi left and right. But after arrest of Bangladeshi national by police in the case, did not have courage to admit their faults. This is level of journalism in India.

                            Utter nonsense from Siddharth and most of the media as well. Giriraj is no more or no less racist than any Indian(northie, southie, fair, dark, medium dark etc).He is just pointed showed up(not intentionally maybe) of a stark truth of slavery to white skin? So his question is still valid...would Rajiv(or any other charming 'gore log' of India)married a african(read black), which poor Giriraj being a dehati could not articulate and misspoke as 'Nigerian' and even if one did would Indian masses have accepted her as a party leader and potential PM. The answer everybody knows is a big 'NO'. So all the nautanki is a sham played up media for 'time pass'.<br/><br/>

                            The comment was not made on Sonia but on Congress. If you think practically it is correct though not politically.<br/><br/>
Above all, it was a private conversation. It is unethical on the part of media to publicize it. <br/><br/>
Please tell honestly, do n't you pass such comments on your friends, leaders or on boss or any body.

                            All the time petty politicians, who are not so famous get fame by making either foolish comments or derogatory remarks, either on person, religion or sect. Unfortunately media give such people underserving attention. <br/><br/>
There are many good things that needs to be celebrated. <br/>
There are many issues that needs attention. <br/>
There are many unaccomplished tasks for which research is required.<br/>
...in all these endeavours media should play vital role.

                            ‘Slavery' still remains in minds of congressmen/women even after 68 years of Independence. It is the distorted mindset that makes think otherwise.

                            Respected Varadrajan ji, आप ने सही कहा क्या हासिल हुआ, लेकिन जो हुआ वह पूर्वनियोजित नहीं था। <br/>
इस तरह की भाषा का उपयोग कितने लोग सहज भाव से नहीं करते हैं। Media में जिस प्रकार से इसे प्रस्तुत किया जा रहा है, उससे कोई सकारात्मक परिवर्तन नहीं लाया जा सकता है। पुरे विश्व में शिक्षित अशिक्षित सभी रंगभेद की मानसिकता से प्रभावित है । सामाजिक बदलाव आज की Media के बस का नहीं है। हाल में इनके द्वारा एक प्रयोग/प्रयास किया गया ... राजनितिक परिवर्तन का ....प्रबुद्ध वर्ग ने एतिहासिक समर्थन दिया ....नतीजा देखना बाकी है।<br/>
😄 To cut the long story short सामाजिक बदलाव के लिए क्रांति जरुरी है। डार्विन के शब्दों में Mutation is required,  evolutionary change process is very slow and may take million of years.😄

                            Yes, it was not a remark for an Union minister. But the attention the remark is getting is pure politics. Mr. Varadarajan, if you didn't hate the BJP so much, you wouldn't have written this article. Did you write one when the AAP picked on African women? BTW, that incident likely did more damage. It is most unfortunate that the press is picking on fringes instead of talking about developmental issues. But that doesn't sell does it? I guess you are inwardly thanking Giriraj Singh.

                            Why should Giriraj Singh's comments do any damage? In fact, his statements could help India by highlighting the racism in the Indian society. What he says has some truth in it. By changing our attitudes towards the Africans we can develop better relations with them. When there was a coup in Fiji, it was because Rambuka being dark was treated very badly in India.
