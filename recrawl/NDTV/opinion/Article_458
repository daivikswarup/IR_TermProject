Headline::::AAP as a Target of Stings



DateTime::::2015-03-17T17:42:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	Sting operations as a potent tool for investigative journalism are in vogue once again for the last few days but not for good reasons. The last week has seen many so-called sting operations that created a stir in political corridors and each one rubbed AAP the wrong way. The funny part is that none of these was carried out by a journalist. It was carried out by political actors who were/are part of the political slugfest.
	Two of the operations were done by the volunteers of AAP itself. It was a serious attempt to inflict a fatal blow to Arvind Kejriwal's public persona. One sting tried to portray Arvind as someone who wanted to break the Congress party and form the government by wrong means. The other was to showcase him as anti-Muslim. Both the stings were mischievous and were largely misinterpreted to project Arvind being no different than other politicians; painting him with the same brush as others.
	The third sting never saw the light of the day. In fact it was a classic case of media manipulation in an era of competitive TV journalism. Congress leader Asif Khan made a sensational allegation that he had an audio recording with senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh in which he was seen to be making some deals with him for government formation. All the TV channels scrambled to get him on air without bothering to review the so-called audio tape. He was on all the channels but none had his audio tape. It was a curious case of irresponsible journalism.
	This entire situation raised certain fundamental questions about the ethics of journalism. I had run a TV channel as an editor for eight years and never run any information whose ownership was not proved. We are trained as interns to verify information at least from two sources before airing or making any information public. That is the fundamental rule. But here the first tape whose ownership was not clear was run by all the channels. The man in question, Rajesh Garg, who is supposed to have recorded the conversation with Arvind, refused to own up to the fact that he had leaked the tape. This puts the onus on the broadcasters to verify the authenticity of the tape. Every channel ran that audio tape without verifying the authenticity. Nobody bothered to examine if the tape was manipulated, doctored or edited to suit a particular purpose. No channel went to any forensic lab to check if the voice recoded was genuine and belonged to the person they claimed it did.
	This was rather startling as the Supreme Court guidelines are very clear. No audio tape purporting to have voices of two individuals can be aired if the recording was not authorised by a designated senior official of the Home Ministry or police official. Secondly, it can only be done if there is public interest and, finally, the authenticity of the tape is proved beyond doubt. Here was a curious case. Broadcasters were openly saying that they could not vouch for the authenticity of the tape but they were having a vociferous debate about the content of the tape and were making all kinds of allegations against AAP.
	I remember that when I was an editor, a consensus was developed among all the promoters and editors that unless the authenticity of the tape was proved, it should not go public. The same logic was applied to many cases especially when the "snoop gate" tapes surfaced. Many channels refused to air the recorded voices as the tapes were not authenticated. But the same rule was not applied this time and serious allegations of political horse-trading and practicing communal politics were levelled against Arvind and AAP.
	The case of third non-existent tape was more perplexing. For a good two days, Asif Khan claimed that he had an audio clip which would prove that Sanjay Singh was doing a deal with him to form the government in Delhi with the support of Congress MLAs. This story ran for two full days. It was also said that Asif would produce the tape either that evening or sometime the next day, but that never happened. On the third day, when he was confronted, he just showed a pen drive claiming it might have a few clips. He refused to share that also. I am still waiting for that non-existent audio tape to surface. It was a clear case of media being manipulated. The media ran a story based on his claims without verifying if he had a tape or not. Sanjay Singh was traumatised. He vehemently denied it all and said if such tapes surfaced, he would leave politics. His version was not taken seriously. Asif's words were taken as gospel truth.
	As a former editor, who has spent considerable time in media and one with a certain reputation, I can say that media crossed its Lakhshman Rekha in its zeal to compete with others. It was irresponsible journalism. I would have forgotten and forgiven if the error had been committed by cub reporters but if celebrity anchors and top TV editors start asking questions based on the content of the tape without being sure of the veracity, then it raises certain questions. Why should I not believe that it was done with a purpose and intention to malign the image of the party and its leader, Arvind? I refused to believe that these senior editors had no knowledge of the Supreme Court (SC) guidelines and also of the NBSA which clearly spell out in what circumstances an audio or video tape can be aired.
	When I asked one of the most high-profile anchors of an English Channel  why 'snoopgate' and 'bank scam' tapes were not run, I was told that it was the editor's right to choose which story he/she wanted to run. Agreed, but is it justified to run a tape without verifying the authenticity of the sting and reaching conclusions on the basis of claims whose veracity is not proved? Can I ask the question that if a tape of a similar nature had surfaced involving Mr. Modi or senior cabinet minister of the BJP, would the media have behaved the same way? The 'Snoopgate' case suggests it would not have.
	It is this aspect which forces me to conclude that AAP and Arvind Kejriwal are a soft target, a punching bag for the media. Or, despite having a tremendous respect for press, should I believe that there is an attempt in a section of the media to act at the prompting of others whose identity I don't want to talk about now but who don't want AAP to grow in stature? Either way it does not add stature to the media which is perceived to be the watchdog of Indian democracy and considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I must say that the aap members have got some good skills in the area of wasting people's time. wake up Indians, stop wasting time on aap and its members. You have got more important things to do rather than discussing aap all the time.

                            You reap what you sow. As a new party, you (AK) used same media to make all such sting operations public and garner enough mileage. So, what's your problem now? If your legal standing is sound, why don't you claim damages in court against all these channels? Irony is you need same media platform to air your current views.

                            Talk of the devil quoting the scriptures! This sleazy, conceited, agenda driven guy thinks people have forgotten how he and Prasun Bajpai, among others, used their channels as a platform to build Brand Arvind. He now has the gall to fling the "irresponsible journalism" charge at all &amp; sundry. And, pray tell, why are only journalists "authorized" to conduct sting ops when your own Fuehrer told Dilliwalas to record bribe seekers on their mobiles and pass it on? This man along with that Khaitan bloke will bury AAP so deep that even divine intervention cannot resurrect it!

                            Mr. Ashutosh- there is a word called 'intellectual integrity' you must try to introspect on that. I have read about many slaves of Mrs Indira Gandhi but you beat them all hands down. To the benefit and long term survival - AAP needs to curtail one man worship. Else we have the real danger of converting this into another political party - which it is already thanks to minds like yours

                            Come on, ashutosh. When an audio clip of Indian Express correspondent was purported to be used against YY as an evidence of working against the party, did you, as votary of authenticity of the clip, argue that the clip should not be used till its veracity is established. Why , then lecture on legality or morality of airing the clip..Selective justice is injustice and hypocrisy..remember that. Your group threatened (yes threatened..) to make some other stings of YY public..without checking its authenticity... I hope you have got what it is about..Hypocrisy, Lies and Dishonesty..

I am convinced now that AAP is nothing but a bunch of hypocrites getting together and making a fool of the people. Delhi voters have you now realised your blunder?

Think the viewers these days have seen enough of stings to differentiate between the fake and genuine. Despite the damaging contents of the Rajesh Garg sting, Arvind Kejriwal is still to say anything about it. Is AAP going to have it investigated?

                            Sadly Asuthosh I have to agree with you on this. celebrity anchors and top TV editors in India don't do anymore content, knowledge based and investigative journalism anymore, they are more about creating sensationalism for the day. The same sad story is across United States and Europe. Democratic process is messy at best but we the people are creating noise and confusion...which has become a new norm. And media is only helping to inflame the situation, where as most have become basically GANGLAND DEMOCRACIES.

                            It will be a big mistake if stalwarts of AAP think that Delhi 2015 victory was a result of any strategic moves of the leaders. It was a result of volunteers' efforts and contacts with the voters and the unconditional support of Delhi voters. The near clean sweep has a basis in the expectations of voters and the promises given by party leaders.So, if the coterie of Ashutosh, Khaitan, Sisodia, or Kumar Vishwas think they can highjack the party with their agenda they are mistaken. Public will not allow them any audience. They will be kicked in their asses if they think they can throw any body out of the party. Yadav and Bhushan are among the founders of AAP and have brought value to the ethics of the party.All voters and the volunteers believe it and will not spare anyone who brings cracks in the party. Now there is only one agenda for the party. Pay maximum attention to the governance and find out ways of fulfilling the promises. Otherwise public will never spare you. They will kick you if you falter anywhere. BEWARE.

                            Actually, the volunteers should throw Ashutosh and Khaitan out of the party for bringing disrepute to the Aam Aadmi Party. They are the biggest culprits. To cover up their own sins they are trying to make scapegoats of Yadavji And Bhushanji on false charges. Kejriwal himself is allowing them to take centre stage. This is his biggest mistake. God save his party.

You are being paid back in the same coin as you tomtommed. It is really nice to see that you dont like being stinged just like others also.<br/><br/>
You did not leave your own people (read Y. Yadav ) from your machinations. Please learn chickens mostly come home to roost, sometimes sooner sometimes in distant future.<br/><br/>
We are sure to see such things much more often.

                            Ashutosh is the definition of a person having double standards. He finds faults with every activity of people from other parties, but the same activity becomes noble and correct when done by any AAP member. Till stings were carried out against parties other than AAP, Ashutosh was very chuffed and said that these kind of things should be brought out into the public domain, but when AAP is the target for a sting operation then it is dirty politics and foul play.

                            "AAP as a Target of Stings"  Ashuthosh.....I simply do not know what to comment about you. All words in the English dictionary have been exhausted by the people in these columns. I hope you are literate enough to read those and importantly understand the meaning of those words. As far as "stings" go, and some of them pointing directly at your "Atrociously Amalgamated/Anarchist Party, the AAP," all I can say is that your own sting has come back to haunt you. In other words, you people of the AAP have laid on your back and have spat in the air, the spit coming down hard and sure on your own faces. So it is high time you and your party leaders and workers and volunteers realise that you need to behave properly wherever you go....You can do anything you want in the confines of your bedrooms, but do not show your vulgar mindset in public. However, the vulgarity also includes arrogance on your part and that of Ashish Khetan too, just to name a few....

                            Because Ashuthosh could not give a satisfactory answer to his employers as to why he was giving so much undue coverage to the AAP, his employers threw him out. No other media house was ready to employ him. The easiest employment without educational qualification, experience, honesty, or even commitment to work was the Aam Aadmi Party. So he found easy entry into AAP. Ashuthosh, as mentioned by some of his former colleagues on national television debates, started playing politics between AK-49 and the co-founders of AAP and created a rift among th top members and founders of the AAP. Somehow he "buttered" AK-49, was his "yes" man, and then has found himself to be the spokesperson of the AAP, singing virtues of the party and then badmouthing other parties. If a person like rahul gandhi and with his party credentials, money power, strong force of ground-level workers, loyalists, lawyers, etc., is finding it difficult to survive in politics, what can be said about Ashuthosh and his AAP? The people of Delhi made a fatal mistake and have to live with it for another nearly 5 years. Alas! The people of Delhi have to wash away their sins on their own. Meanwhile, the aam aadmi cheap minister will go to holiday resorts and spas across the country just to find a remedy for his cough.....just when the people across the country find it difficult to locate a doctor to treat suspected swine flu or viral fever. Is going to a holiday resort to be treated the remedy for a "simple cough?" .....Aam Aadmi Party they call it! How blasphemous!

                            All the parties were good at corrupting, AAP is good at making Aam Aadmi corrupt and also they will loot only from common man.....BJP and Congress are Value based, but AAP is volume based, otherwise very party is corrupt

                            Everyone knows that most media houses are either owned or controlled indirectly through sponsorship or advertisements by big corporate companies. They work like any business undertaking for maximum profits and not for establishing the truth.

                            Ashutosh, all this is fine. You cannot have different standards for different people. Think the viewers these days have seen enough of stings to differentiate between the fake and genuine. Despite the damaging contents of the Rajesh Garg sting, Arvind Kejriwal is still to say anything about it. Is AAP going to have it investigated?
