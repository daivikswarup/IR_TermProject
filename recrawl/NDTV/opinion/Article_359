Headline::::The BJP's Kiran Bedi Project



DateTime::::2015-01-20T14:11:00+05:30



(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi)Without warning, just like that, the Delhi assembly election has become a fascinating contest and a high-risk game for all three parties in the fray, the BJP, the Aam Aadmi party (AAP) and the Congress. How has this happened? Let us look at it party by party.By bringing in Kiran Bedi as the face of the BJP campaign and candidate for chief minister, party president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have raised the stakes significantly. Bedi's reputation as India's first female IPS officer is well-known, as is her activism while in service as well as during the India against Corruption phase in 2011. Nevertheless, she is not an organisational insider in a party where patience is seen as a primary virtue. She is a lateral entrant and obviously the traditional BJP leadership in Delhi would feel slighted and threatened by her sudden ascendancy. Yet, Shah and Modi are betting on Delhi's demography and civic sensibilities having evolved beyond old-style political loyalties. This explained why the children and grandchildren of Jana Sangh founder members voted for Sheila Dikshit(Congress) in 2003 and 2008. This explained the surge in support for AAP in 2013. The BJP is seeking to incorporate this "non-political" or "extra-political" sentiment by projecting Bedi. If the venture succeeds, it could herald a new dynamic within the party. On the other hand, if The Bedi Project falters, the BJP will be in some trouble. It would have superseded a generation of local leaders without being able to appropriately fill the resultant vacuum.For Arvind Kejriwal and AAP, Delhi 2015 represents a desperate battle. It is unlikely AAP will win a majority; even Kejriwal adherents don't go that far in their optimism. At best, AAP can hope for a near repeat of the December 2013 verdict and a hung assembly that gives Kejriwal and his colleagues a veto in terms of government formation. Should this happen, the party will then use its auxiliaries in the media and in the "civil society" networks to pressure the Congress into backing it.What if the unexpected happens and AAP slips from its 28-seat performance of the previous winter? In that situation, the desertions of recent weeks - with a series of second-level AAP functionaries joining the BJP - will intensify. AAP's future and the sustainability of a political career for its motley crew of journalists, social scientists, mohalla roughnecks and retired income-tax officers will come into serious question. In some senses, the Kejriwal bubble would burst at that point and a more normal politics would return to Delhi.In the Congress, the risk-taking is being done by Ajay Maken and his group in the Delhi unit. This follows a period of intense internal debate in the party. The Dikshit camp is absent from this campaign, as is the central leadership of the Congress. Both the proverbial "high command" of the party and the faction centred on the former Chief Minister have appeared quite content to play second fiddle to Kejriwal in the interests of some fraudulent notion of "secular unity". Maken showed more of a streetfighter instinct. He has taken on AAP, reckoning quite correctly that it is the chief competitor for what remains of the Congress vote.Maken has encouraged Congress big guns in Delhi, including former MPs, to go back to their constituencies and enter the assembly contest. The Congress isn't in the race to lead a government and will probably finish third - but there is a huge difference between aiming for under half-a-dozen seats and being in serious contention in about a dozen. In going for broke, Maken is hoping to interrupt the neat BJP-AAP bipolarity that was developing. He is giving his party, and himself, a chance to fight another day, in 2020 or whenever. A poor third place for the second successive election would leave the Congress in very dire straits.In previous elections in Delhi, the presence of a third force - the BSP or Muslim independents competing in minority-dominated constituencies - had hurt the Congress and divided its vote. This time, the BJP will be praying that the Congress can cut into the AAP vote and play spoiler.As for the Dalit segment, the BJP has made a very determined attempt to wrest it, calculating that the absence of the BSP and weakness in the Congress give it an opening. Of course, Kejriwal is making very much the same assumption.All in all, with two weeks to go, the seat of India's capital is left with three competing gambles and three competing gamblers. February 10, the day the votes will be counted, may as well be Derby Day in Delhi.Â Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Surprised at your tone - "motley crew of journalists, social scientists, mohalla roughnecks and retired income-tax officers will come into serious question". You seem to be fine with the credentials of some politicians like scamsters / gangsters / killers but not with a 'motley crew' who atleast have good intentions!

                            If AAP loses then Arvind will be hopefully the Leader of Opposition and he can tour all over the country to establish AAP.  Whoever has to leave AAP (except one) has already left AAP. The remaining will be there till they take AAP to a truly national level.  AAP will become a major force to challenge BJP across the nation in 2019, given the decimation of Congress. If AAP wins, then Arvind has to prove himself as CM of Delhi. In fact 2019 will become tough for AAP, if Arvind becomes CM, given the hostile media.

                            By bringing Kiran bedi..BJP conceded defeat before the fight began. If she loses, it is Kiran bedi's defeat..not Modi....Everywhere else, all the past victories credit was given to Feku, this would have been the first biting defeat to feku..by bringing Kiran bedi..feku is shielded from the worst defeat..the 65yr old senile...played into the hands of BJP..

                            Delhi Elections were normal, when there was no AAP. Since AAP came delhi elections became special. Some people believe that AK betrayed Delhi people by resigning...If ruling delhi for 49 days and achieving atleast something including doing dharnas is called as ANARCHY, THEN I guess for 7 months fooling people with fake promise of bringing black money back, spilling poison by psychopaths bjp mp sachi maharaj, yogi adityanath, niranjan sadhvi etc, not mentioning the donations received on their websites, not coming under RTI also, spilling poison - india is a nation of hindus, Justifying sickminded campaign Gharwapsi, etc actually the list is endless is nothing but ANARCHY+HYPOCRACY+DIVIDIVE POLITICS+PROPAGANDA+.....INFINITE.<br/>
Ab ki baar Kejriwal...woh bhi poore 5 saal.

                            Congress is no where in the race, it may well fall from its last tally, BJP has gambled, confused its own rank &amp; file, its counter effets will be dramitical, not just in delhi but else where, in all APP has to gain.

                            There is no doubt that Kijriwal will finally become the CM again. The only difference will be that they will come up with full majority. Kiran Bedi may work as an MLA and give AAP good suggestions in Policing. This will be a good combination. We will then be able to see how good she is in understanding of ELECTRICITY, WATER and 100s of different issues. She is absolutely wrong to say that one can have the best governance only when CENTER AND STATE both have the same party in governance. That means MODI will not help Delhi to get better if AAP will come into majority in Delhi. That's NEGATIVE politics. We all know that AAP has the right attitude to govern and they are quick in performing themselves as well. Then why will MODI pull his hands off supporting a righteous cause in Delhi. Delhi can be a PROFIT center instead of a COST CENTER, provided you try to me it a Profit center.

                            In 2015 AK will become the CM of Delhi. In 2019 he will become the PM of India. In 2024 he will become the President of United States. In 2029 he will become the ruler of the world. in 2034 he will move the earth from its current orbit to a star in Andromeda galaxy. In 2039 he will create a parallel universe and call it AKBROOM. <br/><br/>
in the Delhi elections he will win all the 70 seats. All the BJP and Congress candidates will lose their deposits. Modi will make the Delhi Police and Army to report to AK. Women can roam around freely in Delhi even after midnight. They will only fear Somnath Bharti. <br/><br/>
BTW, where is Mr.Bhushan?

                            Kejeri is a natural breeze for the Delhi people but Kiren Bedi is a wind created artificially. Kejeri will be the winner and Bedi will be the looser  but in either case we the people will be the actual looser and will be forever in this country.

                            without getting into the nitty-grity of the politics in Delhi, i believe that induction of Ms.Krian Bedi will shake up the rather stolid, conservative and rather orthodox think-system of the BJP/RSS political setup.

                            Your sentiments are fully conveyed by using the word Project in your title because the whole arrangement is getting a dimension of business. Do we call this a clean business? Where are the morals and ethics of the beneficiaries who had been projecting BJP differently? Is this the quality of leadership that we should accept? Aren't they just opportunist?

                            Kiran bedi has deserted her posts several times without notice. She was always mole of BJP, even during service. She was almost a perfect spy, working against Indian government. If anybody thinks treachery is Ok can vote for her. Otherwise vote for honest party AAP,  who values honesty, sincerety, anticorruption, pro common-people policies.
