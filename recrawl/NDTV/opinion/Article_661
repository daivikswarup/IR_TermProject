Headline::::Has Vasundhara Been Used to Take the Heat Off Swaraj?



DateTime::::2015-06-19T18:17:00+05:30




                                "I do not say that the political leadership is not mature. But because of the shortcomings, I don't have the confidence that it cannot happen again. I do not see any sign in our polity that assures me of any outstanding aspects of leadership. A commitment to democracy and to all other aspects related to democracy is lacking."
This is the assessment offered by BJP veteran LK Advani to The Indian Express in an interview on the 40th anniversary of the Emergency.
For those who have read the interview, it is not very difficult to infer that the remarks are an indirect indictment of the Modi government,  and similar to the sentiments expressed recently by another senior leader Arun Shourie.
The scathing comment by BJP patriarch Advani comes at a time when his protege Sushma Swaraj is embroiled in a damaging controversy vis-a-vis her relationship with corruption-tainted cricket honcho Lalit Modi.
In an earlier ndtv.com column this week, this author had written about apprehensions expressed by the Sushma Swaraj camp that the troika of Narendra Modi, Arun Jaitley and Amit Shah could have played a role in facilitating the media leak of the story which took the country by storm this Sunday.
Sushma had expressed her apprehension to the RSS about this being a conspiracy to further stifle her voice in the party and silence her rebellion over PM Modi shadow-running her ministry, leaving her with very little to do as Foreign Minister. In fact, those in the Sushma camp have told this reporter that she  very recently complained to LK Advani and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat that the Modi cabinet is running on the lines of the Gujarat Model, where Modi remote-controlled every ministry.
It can be safely assumed that Advani's interview was an attempt to come out in support of his protege who he suspected was being made a scapegoat in a conyroversy which involved other BJP who have been a part of administrating  cricket in India.
Another twist in "Lalitgate" came mid-week with the revelation by Lalit Modi that  Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje , friend-turned-foe, had supported his request for UK citizenship. It is being widely speculated that this claim was orchestrated to deflect attention from Sushma Swaraj whose more -than-amiable relationship with Lalit Modi has landed her in trouble.
Vasundhara Raje  has been increasingly in the line of fire of the RSS which, according to sources, disapproves of her style of governance and arguably lavish lifestyle.  She has found herself a lone ranger in  this battle with the document furnished by her for Lalit Modi and his financial assistance to a company owned  by her son now squatting centrestage.
Most BJP leaders have been warned against defending Vasundhara Raje. Reports also emerged that party president Amit Shah had refused to grant her a meeting in Delhi (her office said this is not true).
While the charges against Vasundhara are very serious and potentially jeopardize her career , it is more than obvious that she has become collateral damage in the war between the two factions in the BJP.
The Congress plans to stall the functioning of the monsoon session of parliament by seeking the resignations of Sushma and Vasundhara. The way things stand today in the BJP, and  according to the reported directives of the RSS , Sushma Swaraj stands safe. Which means that if there was an attempt to oust her by her rivals, the move has clearly backfired.
In the year March 2011, when Sushma Swaraj was the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, she hit out at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the cash-for-vote scam using a powerful Urdu couplet "Tu idhar udhar ki na baat kar, ye bata ki kaafila kyun luta. Hamein rahjanon se gila nahi teri rehbari ka sawaal hai " (do not talk about this and that, tell us why the caravan was looted; we have no complaint with the passers-by, it is a question of your leadership).
Little did Sushma realise that the couplet would come back to haunt her and her PM just years later. Perhaps this is what they call poetic justice.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which will be published later this year.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Those like this columnist, have waited impatiently for some controversy like that of Swaraj's to come by so they can vomit their hatred for the BJP and offcourse, Mr. Narendra Modi. I have often wondered why she hates Modi so much? Is it because his election makes the Friday prayers seem getting futile? Why do Muslim intellectuals find it so hard to respect Modi and the popular mandate of the country? Swaraj will be judged by the people who voted for her and her party and leader. Right now we want him to continue his good work. Swaraj's exceptional track record and her conduct compel us to respect her explanation and move on. To extrapolate Mr. Advani's words to badger Modi is in bad taste.

                            L K Advani is a very senior BJP leader. He has criticised the Emergency and raised apprehensions that it may take place again. To twist that to imply that he is referring to Modi is a cheap shot. But what else would you expect of Ayyub? In all her numerous columns she has never found anything good to say about Modi or the BJP. Perhaps her background explains her prejudices.<br/>
What Ayyub should have concentrated on was the ghastly Emergency itself. Imposed by Indira Gandhi and controlled by Sanjay Gandhi. Yes, the grandmother and uncle of her pet Rahul Gandhi. And if the Emergency is ever imposed again, is it not far more likely that the Congress will do it, rather than the BJP? After all, they have done it before. All the BJP stalwarts were in jail during the Emergency, including the very same Advani. <br/>
Ayyub should have recollected the suspension of all rights, including the right to life and habeas corpus. The President who was an 'angoota chaap'. The supine Supreme Court. The demolition of poor peoples homes and forced sterilisation camps. The curbs on media and free speech. The massive corruption scams, and the corrupt electoral practices of Indira Gandhi that led to her election being struck down, and in turn her desperation at losing power that led to the Emergency. The DARKEST HOUR of Indian Democracy. And true Indians, including the BJP and Modi, will make sure that it does not recur.<br/>
Let Ayyub write about all that and we will acknowledge her to be a journalist. Otherwise she is only a Congress cheer leader waving her pom poms. With a very plain personal agenda to boot.

                            Come'on lady.....give us a break. Do you really have to pounce upon any damn chance to criticize BJP govt ? Do you consider yourself a responsible journalists by writing such biased columns? Please for God sake it's nothing more than SOUR GRAPES for our respected senior statesman, who has long crossed his retirement age. Please just leave him alone &amp; let the guys work for 5 years at least.

                            I strongly object to word used by author as "her PM', this is purely partisan mindset the same language being used by Rahul Gandhi and his cronies. PM is the PM elected for country and not for selective individuals.

                            Sushma's Ballari connections seem to have been not probed as well as it should have been . She had repeatedly told that Reddy brothers and Sriramulu were like her children. Why the children have ignored their mother is not at all inscrutable as the mother had also let down when the children were in ( are still in unless this government wants to dilute the cases) deep difficulties owing their own shenanigans

                            It is Arun Jaitley that should be sacked. Kirti Azad has been seeking transparency in DDCA but jaitley has been blocking it. And he is fine with all the murky deals that happen in the BCCI.<br/><br/>
Jaitley is a cunning fox.

                            So called journalists with a set agenda in mind can bring in any analogy to prove their point. Irrelevance they hardy bother. They fail to understand the pulse of the nation &amp; keep singing praise for their masters who are no where. If people had faith in the foolish notion of sickularism, Congress party would not been at 44 today &amp; BJP from 2 to 282. Such journalists ensure that communal agenda prospers by creating a scare minority syndrome.
