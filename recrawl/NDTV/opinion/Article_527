Headline::::What a Farmer Named Gajendra Singh Has Exposed



DateTime::::2015-04-27T20:24:00+05:30




                                The Gajendra Singh misadventure at the AAP rally might have been a deliberate suicide or a publicity stunt gone wrong. We will have to wait till the Delhi Police enquiry and/or the judicial enquiry ordered by the Delhi government come to the end of their labours.
 
What is more germane is that a relatively well-off farmer from a relatively progressive agricultural district like Dausa should have been forced to take such dramatic action to bring to all concerned the woes of the farming community. This column has already drawn attention insistently to the haunting fact that while the economy grew at nearly 7.5 per cent last fiscal, "agriculture and allied activities" (that is, dairying, fisheries, social forestry and similar rural economic activity) grew by a miserable 1.1 per cent. While economists, in general, and partisan politicians, in particular, cannot stop cheering the lip-smacking achievement of India, in GDP terms, having become the fastest-growing large economy in the world, and better still, overtaking China, behind this statisticians' dream is the nightmare reality that close on two-thirds of our people are living in conditions of desperation. No wonder on the Gross Domestic Happiness scale, India falls behind terrorist-ridden Pakistan and instability-ridden Bangladesh. And on the UN's Human Development Index, India stagnates around position 135 notwithstanding all the economic growth that has taken place since neo-liberalism became fashionable.
The relentless influx into the cities is proof of the terrible truth that our grim urban slums are better than our despairing villages. Not only have we failed the Gandhian injunction "to wipe every tear from every eye", we seem assiduously to be working the pump on the tear ducts of the bulk of our population.
 
Tempted as I am to mock Narendra Modi's achche din, I refrain from doing so because the present is only a sad continuation of a long and disappointing past. Where Nehru soon after Independence had said, "Everything else can wait, but not agriculture", the current syndrome was summed up for me by one of our most distinguished Finance Ministers (and I don't mean Arun Jaitley - he is hardly distinguished) responding to a question on agriculture at a public meeting saying, "We have 130 million agricultural families in our country and only 140 million hectares of arable land. What do you expect me to do?"
At the heart of the neo-liberal agenda for the economic transformation of India lies the proposition that agriculture is a hopeless dead-end and that the answer lies in unbridled urbanization and industrialization. These goals are to be secured by making land cheap relative to the costs of capital and, to the extent possible, keeping labour costs low compared to capital expenditure. The question of cheap land is sought to be addressed by the forcible acquisition of land from farmers to hand over to infrastructure and industry at throw-away prices. And by propagating the view that it is in the interest of the unemployed themselves to secure employment by keeping labour cheap. Hence, it is argued, the desirability of maintaining a large army of the unemployed to hold down wages and thus make it attractive for capital to employ labour. The logic of this argument may be summed up as follows: keep large numbers unemployed in order to increase employment! And it follows that if wages start rising, it is in the interest of development for capital to be encouraged to import hi-technology from abroad to reduce the ratio of labour employed for every unit of capital invested. Wah! wah!
This is called "technological upgrading" and urged on the grounds of "improving competition". The consequence is a huge amount of labour retrenchment.
 
This is covered up by the theoretical claim that such and such increment in investment leads to so much growth in employment. If, however, we still have "jobless growth" that is because net employment generation (additional employment minus redundancy) is never cited (and unemployment caused by land acquisition is ignored); only gross employment figures are thrown around to create the illusion that higher industrial growth means higher employment. Hence the bewilderment on the part of the poor Indian as to why we seem to be enjoying boundless growth but suffering joblessness!
 
The other ploy is to let flow a stream of data to demonstrate that few, if any, want to remain in agriculture. This, of course, is to ask the wrong question. Why would anyone want to stay in agriculture if it is so un-remunerative? The right question is: can we make agriculture remunerative? Of course we can; of course, we should. Where the share of agriculture in GDP has dropped from about half at Independence to a mere 13 per cent now, the share of our population principally deriving their livelihood from agriculture is over half. If, as we should, we add those who partly survive on agriculture, that figure goes up to over 60 per cent. Is it just that nearly two-thirds of our people should live on just over one-tenth of our national income?
 
To make agriculture remunerative, we need to free the market for agricultural produce. We do not, because our urban middle class does not wish to pay a fair price. By controlling that market, successive governments have kept their urban constituents content. They have tried to make up for this by guaranteeing minimum support prices to some agricultural products, mainly foodgrains. But MSP usually lags behind the rise in input prices (and have largely been frozen in the Modi dispensation). So the burden increases disproportionately on those who can least protest - the scattered ranks of the small and marginal farmer. He is also the most affected victim of natural calamity - the failure of rains; unseasonal downpours; hail; floods; drought - and all the other uncertainties to which the most important segment of our economy is heir, and in a political system that responds quickly to urban woes but is almost unaware, and even when it is aware, barely listens to the rural voice.
 
That is until some Gajendra Singh ties a rope around his neck at a public rally. Suddenly, the issue becomes - for a while - the flavour of the moment. For the best part of a week, the Rajya Sabha has virtually stopped all other business to discuss agriculture. The media throngs exiting MPs to give their bytes to show their concern. Soon enough, we will return to type and agriculture will revert to being the last item on the neo-liberal agenda of priorities. And Gajendra Singh - reduced from an individual to a symbol - will pass into history. Alas!

                            Ofcourse we can make agriculture remunerative!! But not when you are in power because you want to run scams. When you are in opposition, you blabber and do bashan and blame Modi. Our DISTINGUISHED Finance Minister Mr Arun Jaitley has done which very few, very very few earlier ministers have done MMI. As always, crappy opinions :)

                            I have a better idea you communist dolt. If you can't make it in farming how about you change your profession? Modi may be responsible for last year but you are responsible for the first 65. Speaking of communism and blood shed what do you think about your ideological mentors Stalin and Mao killing a combined 90 million?

                            I don't think the issue with farmer suicides has anything to do with MSP. What farmers get killed by is a lack of formal financial institution in times of crisis ( such as bad monsoons this year). We need a two fold strategy- 1) Improve the financial institutions and 2) Improve irrigation and other farming technologies. <br/>
Obviously both of these measures can't be done in an year and to blame current govt. is foolish and political opportunism at its best.

                            MANI , needs to "study" a little more , every developed nation has had  to under go this transition from a purely agricultural to a mix of agriculture and industry . The real problem is how do you strike a balance between the two .Every country in history has faced this problem , and we Indians have to find a solution that suits us because no two countries are equal .The current land bill needs to be implemented if this country needs to develop its infrastructure .For every canal, every road , hospital ,railways,defense project common denominator is Land .With out infrastructure there is no way india will be able to support the hungry stomachs of 1.5 billion indians and more in coming decades

                            We all know the motive behind such useless and biased articles of this die-hard sycophant. Those who support him and challenge MSA's critics to tackle his blabbering with facts, here are few, which MSA has shamelessly lied on:  UNDP has published Human Development Index only till 2013 and as per that India is ranked 135.  Also if you see UNDP's last 33 years Human Development Index trend, India has been tottering at the bottom consistently and specifically from 2005-2013, it never showed any growth improvement.  Will MSA admit that it is his party responsible for such pathetic performance?  Secondly, yes, India ranks 111th Rank much below Bangadesh (108) and Pakistan (81)in Human Happiness Index but this was in 2010-12.  Why is he attributing all the sins and misdeeds of UPA to BJP led NDA now?  Will he or his supporters explain why is he talking about all these data now which pertained to UPA regime?  By the way, the low growth of agriculture &amp; allied sectors cannot be attributed to just last 1 year but for decades of Congress rule.  Please take note that the present Govt. has completed 1 Financial Year and the results are not yet out.  Let MSA keep his bloody mouth shut rather than generate crap like this.

                            Somebody please tell Mr Ayyer that we are in 2015, not in nehruvian era or Rajiv Gandhi era. He seems to be stuck at that age .. Poor guy, don't remember that the influx to the cities did happen at Congress era due to neglect of that industry in terms of modernization. Blaming should be done to congress but not the present govt.

                            While there's no escaping the fact that almost 7 decades post independence, India track record in modernising agriculture and living up to the 'jai kisaan' piece of the slogan is reprehensible, theres no escaping the following facts too -<br/><br/>
A. The plight of farmers is not an overnight development. It's been bad under decades of your effective inclusive leadership. We thank you and your bosses for that.<br/><br/>
B. "The right question is: can we make agriculture remunerative? Of course we can; of course, we should." So did you? Maybe you did, it was lost on the rest of the country however.<br/><br/>
C. "To make agriculture remunerative, we need to free the market for agricultural produce. We do not, because our urban middle class does not wish to pay a fair price." - Promise your readers that if such a step is taken, you wont implicate the BJP government for inflation. Promise us the same self control that you exercised today by not mocking "acche din".<br/><br/>
D. "He is also the most affected victim of natural calamity - the failure of rains;" - Remind us all once again, who backed the Narmada valley project and who opposed it? <br/><br/>
E. You start off with a caveat, the responsible columnist that you are,  saying you'd like to wait for the delhi police to determine if the farmer who was lost, was driven by economic desperation or was a victim of a stunt gone wrong, before you start off with your weekly modi bashing, yet from then on, you've just to play judge, jury and executioner and have implied that everything wrong in the world is because we threw you off your high pedestal in delhi.<br/><br/>
The only politicians in India, who work harder than the PM, are the PM's constant critics.

                            For the first time I agree with Mr. MSA. He maybe right in suggesting that industrialisation may not be the solution to industries and I totally support that. Being from a farmer family, I have seen the pain of a farmer. But I'd like to ask you about the same statistics, 50% to 13% agricultural share in country's GDP, but under whose rule? Why unemployment % increased during congress rule, and for worse, why farmers never got their fair value under best economists.. Wrecked food supply chain, canals and river interlinkings, pension and better focus on seeds and green/white revolution 2.0 maybe future works, apart from Controlled industrialisation.. Modi so far seemsvery linear towards industries and ignoring other factors! Second point maybe towards a better licensing of small and medium enterprising identifying their contribution to rural and stranded far places. Hope Modi doesn't focus on just industries which can increase the value of money and zero saving model which forces workers into viscous circle of work force

The aim is to keep the Hindus of this country weak, uneducated and divided so they can be susceptible to commie and evangelical ideology. With all due respect to farmers and the rural folk they tend to be the most easily manageable, and more tribal and casteist than their educated counterparts.

                            The facts speak for themselves. Over 70% of rural households own less than 1 hectare of land. The uneconomic size of their holdings makes agricultural non-lucrative, which is why we have millions of farmers moving to the cities. It is estimated that by 2040, half the population of India is going to be urban. Unless we build new cities within the next 15-20 years, its a disaster waiting to happen. Is there any need to even debate on easier land acquisition under the circumstances

                            Two thirds of our people are living in desperation? Who is responsible? Only the Congress. The fact that agriculture is not remunerative is no new news. So is the fact that land fragmentation and over population have impoverished our farmers. The BJP government is trying to find solutions. The Congress never tried. They lived on slogans. The worst was "Garibi Hatao". After 60 years they could not do it. Aiyer is a typical congresswala. Always bad mouthing his opponents and sycophantic to the Gandhis. They never could find answers to India's problems. As Cromwell said, you have stayed too long. Now go, and be done with you.

Making agriculture productive for the farmer also has to be true about whether the "farmer" is cut out to be a farmer. If small time businessmen are not compensated for a "bad" business decision why should the farmers be only one always getting the doles and the waivers? If agriculture is made free market the real farmers who have the skills will remain and the excess land can go to create the much needed industries and infrastructure. A win-win combination. BUT then the politicians will loose their 'farmer vote bank'. So will it be done???

Do you realize why did this happen ... because no one subscribes to your crap and wants the country to move forward. You made a statement that Modi will never be a PM in your life time .. now that he has become why dont you take up the profession that you suggested for him. For you and your party the defeat has been difficult to digest and staying out of power even more so you oppose for the sake of opposing ... Be a man and work for the good of the country ...

What about the disproportionately high taxation of the middle class, where the taxes are just taken and misused by the government. The urban middle class is running the country, now they must also be blamed for causing poverty. Sorry Mr. Aiyer, you are so "out of touch" with reality!! It is politicians like you who do nothing for the farmers year over year and then try and blame the middle class. The middle class is overburdened with the responsibility of financing the ills of the governments and deep rooted corruption. Why don't you take some responsibility and have the guts to say that when you (Congress) were in power, you did even less.

                            While I do care about the man hanging himself(he shouldnt have done that in the interest of his family), I do not agree with his views. Agriculture or any other sector needs to reinvent itself according to the times. China, Israel and other nations that got their independence roughly the same time as us have already done so. Less labor and more automation is seen in every nation. The writing on the wall is simple. There are machines out there that do the job of 30 or 40 people at very low cost. Investing in such a machine makes sense. India either does it or falls behind the times. Politicians instead of spouting nonsense should focus on how the population can be trained to contribute to the economy and become a part of it. I am no blind tech worshiper mind you and cringe myself at the latest high yielding bio-genetic seeds replacing our tasty grains and veggies. If I were a politician today, I would close up all borders, work on decreasing the population we have and enabling the population we have to contribute. This article seems to say we need to sympathize with people sticking to the old ways and not progress. NAH......

                            "To make agriculture remunerative, we need to free the market for agricultural produce. We do not, because our urban middle class does not wish to pay a fair price". That last sentence is evidence of the ivory tower Aiyar lives in. To my knowledge most middle class families have either significantly reduced or altogether stopped eating fruits and vegetables due to soaring costs. And Aiyar's solution is to blame them for not paying enough.

                            Come on Mani Shankar dont write any articles for farmers about their flight against poverty and issues they are facing today. Congress ruled this country for 60 years see still your prime minister candidate slogans are "Garibi hatao" eradication of poverty. what you did for this farmers in last 60 years i think nothing yes but your congress politician living a lavish life and you guys started blaming present govt which come just 1 year ago. you guys are destroying this fro 60 years how come they fix it in 1 year. And specially you Mani Shankar who is a coconut(white from inside and brown from outside) who made chaiwala remarks lost all rights to talk about poor. so live in peace and let your other brown and dark poor fellow citizens live in peace

                            Mr. Iyer is so predictable. He has nothing positive to say about any thing this government attempts to do. He is so bitter, bitter and bitter, Nothing intelligent comes across in his columns. He is incapable of  presenting any constructive criticism. What waste of good education he seems to have had.

                            I fully agree with Mr Aiyar. The man has squarely and roundly hit the nail on the head.  Jobless growth has plagued the Indian economy as politicians of all hues and stripes have jumped on the industrialisation bandwagon. Industry in India cannot absorb agricultural labour displaced by Modi style industrialisation. And the industries that are created are those that rely on more automation than labour.

                            If there is a bandwagon in India, one can be sure Moron Shankar Aiyar will jump on it.  Gajendra's death is no different.  The content of his blog though, is far removed from Gajendra's perceived plight.  Personally, I subscribe to the view that Gajendra's death was a stunt gone horribly wrong.  That said, if we accept Moron's ideas, India will never industrialise and the population as a whole will have to subsidise the existence of subsistence farmers and the invariably large and needy families that are part and parcel of a farmer's life. Agriculture can only be worthwhile where there are economies of scale.  Millions of subsistence farmers owning an acre each will simply not achieve that.  Thus industrialisation is a must to give displaced farmers and their families the opportunities that Moron and his ilk have enjoyed.  Modi will achieve that.  On the other if, God forbid, Moron's hero Rahul comes to power, he will continue with Nehru's legacy; i.e., keep the poor of India poor so that the likes of Nehru's parivar can benefit.  Had industrialisation started during Nehru's era, India would have been self sufficient in weapons production and hence grandson Rajiv would not have been able to swindle the billions in the Borfor's scam.

                            Why don't you try some stunt like that Mr Aiyar and see how many people pray that stunt to go wrong ? You must be the biggest shameless guy - Any self respecting guy would have stop writing these kind of opinion/ blogs after seeing the kind of response / comments.

                            This state of affair of agriculture is definitely not the result of last one years misgovernance if we can say so.what our past rulers has done over last decades, it is the logical outcome of that only.So there has to be a collaborative effort to bring properity to the farmer,where party &amp; politics has to take the back seat.

                            Shame on u Manishanker if u mean to say india's agriculture has suffered in last ten months. What has ur dynasty done in last sixty years can not b blamed on new regime of less than a year. There were more suicides during ur corrupt regime. Millions of tons of food grains rotted in the open. U just shut up n learn from chaiwala.

                            What farmers generally have exposed is that they cannot go on a foreign holiday for 60 days. In fact they cannot go on any holiday for 60 days.

                            Iyer,Who neglected Agriculture?Who introduced liberalization in 1991 without studying effects? Who failed to focus on developing rural infrastructure?For the non-recovered IRDP loans, if you had deployed villagers to lay down roads to repy the loan, Villages would have cherished.
