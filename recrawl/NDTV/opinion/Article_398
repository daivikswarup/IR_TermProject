Headline::::I, Shirin Dalvi, an Underground Citizen of India



DateTime::::2015-02-04T18:16:00+05:30



(Shirin Dalvi, 46, was the editor of Urdu daily Avadhnama,Â based in Thane's Mumbra.)
	I, Shirin Dalvi, begin with an apology for having printed the title cover of Charlie Hebdo. It was a mistake and I had no intention to hurt the feelings of my community. Like any other Muslim, I deeply respect Prophet Mohammed - sallallahu alahi wa sallam - Peace be upon Him.
	That said, since January 17, I am being harassed and hounded even after publishing an apology in my paper Avadhnama and other national papers. There are four cases slapped against me. I have not been able to go back home since then and my children have stopped going to college. I am an underground citizen of India.
	I am feeling insecure and unsafe. I have lost my job, my reputation has been tarnished and I have nowhere to go. I am a single mother with two children, and they are my greatest worry. What happens to their future? Even after apologising, I am being threatened that "an apology is not enough."
	Allegations levelled against me that I printed the cover deliberately even after being stopped are baseless and untrue. There is a mountain of lies which is being used against me because of personal differences.
	So how did I make the mistake? There was a statement of the Pope following the Paris attacks where he had said that "Those who mock religion might face dangerous consequences." As an illustration, I wanted to use a Charlie Hebdo cover. But since I didn't understand what was written in French, I did not realize I was making a mistake. That's exactly how inadvertently this happened.
	The newspaper has shut down. I and many others have lost our jobs. I apologize to all of them for their hardship. But can I now appeal to those who are still upset: please forgive, forget and move ahead.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            (1) It looks like she did it by mistake<br/>
(2) Even if she did it intentionally, she has apologized and hence she should be pardoned.<br/>
(3) Even if she had not apologized, there is no justification in threatening the lady.<br/><br/>
From a fundamentalist muslim; a muslim who is striving to stick to the fundamentals of Islam.

                            Now, why to make innocent people victims of ignorance. <br/>
India is secular country no secular organization like police and law enforcing agencies and the government will come forward to protect and rescue them from rascles and scoundrels who misuse religion to intimidate others. Loosing job is another thing some individuals taking advantage of situation to exploit poor individual especially a women is henious crime.

                            Shirin, no woman organization is at your rescure, nO NGO, no Secular, not even Media. coz you've reported something on so called peaceful community. If it would've been against to Lord Ram, or Krishna all of the above would've come after you applauding by digging in all puranas. Apprciate your gut to report the news as it happens. Media once again proves they are paid and sickular.

                            your apologies are fine. However, there is no tolerance from your own sect, that is the problem. When we saw pictures of Hindu deities printed on closets and Mahatma Gandhi on Beer Bottles, just a protest through media and giving voice to it is enough, instead of getting down to the 600 AD barbaric Islamic activities. This tolerance quotient is missing

                            Because she is hounded by Islamic terrorists, this news will never reach front page of any "secular" Indian news paper or prime time of TV news channels. If Bajrag Dal protests peacefully against anything, all the journalists compete to criticize them.

                            India remains a society based on superstition, which is what religion really is. The sooner India develops on the path of reason the beeter it will be. Nothing is immune from criicism based on reason. The concept of a supreme deity is a man made one. And is, in essence, reflective of a dictatorial value system.
