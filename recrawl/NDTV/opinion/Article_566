Headline::::When Cops Throw Bricks or Shoot Their Seniors



DateTime::::2015-05-15T21:14:00+05:30




                                The recent case of a Delhi police man, captured on camera losing his cool by hurling a brick at a woman traffic violator (in retaliation to the woman driver hurling a brick at him, also recorded on camera), is indicative of an increasing malaise in policing systems and people's behaviour towards rule of law.
This sort of behaviour of both the police and the community is not a one-off incident in Delhi - there have been one too many cases like this in the recent past across the country.
This piece focusses on the police officer's conduct and the proposed corrective measures being considered by the Police Department in Delhi - whether these are holistic enough, and how else can we work on corrections for the larger good of society.
Just a few days ago, there was a case where an Assistant Sub Inspector of Mumbai Police shot his superior dead and then turned the gun on himself. It is believed that the junior officer was seeking leave, and was not getting it. This later led to a statement from the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, on the need to examine how cops can get a weekly off.
Leave in police services is a privilege and not a right per a pre-independence law that has not changed since then. Leave of police personnel is cancelled or suspended at the drop of a hat in India, a land of holidays.
There have been a few studies in recent years estimating the actual work load at police stations. Though not specifically aimed at the investigation function, these provide some clue about the existing gap.
A recently-released Bureau of Police Research report on eight-hour shifts in police stations looked at the existing "supply" and found that the majority of police stations had its staff putting in work days stretching from 11 to 14 hours. Further, most police station members could get only one or two weekdays off during the month. The report estimates that to enable policemen to work 48 hours a week with an assured weekly holiday, it will take 68% enhancements in the police stations' strength. Another highlight was that of the total strength, only a third was posted in police stations, though, admittedly, it was the most important part of police organisation. Indian police strength is 2.28 million personnel with a vacancy of 24.56% as on 1.1.2014. Source: BPRD (Bureau of Police Research and Development)
When departments have large vacancies, it leads to increased pressure on the present strength which has its own (often stress-induced) destructive behaviour.
This is expressed within the service and people in incidents termed road rage and other violence which are repeating far too often. The key difference is that just a few get publicly exposed while others go unreported, but leave behind increased hostility and a disconnect both within the department and between the cops and the people.
Such a situation cannot go on and needs urgent repair. It's a question of life and limb of the nation.
Here are two initiatives noticed:
1. By the Police Commissioner in Mumbai where the Mumbai Police has started to look for answers to certain stress-induced or related behaviours. The rank and file have come together in batches to undergo psychological analysis to identify problems and seek remedies both for the individual and departmental resource management. The exercise is being led by Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria with the support of the Bombay Psychiatric Society. The questionnaire being filled by cops comprises of 68 questions which includes their conduct with their family, their relationship with their colleagues, and even this: "I have difficulty in remembering what I did the previous night after I was drunk".
Seniors leading this first batch said, "A larger message needed to be sent to the force that they should fill the forms with honesty and that they should not think their careers would be affected if they speak up against their seniors".
The officers assured the ranks that their responses shall be kept confidential and dealt with only by the experts. They will evaluate and contact the concerned officer directly to suggest remedial measures required. They will, as the expert said, identify those fighting depression, stress, or addiction will be approached for treatment.
The Mumbai Police leadership has decided to cover the entire 50,000 force for psychological analysis.
Why not do something similar in other states? This in fact needs to be an ongoing exercise inbuilt to stay ahead and stay alert.
2. By Delhi Police Commissioner BN Bassi when he said, "We will need systemic changes to see that even under pressure, our officers act as per the law. No matter what the situation, they must behave with courtesy and not lose their temper." He further said, "As far as training of our officers is concerned, our objective is to see that our officers must not react out of rage".
He also suggested that policemen should carry devices to make sure their interactions with the public are recorded on audio tape or camera. He said the aim at the training level was to nurture among the personnel the ability to stay calm.
Staying calm, managing stress, the capacity to absorb hostility, feeling of deprivation of certain basic essentials, family and social responsibilities, and financial inadequacies to meet the expectations of growing children, single-income families...all this needs advanced management techniques.
There is a strong case for a comprehensive approach to Human Resource Management in police services, which ensures constant watch by seniors, periodic review, career progression, medical check-ups, closer communication, family welfare, etc.
In brief, 3 Es... Empowerment, Engagement, and an Ecosystem in human resource management.

                            i dont think kiran bedi shud give such a big biodata about herself (as given in the end of this article in italics). humility requires a smaller biodata. besides, who doesn't know about her.

                            This is well balanced expression on how to address the pattern rather than switching to sides. Police are under tremendous stress. It is quite difficult to keep temper when they are not respected on roads. people jump signals, go wrong way, dont even stop some times ignoring Police's request. And they are on the road, under sun, rain and in the middle of severe cold. they keep breathing highly polluted gases all the day. Do we acknowledge and respect them?

                            Ms Bedi has only scratched the surface with very basic suggestions. We must realise that police is the only arm of the law that keeps people from doing wrong, they are the only force we have who can keep us safe from harm. Yet, there is a huge disconnect between the the two segments. I feel the root cause is the police being kept under political masters. Politicians use them for their own purpose in protecting their own goons and regularising wrong doings. If they are made independent like the military is you will find a huge change in the country. The present policeman lacks pride in his uniform, no one can be the keeper of law unless they believe in what they do and the belief can only come when they are allowed to fulfill their obligations and not be treated as keeps.

                            @Shrey: It's possible that Ndtv may have written the bio-data instead of her. Also, there are plenty of young, completely unaware people in this country and it wouldn't surprise me if they were unaware of Bedi's meritorious service as a police officer decades ago and how much she contributed towards prison reforms.

                            Ms Bedi, the video shows the woman throwing the brick at traffic constable's bike and not at him. We know you belong from Delhi Police but please try to be honest, at least in those cases where the entire incidents are captured on camera.

                            Police reforms are a must. The Indian police still lives with a colonial mindset and looks down upon the public they police as beholden to them. Not for them to serve, but to serve them. In spite of several Supreme Court orders, reforms have not happened. Primarily because state governments have not done it. It requires strong political will. Which is lacking in this particular area. State governments feel they will lose control if the police powers are transferred to another authority. Bedi's views are likely to remain as pious wishes. No dramatic change will take place as long as law and order remains a state subject. It should be shifted to the concurrent list.

                            An advise to Ms Bedi... Make the Indian Police Service have some respect. Make some reforms which does some good to the police also so that they don't have to do such things. A ticket given by a constable shouldn't be overridden by his bosses. Make amendments and see the change.

                            To maintain law and order police in civilized countries don't throw bricks but shoot with service revolver or use heavy force. I have witnessed such incident in the USA. You may speak politely with police to put your point..but can't argue. .and never be abusive and never scare him. But we live in india where everything boils down to gender and if police does something against girl whole nation is against them doesn't matter what she did.
