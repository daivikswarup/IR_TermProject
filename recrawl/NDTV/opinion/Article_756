Headline::::Disrupting Parliament: How Much Is Enough?



DateTime::::2015-08-12T17:28:00+05:30




                                For the last few weeks, the country has been treated to visuals of Parliament being disrupted on a daily basis. The House convenes, opposition members rush to the well of the House, the Speaker/Chairman/Deputy Chairman make an attempt to appeal to these protesting members, and then the House adjourns - only for the scene to be repeated as if on a perpetual loop. 
The Congress has clearly decided that the BJP is only reaping what it chose to sow while it was in opposition. Parliament lost entire sessions while the UPA was in office, almost always to protests designed to force the resignation of a scandal-tarnished minister. Opposition leaders at the time took pride in declaring that sessions could have been saved if these targeted ministers had been jettisoned earlier. Social media, especially Twitter, is proving to be a great source of ready quotes available to show how the same tactics were justified by people like Sushma Swaraj-ji when she was heading the opposition onslaught. Similarly, tweets by Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, taking great pride in the BJP holding up the GST bill, are being circulated by social media supporters of opposition parties as justification for their actions today. 
Clearly, what goes around comes around.
Being the leader of a party recently voted in to opposition, I find myself asking to what extent do these tactics of disruption impress our voters? Do people watch these proceedings and silently applaud their representatives? Are the silent majority put off by what they see on their TV screens, or are they just not bothered one way or the other? Does the amount of money wasted on these sessions resonate anywhere?
I've spent time on both sides of the aisle in Parliament. I've been a minister for a few years, and I've been in the opposition too. I've never trooped in to the well, and to the best of my recollection I've never shouted down another member. I remember that as a Minister of State, I was always nervous about handling question hour on behalf of my Ministry. I distinctly remember the mixed emotions when Parliament was adjourned without Question Hour. There was the relief at having dodged the proverbial bullet, but there was also the acute sense of disappointment that all the preparatory work including briefing sessions with the officers was all for naught. 
A few months ago, we had the first session of the newly elected J&K assembly. It was unfamiliar territory for me, having spent my first term as a state legislator firmly entrenched as the leader of the treasury benches. Within a few days of the session starting, well-meaning journalists started to tell me how my party wasn't reconciled to a term in opposition, how we were a weak opposition party. What yardstick did they use for this profound judgement? A simple one - the fact that we were allowing the government to have its say in the House without any sort of disruption or noise. I thought of explaining to them how it was just wrong to try and shout down a government only recently formed. As far as they were concerned, no noise meant no opposition. 
So is the Congress right in spearheading the disruption of Parliament? Would the media, especially the TV channels, spend as much time discussing the victories scored with good arguments as they do discussing the constant stream of adjournments? I wish I had the correct answer to these questions because it would allow me to craft the perfect strategy as an opposition leader. I certainly do not see disruptive parties punished at the hustings. The NDA, especially the BJP, happily laid session after session to waste only to be rewarded with a majority all of their own in the General Election. 
In Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP spent a not inconsiderable amount of time in the state legislature disrupting proceedings, including having their President fling a mic off the Speaker's table, only to be rewarded with enough seats to head a Government in the state.
If voters aren't going to punish leaders and parties responsible for disrupting the business of the legislature, if well-informed opinion-makers are going to applaud adjournments, if the amount of money an MP or MLA takes home at the end of the day doesn't change, whether we do no work or twelve hours' worth that day, then where is the reason to change an established pattern?
Excuse me if I shed no tears for those who today suddenly wake up to sign a petition because the GST bill is held up, and they want to protest against the protests in Parliament. Either all disruption is bad, or it isn't. You can't suddenly wake up to the damage of the UPA's protests, all the while having remained completely silent to the NDA's protests. Outrage can't be selective based only on the type of legislation that is held up.
I'm still not convinced that there isn't a law of diminishing returns that will kick in at some point when further protests will only serve to alienate the very people these protests were designed to impress. The challenge is in deciding when enough is enough. The Monsoon session is a washout, no two ways about it. What will happen to the Winter Session? Will that be frozen out too? We lost this session to the demand for three resignations - no resignations, no session. It is abundantly clear that the PM has no intention whatsoever to eject these three people, regardless of how much working time Parliament loses. Logically, it would follow that the Winter Session will have to be disrupted as well, because otherwise why disrupt the Monsoon Session? But doesn't that risk pushing it to the point where the voter says "Enough is enough" and decides to punish rather than reward the ones doing the disrupting?
It's an impossibly difficult situation to judge, much like trying to catch the point at which a stock market bottoms out or hits its highest point. All I know is that I'm glad I'm not in Mrs Gandhi's position where I have to take that call.  (Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            very well written. When NDA interrupted parliament session there are scandles of 1.76 lakh crore which is wrong according to constitution. In this case, Sushma Swaraj allowed Lalit to travel to portugal which is petty issue and not wrong according to our constituion. I am not supporter of BJP but just trying to analyze situation. It is highly possible that people will lose patience now rather than before because UPA scandles outraged everyone and in that outrage people didnt care that NDA is disrupting parliament. But with this huge majority disrupting parliament session will only backfire for congress.

                            To compare the current disruptions by Congress to the earlier disruptions by NDA during UPA2 is grossly unfair. Congress leaders are thinking that the general public cannot differentiate between milk and toddy - next elections will teach them how well informed the people are.<br/>
May be the NC leader wants to pay back his gratitude to the UPA bosses for their alliance.

                            Monsoon session of the Parliament is a wash out. The amount of hungama created by congress is beyond belief, for a party that ruled india for six decades. It shows their desperation , having lost the general election. THE PROCEEDINGS OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE MADE LIVE so that people of India can see the gross behaviour of some of their elected leaders. Democracy means responsibility and what we see is misuse of their position as elected members of parliament. The cost of this behaviour is paid for by the people of India.

                            We had voted a govt. To majority in parliament to get rid of corruption of previous govt. But  very sadly the big impressive lectures given by PM is not holding true at all, public is getting impatient with PM 's silence regarding its own MP's involved in corruption. Media is shouting hoarse of wasting parliament time, BJP did the same thing in opposition,apart frm that the frequent  visit  of PM to foreign countries ins't waste of money??taxpayers money?? Till date there has been no concrete investment  either from us or australia or china after making so called waves of popularity in maddision  square  australia, now again going to silicon valley.... being a oracharak does  not reduce poverty,does not develop a country.... PM has lost touch with the base,has become elusively high...only  show bazi programs are being run,to make sheep hoards happy!  We critisized INDIRAgandhi emergency, now psedo emergency is being run,where we are told what to eat, what to wear, what to watch,also what to think and  express! Anybody speaking against govt. quietly silenced or removed.... flip side  of a majority govt. It seems true democracy can run only with coalition govt!

                            Disrupting parliament is disrespecting the public money &amp; time. Very irresponsible, amateur and inappropriate behaviour . It would be unwise to blame only one party for same. It is the fractured mandate that is the producer of haywire behaviour without any concern to good work

                            Voters cant agree more to you. Its both NDA then and UPA now which has let down the voters. If UPA has experienced and stated that not letting parliament is not right, then why they now are adopting the same tactic. Unfortunately, in the name of democracy we dont seems to have any laws to run the parliament in disciplinary way and looks like speaker has a very limited powers. Anyway the rule book is written/passed by the very parliamentarians who dont want to follow them. May be this the reason, except for hand full of politicians, whole political class is not counted as respected people by the citizens.

                            Very well written blog.... Another point I noted is that AAP, the party which was saying all the self proclaimed high standards also playing the same standard politics inside parliament... They even supported congress for the disruptions.. That means the cycle continues and our parliament will be like this forever and the common people will suffer more and more.

                            Omar Abdullah observes that BJP 2004-2014 washed out entire parliament sessions, but still they won majority in 2014.  If BJP was led by the Advanis, Sushmas and Jaitleys, they would not have won the 2014 election just like they did not in 2009. People understand who obstruct and who oppose for the sake of opposing. BJP won in 2014 because the leadership from the states led by Narendra Modi offered a developmental agenda. The Jaitleys and Sushmas should understand the mandate that the BJP got was not for their obstructionist behaviour and own up their mistakes. Narendra Modi should not be made to answer for the follies of BJP 2004-2014. Omar Abdullah should not ride two boats at the same time, either obstructionist methods are good or they are bad, period.

                            Omar Abdullah still doesnt get it! He thinks UPA was rejected because BJP was very effective in disrupting the parliament, or for that PDP got seats because they stalled J&amp;K assembly. The reason why you got rejected both in J&amp;K and LS polls was because of misgovernance not because BJP and PDP disrupted Parliament and assembly effectively. Voters dont like it, but the bigger crime for them is misgovernance and rampant corruption.

                            If Congress had allowed this session to run and at least let the important bills pass, I would have respected it. But for me, this has crossed the limit of too much. The attempts to disrupt parliament were extremely brazen and lacked any justification. It also depends on the issue. BJP disrupted on the 2G issue, but that was something which resonated with the people. This Lalitgate issue is simply too weak and I think it does not resonate with people enough to justify a washout. This is also evident from the fact that Congress is alone without any other opposition parties support in this. I think Sonia and Rahul have taken this too far and will have to pay for it.

                            But there should be some substance in allegations for disruptions. I am sure Omar sahab must have heard Jaitley speak in parliament today and got an answer as to why no one and i mean even the die hard supporters of Congress had an idea that such flimsy orchestrated non-issue had disrupted the parliament. I hope he writes again as to how his eyes have been opened to truth and why he should be relieved that he is not in Sonia's shoes.

Since, not a single penny is back from the loot, it proves BJP lied to the nation and people rewarded it.  Sushma, Raje and Chouhan has direct documentary evidence to prove them guilt, but without resigning no probe could be impartial.  They must resign first.

                            Indian lawmakers (Members of Parliament) are horrible role models for their citizens: they are always on the defense, are incapable of civil debate and would say anything to blame the opposite side. Progress and development are not on their agenda. They would rather let the parliament not run and waste nation's resources than either be the bigger man/woman and reach out to the other side or participate in a proper debate. Indian News makes me feel angry, sad and hopeless. All parties and politicians are cut from the same cloth. All their arguments and logic begins and ends at 'but they started it..' 'they also did this'..'their prime minister is/was quiet on key issues'. Their only agenda is to protect and promote their own party. It must take a special kind of conscience (zameer) to become a spokesperson for one for these political parties. Here is what they'd rather do than talk to each other about the issues facing the nation: shout slogans during a debate of national importance (UPA) or address political rallies as prime minister rather than addressing opposition leaders to reach a compromise (NDA). I'd rather never vote than to have to vote and choose between men and women who surrender all values, truth and character to win an election. Voting is an illusion of a participatory democracy, because apparently even if you change governments, they will quickly adapt to take the pre-defined roles of 'the government' and the 'the opposition'. Many people dislike the Aam Aadmi Party, but if they fail in the long run at being a transparent political party which can deliver what it promises, then it will be a loss to all of us, for we will not have any hope for change in the political landscape.

                            Parties know their voters are not impressed by this game of "tit for tat" or this negtive politics. You did it so I. Social media have not influenced the voters. Buisness transaction rules of the houses require suitable changes, if required by suspending the party for disturbing the proceedings.

                            Even assuming Lalit Modi took bribes and indulged in corruption. He did not loot me, he looted a private institution BCCI and not public exchequer. I am more concerned about people like Shashi Tharoor who indulged in corruption and were made ministers even after the controversy. Congress is after Lalit Modi because he exposed the corruption of Shashi Tharoor from which his bosses would have been making a significant cut.

                            As the Americans say,"It comes back to bite you in the butt". People should remember that the tradition of house disruptions was started by Congress under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi during NDA first government which made Vajpayee remark,"Hume jab virodh karna hota the to hum sadan se bahar jaate the (walkout), inhe jab virodh karna hota hai tab yeh Sadan ke andar aate hai" What BJP did was only repay UPA in the same coin. Now this vicious circle has to stop. I guess it will only stop after the Bihar elections are over.

                            The short answer is its NOT right, neither for the BJP when it was in opposition nor for the Congress now. <br/><br/>
The long answer is our politicians are disgraceful, immature, just not fit to run this country. Whether its BJP or Congress. Both are two sides of the same coin. Any such behavior in a school, university, at the office, in the army, at home, in the marketplace, in a court or in a panchayat would be unacceptable. <br/><br/>
What makes parliamentarians so special that they can act like kids with behavioral problems spending week after week throwing tantrums at taxpayers' expense? The BJP did it for 10 years and the Congress does exactly the same. Shame on you all. <br/><br/>
We need leaders with logic, not kids throwing tantrums in parliament.

Congress is NOW disrupting parliament because it DOES NOT WANT to let BJP illuminate or debate anything even though the members of the latter are PREPARED to discuss or, if needed, debate the details of the so-called "scandals" that didn't even take place during BJP administration. When Lalit Modi left India, Congress was in centre, so what is all the fuss about? Was Lalit Modi a fugitive when he left India? Or was he debarred from leaving India when he did so? Nope.

                            BJP cannot afford to have a single tainted minister after their shouting matches over tainted ministers of UPA for half a decade. Not one, not ever, no matter how small the offence is. Unless the allegations are cleared, Sushma Swaraj and co. must step down.<br/><br/>
Being a BJP supporter, I found her defense disappointing. The courts gave a clean chit to Rajiv Gandhi long ago, yet she brought up accusations against him on record, during the parliament proceedings. By the same parameter, the opposition can accuse Narendra Modi for being directly involved in Gujarat riots all over again, he earned his "clean chit" very recently compared to Rajiv Gandhi.<br/><br/>
Intentionally or unintentionally, Sushma Swaraj and others accused of being involved with Lalit Modi are weakening Narendra Modi's grip over the situation and are rendering the absolute majority of BJP useless by giving the opposition exactly the same issues BJP's parliamentary contingent fought against.<br/><br/>
So, for the sake of BJP and national policy making process, Sushma ji, Please take a sabbatical before it's too late.<br/><br/>
Period.

                            Democracy some times is not as Holy cow as perceived. 5 to 7 billion USD had been spent in last Loksabha General election. Obviously most of this huge amount comes from  black money. Congress and BJP all take money from people like Lalit Modi etc. This is root cause. No body actually interested to curb it since it is the bread and butter for monthly/yearly salary from leaders to party workers. All cry for black money and bribery is actually crocodile tear. This actually fight between RSS and Nehru/Gandhi Dynasty.  Contrary to previous period this RSS has advantage.  Third part front is too weak to have any say.

                            Well the gimmick of Congress Party is not going well with the common man, perhaps the Congress still thinks that the people of India are still illiterates and idiots. Mrs Sonia Gandhi is not at fault for that matter she knows nothing, her party "Authorities" should be blamed for ill advising her. Holding  up Parliament is like holding up the nation. If the Prime Minister was not agreeing to the Congress demand , and if they had  had   reasonable materials to prove, the party  should have gone to the Supreme Court with a PIL  to charge the Ministers for their guilt.

                            Doesn't make any sense...<br/>
whatsoever. Are you suggesting Mr.Abdullah that this needs to be condoned as there is nothing established to prove and disruptive parliament proceedings doesn't mean anything when it comes to voters electing the candidates..<br/>
And if you are saying that money so wasted has no bearing,you need to understand as you speak that you too are playing with the tax payers money in broad day light. <br/><br/>
If the country and the economy has got some momentum to surge ahead you are better off suggesting that political cronies etc stop this nonsense once for all in the interest of the country and keep aside their crappy personal agendas at bay. We don't care about political parties personal agendas..That ain't democracy ,that's a demagogue that you guys carry on your dirty sleeves to try to salvage whatever is left of this country. <br/><br/>
We don't need these politicians,it's sickening and deplorable. People will lose hope in this country because of such substandard,morally immoral and fake chants that you all rant to be in power.<br/><br/>
You writing an article to share your view is welcome,but the conflict of interest with which you write don't make any sense.

                            No party gets voted to power because of obstructing the parliament. People look at things in totality. With this logic BJP should have won in 2009, for having disrupted the Parliament between 2004 and 2009.

                            Sir, very well written , unbiased, balanced article. This should be a wake up call for all the MPs and should decide whether to take the revenges or to let bills pass through and nation progresses.

                            A schoolboy breaks the chalkboard in class because the chalkboard was broken by his arch enemy x days prior - this is unacceptable even for school-going kids. Then why should it be acceptable when paid and elected representatives - paid for making decisions in Parliament and elected for being responsible, wise citizens as deemed by their voters - behave like schoolboys operating with the logic of dunces? The Congress is a veritable confederation of dunces led by a dunce whose only claim to the seat of leader is the fact that his mum is not an Indian by birth and he is, or whatever his claim is - does anybody care about seeing this guy in the lead at all??? What kind of dumbness is the whole Congress suffering from?

                            "Outrage can't be selective based only on the type of legislation that is held up" I think it is the reason for the disruption that is causing the outrage in the silent majority.

                            Please understand our beloved politicians.   It is not your money it is people money you are playing off.    <br/><br/>
No good thing being done for people.    Please concentrate on good things to happen.     <br/><br/>
If these sort of fighting needs to be done, i feel there is no need of Parliament session.    <br/><br/>
Waste of time and energy, we can do lot of cost cutting.    <br/><br/>
For these politicians we are providing cars, facilities, ac rooms and all other things in free.   Per day we are spending approx 100 cr for this.    If you we spend this to poor people it will be more help ful

                            A sensible article, although the anti BJP slant predominates even as the writer attempts to be fair and Solomon like.  However, the recent unruly and ungainly scenes in the Parliament may have already filled the 'voter' with disgust towards those orchestrating and conducting the disrupting first hand, but these elements are well aware that the next elections are 4 years away. They know that public memory, particularly the Indian voting public's memory, is too short and fickle and all this will be forgotten when they lineup to cast their votes. In their present misadventure, they are emboldened and fortified by this firm belief in the propensity of the Indian voter to repeatedly reward his sinning legislators on considerations totally different from their ability, performance and sincerity to their oaths.

                            Omar bhai - Disruptions to an extent of washing out the whole sessions were not the norm till 5-8 years back. If BJP was disrupting the parliament earlier does not mean Congress should disrupt it now. Doesn't make sense. Also, I think it takes time for general public to get a hold of what is going on, how much is the nation &amp; public loosing due to these purely political stunts &amp; then definitely public would object/protest. In future, if BJP is in the opposing benches and they tend to disrupt regularly, people will certainly have the voice and election stick ready. I think it is time !

                            Mr Omar, there were some media reported that you lost both seats you contested in J &amp; K recent assembly election, it was not true, if media report the news in neutral way it will strengthen our democracy, otherwise the shouting and counter shouting will go on. The current development in the house, congress party to blame, during UPA government their own MP sprayed pepper spray in the parliament and so far he is not in the jail.

                            I wish a private member bill be moved in Parliament that MP who disrupt Parliament will have to pay for the cost of the lost time. As a Citizen I feel hurt and shamed that our MPs are behaving in such undemocratic manner by not letting Parliament Function. I expected Indian National Congress will lead the way in transforming how Parliament function. There seems to be no difference between the BJP and Congress both come across as the two faces of the same coin. I think we the people are totally to blame. Today the average person admires muscle power and not the power of debate and reasoning or for that matter the power of the pen. Sad but true. We should all work towards changing this narrative to Power of Debate and Reason and the Power of Pen. Jai Hind.

                            People's representative do all the things which we voter do outside.End justifies the  means. Precedent has already set.Abdullah's observation is meat for ideal situation.Here is a competition amongst representatives to score points for bad conduct? Voters cannot do much.

                            It would be wonderful if Congress took the high ground and become the bigger person by allowing parliament to function and debate legislation. After that go into a PR blitzkrieg and inform public that they have taken the moral high ground and allowed parliament to function. I for one would vote for the party who has the guts to do that

                            Both NDA &amp; UPA failed to run business in the Parliament. UPA disrupted and NDA failed to stop them. <br/><br/>
I am surprised most experienced party in this Country who claim to have brought Independence, run country for 60+ years think disrupting is the only way to show their power? Does punishing 3 solves 1.25 billion people problems? Do they feel they got the opportunity to disrupt after 10 long years so they want enjoy this freedom? As some terrorists say, doing bad things make people happy cruel way. Probably some dosage of such cruel fun is running. Even more for surprise, UPA Chairperson standing at the well and shouting - nothing bad can happen to this Country. <br/><br/>
On the other hand, Modi could have intervened and stopped this but preferred to stay tweeting, travelling. Also to my surprise, most active PM hardly tweeted about Parliament disruption except sharing Sushmaji's speech.<br/><br/>
It's clear NDA can't bring any reforms in this country. Need of Advani &amp; Pranab guidance arises.

                            Best and unbiased comment from Mr. Farooq Abdulla. In democracy, ultimately , we the people are to be blamed for any losses. Wake up call for people and remind your representatives to work for the welfare of people and not to score points on your opponents
