Headline::::After Delhi, Bihar. Modi Loses His Touch.



DateTime::::2015-11-09T01:13:00+05:30




                                I don't want to say "I told you so!", that would be pompous of me. But in this column a few weeks ago, I had written that Bihar would prove to be a second Waterloo for Mr Prime Minister. People looked at me in disbelief and disdain, the very same way they treated my written words before the Delhi elections - like it was a joke. Today, I stand vindicated.
First Delhi and now Bihar have clearly heralded that if people are promised rosy pictures pre-elections, then after a party's victory, they want the moon delivered to their living rooms. Instead, if people are offered the same old traditional tricks, they are bound to react as they have in these two crucial state elections. If the Delhi elections broke the myth that Mr Modi is super human and invincible, then Bihar has declared that he has massively lost the plot and historical opportunity to set right the wrongs of previous Congress regimes.
Whether Modi supporters like it or not, the blame can't be shifted to Amit Shah and the leaders of Bihar for not doing their homework. Knowing Modi as a Control Freak, these leaders were only pursuing what was dictated to them. Amit Shah, being completely out of touch with the ground reality, thought that by luring Jitan Ram Manjhi to the BJP's fold and creating a smoke screen of an alliance with Pappu Yadav, Tariq Anwar along with Asaduddin Owaisi, he could confuse Bihar voters with caste and religious considerations. But this plan was rejected overwhelmingly by voters. It was the same trick which was used by BJP in Delhi by poaching the Vinod Kumar Binnys and Shazia Ilmis. It did not work in Delhi, and miserably failed in Bihar too. But cheerleader journalists (their number is quite high in Delhi) bought his arguments without realising that India in the last decade has moved on and conventional wisdom won't be able to diagnose the changing mindset of the people.
I had said during the Delhi elections that the people of India are looking for a real alternative and in its absence, they look for the lesser evil. The 2014 elections and four assemblies thereafter threw their weight behind Modi and BJP due to lack of a real alternative. In Delhi, AAP emerged from the ashes despite Modi's phenomenal popularity and now the same has happened in Bihar. Nitish Kumar openly challenged the development model of Modi and the paradigm which his party was trying to build under the express instruction of the RSS (designed to damage civilizational diversity and create a monolithic socio-religious structure).
I rejoiced when Modi let his socio-political demons loose with attempts to terrorise the liberal minds. Modi's silence was felt by every section of society on issues like the murder ofÂ  Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri and the killing of writer MM Kalburgi; I knew this would cost the BJP just like during the UP by-elections last year. The BJP lost badly. Yogi Adityanath was their main warrior then. It is said that those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it. In his arrogance, Modi took no cues from the UP by-elections and believed that the RSS agenda will get him votes. He was so out of synch with realities.
It was said that Lalu teaming up with Nitish would be the undoing of theÂ Mahagatbandhan and BJP thought this would remind people of "Jungle Raj" (lawlessness) during Lalu's terms as Chief Minister and would put them off, and in the end, the BJP would be winner. But Bihar is no longer the Bihar of 1991. It has changed. If Lalu provided a new awakening among backward sections in the 90s which broke the political monopoly of upper castes, he also committed the mistake of not translating this social empowerment of Dalits and backwards into economic empowerment. And soon Lalu's own community rejected him and chose Nitish instead.
Nitish being the face of the Grand Alliance and Lalu backing him consolidated the gains of the politics of backward castes into an unprecedented social assertion that is reflected in the Bihar results. Lalu knew ahead of the campaign that his time is up and his style of politics won't be acceptable. Within the backward castes, Lalu is the past and Nitish the present. And he backed Nitish to the hilt. Like Delhi, Bihar provided a new alternative, a real alternative, a new paradigm of development and socio-political empowerment. Modi, who was new in his innovation in 2014, was a pale shadow of his earlier self.
The winner is India which has again vouched that the idea of India is supreme and even charismatic leaders are not allowed to tinker with that.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This wake up call was much needed for the BJP, Imagine a scenario where people have chosen Lalu over you that shows how much you have screwed up. But AAP has no reason to celebrate or mock at BJP as they had no role to play in this. AAP should continue to focus on governance and prove a point

                            Congress has won 25 out of 42 approx 60% n BJP has won 54 out of 152 seats approx 22% means even Pappu has defeated Modi Ji in Bihar.

                            Bihar results are not going to open his eyes because he's blind and incapable of thinking sense. Hope one by one he looses every state and the next general election. So happy the beginning of end already started for this Feku (have no issue with BJP minus Modi/shah)

                            I think Modi/BJP would be kicked out of the power in next general elections but I am worried that the void should not be filled by Congress/UPA again. People of this country now need to discard both Congress and BJP alliances and should choose AAP in next general elections. I think Arvind Kejriwal should be the PM of India; not Modi or Rahul Gandhi.

                            Nice one Ashutosh. BJP need to check their arrogance and deliver on the development promises rather on looking at platters. Currently, there is dearth of leadership at national level, the moment India finds one and if BJP is still with hawabaazi it won't take time for people to switch to the new alternative. Nice wake up call to BJP to buckle up n start delivering.

                            No reason to be happy guys. It is not that we have not seen Lalu or Nitish earlier. This euphoria of loss of BJP (who also lost due to its arrogance) will die down soon when Lalu's Gundaas will ask for their pound of flesh.  Chor chori se jaye hera pheri se na jaye. Do not expect these guys to be saint. Jinka Raja chor uske mantri daaku hi nikalenge. The crux of the matter is - nothing can change this India. And this poor illiterate janta of bihar (we Indians are destined to remain so and perhaps we deserve this) will remain so for few more centuries. The seeds sown by congress will not allow prosperity in this country and some unprecedented catastrophe only (which wipes out 2/3rd of population of India) will change this country for betterment. Alas!

                            I know Ashutosh is laughing at BJP defeat. But mind you it is Nitish who lost too and Laloo won, as Nitish got 71 seats and Laloo 80. It is the win of corruption for which you fight day and night. That shows that  ppl are not worried about corruption but about their cast as far as Bihar is concerned. Nitish had 115 seats in the assembly earlier and now he is boss of minority JD(U). Laloo will use him to have his agenda of dynastic politics and corruption!! Probably Bihar deserves that.

                            Bihar is not the piece of cake for BJP for the simple reason that they did not have a CM candidate.  So for whom people will vote? Taking advantage from BigData Analytics and Social Engineering had benefited JDU. Modi's stage monitored monotonous style and rhetoric lacks novelty and charm. Instead of centralized leadership and control, BJP should empower local leaders and also make alliances with regional parties. Regional Alliance is the only option for National parties to expand in all states

                            Voters are intelligent and they know whom they are voting for. Had Nitish was not seen as a development man, the results might have been different. I don't think people just vote based on caste. It is also a fact that, even the caste arithmetic was against BJP for sure. The united opposition was not very easy to be defeated. Wish Nitish the very best so that we can develop and move forward as a country. I would request both central government and state government to work together for the benefit of Biharis. I think what Lalu is talking - taking fight to Varanasi will not be liked by even Biharis for sure.

                            Where was Bihar 10 years ago and what is the current standing vis-a-vis other developed States. Whether people ponder over these things before voting. In TN the Government changes every five years. But once there will be a good alternative then the people will vote en-mass to that party. However did not find the same in Bihar though feel that an average Bihari's IQ is very good.

                            So much joy Ashotosh is showing on Modi losing his touch. At a national level, today Modi is the only crowd puller. Kejriwal has simply lost it, and he cannot win any more elections anywhere. Delhi itself is fed up with him.<br/><br/>
Surely no one can be expected to win elections after elections in the current scenario. Even congress, which had the monopoly a few decades ago, is now happy to play the 3rd or 4th place. They have handed over the platter to BJP on the national scene.<br/><br/>
But this is a wake up call for Modi. For state elections, it is critical to project a local face. A PM Cannot play the role of a cm. Not sure what is preventing them from projecting a candidate?

                            Amazed why people are still clamouring for more of Achchey Din. <br/><br/>
Aren't they happy with the existing "Developments" under Achchey Din :<br/><br/>
- Onion, Peas, Tomato and most other Vegetables have become too expensive.<br/>
- Dal/Pulses are beyond common man's reach.<br/>
- State Govts. are falling over each other in doing the extra bit to ban meat.<br/>
-Rice prices are expected to rise by 70%.<br/>
- Citizens clean the mess they create and yet imposing a Swach tax for the same. <br/>
-  Rs15 Lakh owed to Indian Citizens declared as Bad Debt under Jumla Account.<br/>
- Govt took Citizens own money &amp; Account and Created Jan Dhan Yojna.<br/>
- Played fraud with Market Pricing &amp; Made the Petrol prices very expensive when compared to International Dollar Prices of Crude to Rupee Retail Prices of Petrol over last 18 months.<br/>
- Lokpal is buried and many other important Institutions n Agencies are headless.<br/>
-Planning Commission is abolished without any Niti or Ayog. -<br/>
- Citizens cannot afford or avail LTA even once in a year whereas Modiji is utilising the same every fortnight travelling abroad.<br/>
-Funding for all schemes for social upliftment, rural development and welfare of weak n needy severely curtailed in last 18 months.<br/>
- 100% increase in Railway Reservation &amp; Cancellation Fees.<br/>
- Without providing any additional facility or amenity Upper Class Rail travel had become more expensive.<br/>
- Banning Maggi Noodles to be replaced by Pataanjali Yoga Noodles and a plethora of Yoga Juice, Yoga Biscuit, Yoga Masalas, Yoga Rice, Yoga Icecream etc.<br/>
- increasing intolerance, hate &amp; social disharmony in the country. Dubbing anyone as Anti National who differs or disagrees or has a different view from the dictum of Parivar.<br/>
- All those who paid in Black for thousand of crores spend on Advertisement n Propaganda during elections given free hand to fleece common man n make money in White.<br/><br/>
Still people want more Development under Achchey Din. <br/><br/>

                            I will put the same questions to you as I have others critics:<br/><br/>
- Was Shah foolish to give more ticket to forward class and criminals specifically in areas where Lalu and Congress had fielded their candidates ?<br/>
- Why didn't Shah and Modi had Lalu's bail cancelled months before election because with Lalu been out of race it would have been easy for BJP to win more seats, what is the reason behind this is Shah so foolish or people unable to interpret ?<br/>
- Why did BJP's announcement of candidate list come out individually after grand alliance's announcement of their  list ?<br/>
- Are veterans in congress actually happy that under Rahul congress won 24 seats in Bihar. Are the veterans dream of taking over party presidentship over ? Will this is other way lead more radicalization of hindu vote bank indirectly to support Modi by congress veterans ?<br/>
- Is Bhagwat a so poor political strategist to raise reservation issue in middle of election and split the hindu vote bank on the basis of forward and backward class ? I can understand polarization but I do not under this hindutva ideology to bring hindu together.<br/>
- Who will be PM candidature in grand alliance for 2019 and is Arvind's dream of projecting himself as PM for 2019 over ? What about other PM candidates like Nitish, Mulayam, Rahul ? Has Arvind gone quite and looked not happy even despite Grand Alliance win is because of this reason ?<br/>
- Will congress compromise Rahul as PM and fight 2019 election under Grand Alliance ?<br/>
- If Grand Alliance fight's separately in 2019 how will the secular vote bank split between these parties ? Is BJP's increase in vote share by 8% in Bihar a signal that in 2019 forward classes will vote for BJP despite of raising caste issues ? There has been decrease in JDU's vote share and is Nitish not looking happy despite of win is because of this reason ?<br/>
- For Nitish working in alliance with BJP was far more easy and smooth. How will he work with more number of people from Lalu's family been in his government ? There are already news of kidnapping and gunda gardi even before the government is formed in Bihar. There has been decrease in JDU's vote share and is Nitish not looking happy despite of win is because of this reason too ?<br/>
- Looking and the Grand Alliance will SP and BSP come together in UP ? TMC and CPI(M) come togther in Bengal ? If no the will the secular vote bank split between them and BJP will stand to gain because of it ? Or will they will form alliance with BJP to secure their position in states and it is easy to run government with BJP than with allies of congress as they keep on bullying regional parties ?<br/>
- RSS had selected Modi as PM and Bhagwat as RSS chief who supported Modi, will RSS for Advani clan remove Shah, Modi and can Advani clan ensure win for BJP and RSS after Modi's removal ? <br/>
- All of a sudden why has Anti Modi forces like Gadkari become pro Modi and anti Advani ? Remember Gadkari was removed from BJP presidentship because he apposed Modi as PM. Does Anti Modi forces realize that only Modi can bring them a win which is beyond their individual capacity ?<br/>
- If BJP would have won in Bihar would it have increased BJP's seats in Rajya Sabha ? Or BJP thought it would have better to loose Bihar and get support of regional parties in Rajya Sabha which otherwise would not have been possible ?<br/>
- Shatrugan Sinha repeatedly been anti Modi a ploy of keeping a close eye by RSS on Nitish and see that the alliance is not able to work ?
