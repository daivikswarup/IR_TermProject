Headline::::Modi's Gita Comment Was Dangerously Loaded



DateTime::::2014-09-03T18:42:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)The Gita is one of India's - and the world's - oldest and greatest philosophical texts, and the range of ethical, moral and ontological questions it raises are as relevant to humanity today as they were to the ancients. More than the Upanishads or even the Vedas, the Gita is also seen by many Hindus as the one book that is most central and relevant to their religious beliefs. Medieval saints like Jnaneshwar embraced the Gita for they saw in its conception of bhakti a way of democratizing access to God for the toiling castes who had hitherto been held in thrall by Brahminism. Whether religious or atheist, Hindu or non-Hindu, a follower of Advaita or any of the other schools of Indian philosophy, bigoted or democratic, there is hardly any Indian who does not consciously or unconsciously revisit the universalist arguments Krishna and Arjun had on the battlefield of the Mahabharata, who does not find himself or herself confronted with the same set of solutions to the dilemmas that life constantly poses, who does not remain conflicted by the challenges of dharma - duty, obligation, and responsibility.Having done so, this is not to say that some or even many may reject the decisions Arjuna finally took. Ambedkar famously saw in Krishna's logic nothing but a defence of killing and war for the sake of property.Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India and the job he has comes with a definite sense of dharma. During his visit to Tokyo, he presented Emperor Akihito with a copy of the Gita, a simple but elegant gift. I don't know what significance Modi himself attached to the book but the manner in which he later taunted "secular friends" by claiming they were likely to object to his choice of the Gita as 'communal' suggests the PM has not digested or understood the contents of the book very well. Â At one level, this ought not to surprise us. We know, for example, from the 'do your rajdharma' advice Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave him in 2002 that Modi was seen as someone who forgets or is unsure about what the duty and obligations of a ruler really entail.We know from the Gita, and from the late Prof Bimal K Matilal's explorations of the Mahabharata's moral dilemmas, that Krishna regarded dharma as something that was fluid and flexible. "But this flexibility," Matilal writes, "never means the 'anything goes' kind of morality." Rulers confront all kinds of situations and challenges so rajdharma has to be adaptable and contingent. But there is a limit to what can be considered morally acceptable. In 2002, Vajpayee hinted in his own way that the limit had been crossed; 100 days into office, Modi still does not understand where the line has to be drawn.Apart from taking down a straw man - no "secular friends" have in fact objected to his gift of Gita, nor have there been any TV debates on the gift as he apprehended - Modi is guilty of using his office (and the occasion of a state visit overseas) to play politics and introduce into the public sphere a toxic suggestion that diverts from the actual problem of communalism which he refuses to address. His words are intended to encourage the sense of grievance that the Sangh Parivar manufactures and purveys among Hindus: that their religion and identity is somehow under attack.On August 15, the Prime Minister declared from the Red Fort that there should be a 10-year moratorium on communalism, communal politics and violence. Days later, the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party - which is now led by his hand-picked nominee Amit Shah - began an inflammatory campaign accusing the Muslim community as a whole of raping Hindu women and targeting them for religious conversion. The party may have dropped a reference to the hoax of 'love jihad' but a formal resolution passed states: "Instances of misbehaviour with women of one section by men of one particular section, whether just coincidence or by design, is a matter of concern." Acting in concert, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - the very organization which Modi served directly for years and still swears by -- is drumming up hysteria over the issue and has devoted the latest edition of its organ, Panchjanya, to this sort of hate-mongering. Yogi Adityanath, the Gorakhpur MP chosen by the BJP to be the face of its campaign in the upcoming by-elections to the UP Assembly, has also directly attacked the Muslim community as a whole for inciting riots and trying to drive Hindus away from their homes.Instead of wasting time assailing his secular friends for a transgression they have not committed, shouldn't the Prime Minister follow his rajadharma and put an end to the poisonous political campaign that his party and his parivar are waging? Does he not have a duty to protect the people of UP and India, including all Muslims and Hindus who will suffer as and when this hate politics turns violent? In the Gita, Krishna gave Arjuna the moral courage to fight a war against his own kith and kin for the cause of dharma and righteousness. Read the Gita again, Mr. Prime Minister. And try to summon the courage to act firmly against the bigots in your own parivar.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr.Siddarth varadarajan's opinion about PM's comment on "secular friends" is very appropriate and needs to be congratulated. When the whole country did not find any thing wrong of PM on gifting the Geeta to the emperror of japan, the PM himself tried to mock the "secular friends" from the soil of Japan, is really surprising and makes us to think why he has gifted geeta to emperor and immediately mocking the "secular friends in his own words.

                            No "Secular" friends objected largely because Modi  had removed the wind out of their sails by stating that this would become a subject of intense debate. By the way  have you understood the Gita well to state that Modi has not?

                            Is that so? Then, what about the 'talk' that the potential PM candidate of the Thappad party saying to US official during one of their 'meetings' that India has more threat from the majority community in this country, when the whole world is suffering because of the communal elements from some other faith? Wasn't that dangerously loaded then? Have any of the intellecutals like you, bothered to raise your voice against that then? If not, why now? Just because you are more 'sick'ular than the rest?

                            I doubt that Modi will ever venture to do something secular. He has proved that again and again. From doing pooja at Ganga, to saying I m Gujrati, and now presenting Geeta and questioning secular motives of others on an international podium. Being from RSS, he has been inculcated with too strong ideas while belittling others. This would have been fine if Modi was a non political but being a prime minister and saying such things are bringing out his true identity. Read an article by Khushwant Singh, who clearly lay down the guidelines for acting like a pm. be driven by ethics rather than by emotions. Take an example from Vajpayee or Shastri. Come out of your Gujrati shell, they is lot of goodness everywhere.

By saying one sentence he has silenced his pseudo-secular critics. There is a saying 'chor ki daadhi mai tinka' meaning 'Seculars have something green colored in their beard.' Say that aloud and immediately all pseudo-secular's start inspecting their beards.<br/><br/>
He is a genius in state-craft, otherwise he would also be teaching in some shiv-nadar university.

He made this comment in front of the Indian community while addressing them in an event organised by them in his honour. And to be very frank Modi and humour walk hand in hand...see any of his speeches.

                            Sidhart, this article does describes your best style of writing and definitely some understanding of Bhagawat Geeta, and address the political agenda in name of communal , non communal. It is a good point to question prime minister Modi, and his understanding and believe on Geeta. But my question to you , Have you ever read Geeta yourself ? Have u ever try to analysis Krishna advise ? I do not think so. I hope next time u will not try to drag any Granth to your article without a deep understanding.

                            Mr. Siddharth Varadarajan,<br/>
I strongly recommend you to re-visit Bhagavat Gita, If you cannot interpret the logic's, then Please do consult an authentic source, before making comments like " Ambedkar famously saw in Krishna's logic nothing but a defense of killing and war for the sake of property ? - "Yes" his property was DHARMA and to Teach the WORLD about the importance, Significance and the highest VALUE OF WOMEN, HOW you should behave with Women, With Guru, With the KING, With Parents, finally What you should do for better society.<br/>
"I don't know what significance Modi himself attached to the book" - Mr. Siddarth, If you are any one reads/understands the real meaning/message of Mahabharatha, He/She would get attached to it irrespecitve of any religion..not Just Mr.MODI. It is for Humanity not just for specific religion.<br/>
Please STOP being Bureaucratic, and look at as one Nation, its time to strengthen our roots, and stand up as one Nation with our core values, and not for one family, or surname, but for the NATION.<br/>
After reading your article, I appreciate Mr.Modi's forecast by calling as "Secular Friends". Forecasting for readiness is one of the quality of being a LEADER.

                            This writer always takes the predictable position. More or less everything needs to be politically correct - perfect, which in effect means do not speak the truth, or speak the truth of the secularists. How very arrogant. The Government was elected for some reason and one of the reasons is to come to a more balanced approach and not go on and on about secularism. And this secularism has been hollow. Set one community against another. Let us hide the truth, long live the truth.

                            Modi effectively preempted secularists by making fun of them. When they cannot cry hoarse, they are left with meaningless diatribe which reminds us "Heads I win, tails you lose".

                            You begin by saying Gita is great and then say Ambedkar famously said krishna was wrong or something of that sorts...anyway, that shows you have no clue what Gita is about and perhaps start reading it again and not the PM.

                            Siddarth, your article lacks maturity. <br/>
 Suggest you should read and understand Gita. One can never be progressive without believing in himself which is possible only if you are proud of yourself, your roots and culture.<br/>

                            I would like to agree with Mr. Varadarajan on most counts. However,it is a reality of politics that it is a number game. At times it is the compulsion of arithmetics that would compel Mr.Modi to take a certain stance looking at his situation in RS. <br/><br/>
True,sometimes the actions of Mr. Modi do not match with words.<br/>
but, hey, the subtle message MUST go to those who have used the secular card for their own benefits in the last 60 years!!!!

                            Mr. Author of the above article.<br/><br/>
I strongly recommend you to re-visit Bhagavat Gita, If you cannot interpret the logic's, then Please do consult an authentic source, before making comments like " Ambedkar famously saw in Krishna's logic nothing but a defense of killing and war for the sake of property ? - "Yes" his property was DHARMA and to Teach the WORLD about the importance, Significance and the highest VALUE OF WOMEN, HOW you should behave with Women, With Guru, With the KING, With Parents, finally What you should do for better society.<br/>
"I don't know what significance Modi himself attached to the book" - Mr. Author, If you are any one reads/understands the real meaning/message of Mahabharatha, He/She would get attached to it irrespecitve of any religion..not Just Mr.MODI. It is for Humanity not just for specific religion.<br/>
Please STOP being Bureaucratic, and look at as one Nation, its time to strengthen our roots, and stand up as one Nation with our core values, and not for one family, or surname, but for the NATION.<br/>
After reading your article, I appreciate Mr.Modi's forecast by calling as "Secular Friends". Forecasting for readiness is one of the quality of being a LEADER.

                            Nonsense post.<br/>
Modi was right saying there are many people wanting to do stupid debates and posts, and have forgot to take pride in their culture, religion.<br/>
India is a secular but a multi-cultural and multi-religion country. We ought to respect all but not deprive the majority of it's pride.<br/>
This mentality has only done bad to our country, and hope is finished in next 10 years.

                            Hello Friends... How and why do you expect PM or anyone in the BJP/RSS to toe your line of Secularism ? You are just not ready to accept another line of thinking, which in itself is against the fundamentals of Sanathana Dharma...<br/><br/>
Seculars have their definitions of Secular and Communal and whom you call Communal have that right too ! Why don't you give the so called 'Communals' a chance to rule as per the Constitution with whatever minor deviations/ errors that can be attributed to humans ?<br/><br/>
You have lost the Secular Vs Communal plot in 2014 altogether saying that if Modi becomes PM, then all hell will break lose... We should have been ruled by the Military as soon as we got independence..<br/><br/>
Now we have a man as PM who speaks his mind out without fear and rules with a solid mandate behind him.. Do your comments somewhere mean that the people who voted for him are traitors ?

                            Mr.Varadarajan probably connects less with us ordinary men. So he cannot get the humour behind Mr.Modi's remark. Or is it the case of the pumpkin thief checking up his shoulders? By the way Mr. S.V. I was a very loyal reader of the Hindu since I was 10 years old. I learnt my English from reading the paper. I quit being a Hindu reader after u took over. Thats where you stand.

                            IN MY OPINION Siddharth seems to have not understood what the PM really meant that too as a jibe. He shouldnt have gone so deep and taken so much pain to explain the nitty grit-ties of mahabharata. I am shocked to see Varadha's article in which he seems to have jumped into wrong conclusions without understanding the crux of the matter.He wouldn't have written it if he only have read in this same space the articles written in a manner by the frustrated Manishankar iyer and Tharoor in which they make sure to bring down the decorum of The Indian Prime minister.

VHP and bajirang dal must open 'love jihad" cells in all cities to help the girls parents and relive them from the clutches of islamic boys. I wish the psudo secularists journalists sons and girls must be trapped in love jihad and these sick journalists must suffer.

Indians are tired of these pseudo-secular activists and journalists etc. so their numbers are now dwindling and all of them are now hopping on to some other jobs....good that we don't have to read their preachings every day in our dailies, but they try to find some kind of solace thru such articles.

                            Siddarth Vardarajan has aptly summed up Mr Modi's '100' days governanace and visit to Japan. The question is - what has actually been the 'achievements' of Mr Modi so far ? What has a common man gained ? No bank ever refused anyone to open an account ? Why a Ex-CJ a Governor ? I further quote from The Gita: <br/>
"The Gita -  advocates a moral platform for the leader to adopt. He is expected to lead from the front with an equipoise mind. He must possess a high degree of competence and must strive to work for maximizing gain for all stake holders (Hindu,Muslims and...all). He virtually performs a penance through a confluence of mind, body and communication". Why 'The Gita' to Empror ? Why not repilca of Taj ? His tweets/quotes thereater,do convey that ' there is a wide gap in what you preach and what you do'. Smoke screen can only hide the real objects temporarly. We the people of India, would like to see good governnnce which benefits all without any prejudice !!

There is not one person or article to ask why there are so many benefits given to minority and they not be treated as equal, becoz they know they will be harmed.

If other religions also respect Gita as an ancient wisdom above today's world religion then why the so called secularist opposed it to be taught in schools and to Muslim &amp; Chrstian students. All of you are hypocrete and your interpretation is danger to peace rather than what Mr. Modi said in his statement. He was right in his comment about the pseudo seculars whohave a sick one sided brain and unfortunately your article is indicating that type of mentality. If this is not what you wanted to communicate then kindly correct your writing and reproduce for the betterment of readers.

                            Ridiculing opposition from home when on the foreign soil shows immaturity of a person to the job of PM.

                            Why People are so jelous about RSS. Its not a terrorist organization. <br/>
They are promoting hindu dharma. People like it or not India is hindu country, Thats why its called Hindustan. RSS are nothing against any cast or religious. Some party are taking benefits using hindu muslim backword<br/>
words.  Making money out of it. There are only two cast to survive in this world. RICH and POOR. NO PANDIT PRIEST OR MULLA take care of you.

                            Varadajan like most journalists don't see harm of inciting communal and caste feelings of almost ALL parties for political gains. Protecting interests of Hindus is ALSO RAJDHARMA.

                            I can not believe that intellectuals are giving colour to Gita which is philosophy book. India has such a rich country with rich heritage that has been destroyed by Moguls and further manipulated by colonial historians...British left, but their loyal are still doing great job of discrediting rich history, science and technology that originated at this land. Instead of being proud, I am astonished how media is destroying it further...what is compelling you all to do this.

Who is going to do that for you Mr Sidharth for your bigoted views against Hindus, by convinient hiding in a Hindu identity?

                            Modi is correct in saying that...You are speaking as if you are the new age Krishna and nobody has a right to speak and only what you speak is the eternal truth...Please write something which is useful...

                            Dear Mr. Vardarajan,<br/><br/>
If I could sum up my feelings for what you write in one line it will be - "I Love you".<br/>
Such blatant declaration and calling a spade a spade is rare. I haven't seen many who can do this. Earlier I though you were pro-Modi, but as I read your articles I realized that you are neutral and represent that section of Indians who really want peace and progress. Not much an asking. Please continue writing, I feel so proud and happy every time someone has the guts to speak the truth.<br/><br/>
Respect to you.

                            Why are these fake seculars always indulging in a game of scare-mongering using words like "dangerous" at the drop of a hat every time Modi shows them their hypocrite side of the mirror? There were no TV debates on the gift because he nipped it in the bud before the secular fools went to town.

                            ``In the Gita, Krishna gave Arjuna the moral courage to fight a war against his own kith and kin for the cause of dharma and righteousness. Read the Gita again, Mr. Prime Minister. And try to summon the courage to act firmly against the bigots in your own parivar.''<br/><br/>
Well said! I only hope people soon see through the GOOD cop / BAD cop routine PM  and BJP/RSS playing. I am a Hindu and I absolutely love the philosophical diversity of Hinduism (from Ästika to nÄstika, from advaita to dvaita, from soumaram to koumaram); Hinduism is unlike *any* religion. This stupid government and RSS/BJP are single handedly killing millenia old religion by dragging it down into dirty politics.

                            Hey Nadar university Fellow! Dare compare Gita Quran and Bible! Do it if you are really secular in true sense and if you really have the quest for knowledge!
