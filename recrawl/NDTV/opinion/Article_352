Headline::::French Have My Condolences, Not My Apology



DateTime::::2015-01-11T21:29:00+05:30




                                (Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published in 2015.)This is not an angry letter, and if you insist it is, feel free to say that, for we seem to have a global consensus on free speech in a long time.A  friend remarked in good humor hours after the firing at the French satirical newspaper "Why yaar, you Muslims kill all the time?" It was a remark made in good humour, she suggested, just as my friends in Class 5 would ask me, presumably in similar fun ribbing spirit, before an Indo- Pak cricket match "So Pakistan today, na?"For the longest time, I have evaded questions on Islam on official fora.My faith is a personal matter and sacrosanct. Having said that, I consider myself a proud Muslim. I have taken the most bigoted comments on my work in my stride though most of my investigations seen through the prism of religion, judging by the comments posted on my pieces and the reactions I provoke in person from people who discuss my work.My reportage on fake encounters has been dissected with clinical precision, generating fury and an interrogation of my credentials, while my investigations on tribals and Dalits, for which I have received prestigious awards, have largely gone unnoticed by my critics and friends alike. As and when ignorant assumptions about my faith have been raised, I have, with the little knowledge of Islam imparted to me, mostly by my father, tried to clarify the misconceptions. My father belonged to the progressive writers' movement. While his Communist friends would cherish their whisky and cigar at mushairas or get-togethers in the 70s, he would sneak into a room with dimmed lights, offer his namaaz and then return to the soiree to exchange his qalaam (couplet).For him, his namaaz was a private and personal affair, just like his decision to kindly refuse the alcohol served at such mehfils.While he would never touch alcohol, there was never an attempt to influence his friends and seniors alike with his beliefs - the group included Kaifi Azmi, Ali Sardar Jafri and Ahmed Faraz amongst other liberal writers. His Islam and Koran began with the word "iqra" (read/recite). It was for this reason that the son of a zamindar chose to spend a good part of his career, till he retired, teaching at a government school in Mumbai, as opposed to reaping the profits of his family business. A majority of his students were non-Muslims.We, a family of six, stayed in a one-room kitchen modest apartment in Mumbai, situated next to an RSS karyalaya, whose members chose to spend most afternoons with my abba, their 'Masterji', discussing worldly affairs.Abba was popular as the Masterji who would get students admitted to his school, give free tuitions and make frequent visits to the shakha despite his ideological differences with the RSS. On Guru Poornima, his was the first wrist which had the red thread tied on it by the shakha head.Diagonally opposite to our housing society was an Ayyappa mandir loved by my siblings and me for the jaggery prasadam. On occasions that we didn't make it there, the pujaari would send it home on a banana leaf. During the annual Ayyappa pooja, all the plants from our garden would be packed off to the mandir, and mom would help them connect their water pipes to our kitchen.Such was the joy of being a part of a cosmopolitan country like India. When I write this today, every word seethes with frustration. Because, my identity today appears to have value only as a terror apologist, a Muslim who stands up to bigotry. I have to frame a politically-correct response post every terror attack, some allegedly by members of the Muslim community, and others where the perpetrators were clearly misguided Islamic fanatics who stand in absolute contradiction to everything believers like me have ever stood for.It baffles me when I am singled out for an apology. I wonder if my Tamil friends have ever been asked to apologise for the terror acts of the LTTE, for the suicide bombings by the Tamil Tigers, including the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.It baffles me when Brahmins in the country are not singled out when a family of Dalit women is raped and murdered in broad daylight in Khairlanji, and when the upper caste commits atrocities on Dalits across the country in the name of faith.It baffles me that never is a Christian looked at with suspicion or anger over the attacks on abortion clinics, or the seemingly placid acceptance of a white who goes on a shooting spree of innocent students, or a Jew asked to apologize over the carnage of Palestinians. Is an American asked to apologize for innocent Afghans and Iraqis killed by the US Army in collateral damage?Why do you sit in assumption over my morals and my essential humanity when you call me and ask me, "So what do you think about that attack?"Yes, I do not quite enjoy when a hundred school kids in Peshawar are brutally slaughtered in the name of faith. And, if you think Islam teaches this brutality, you are as misguided as them, perhaps why you and these terrorists could be in agreement over Islam.I feel compelled - sometimes pressured - to tweet stories of the religious identity of the officer who died saving the lives of journalists in France. Why? Why am I forced to let everyone know that the employee of a kosher supermarket, who risked his life to save the lives of Jews from a desperate gunman, was a Muslim?Why am I forced to post pictures of Muslims in France offering namaaz for the slain journalists? Why am I forced to reiterate to my friends, "Hey, listen, the commanding officer in the final raid on the assailants was a Muslim"?I am tired and embarrassed at having to reassert that my faith has nothing to do with the lunacy of some misguided rascals who claim to be protectors of my faith. They are as misguided as the Buddhist monks in Myanmar who are targeting Muslims in riots, the very idea being contradictory to the Buddhist faith.Yes, I have stood against anti-Muslim bigotry and will continue to do so in the light of the events in present times and that does not translate into being a terrorist sympathizer. No, I am not a "moderate Muslim" because the term is insulting to my faith just as it would be to a Hindu or a Jew or a Sikh - any faith demands honesty and not a quantitaive assessment or degree of your belief in it.As I write this today, I am also assured that bigotry and this mindless Islamophobia will not be allowed a free rein, and the front-runners who will defend my faith and its followers from this mindless hate will be non-Muslims.It is heartening to see that for every Rupert Murdoch who gives voice to this pandemic bigotry, there are a hundred other journalists, activists, humanists across the globe who are fighting an unpopular battle each day to defend Muslims from this rampant prejudice.As fellow journalist Owen Jones, from The Independent, who I greatly admire for his unrelenting journalistic crusade against bigotry, once wrote, "Those few of us with a public voice who defend Muslims from bigoted generalisations are currently fighting an unpopular battle. But it is the right thing to do, and history will absolve us."Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This just shows the desperation of this journalist to prove that there is nothing wrong.. no one is painting the whole community with the same brush. The journalist doesn't strongly condemn such incidents, but rather point to other communities raising questions of morale

                            On faith. Faith is essentially blind. There is nothing like logical faith. But faith is established when 'Belief' is built. To know is to believe. In order to know one MUST question. Any doctrine that refuses to be questioned is choking knowledge, so the ' belief ' is unfounded and the 'faith' is weak.

                            Yesterday at my work place a Muslim visitor asked me if I were muslim ? I said I am a human being and have utmost respect for fellow human beings and don't believe in religion. She understood and smiled and changed the subject.  However her 15 year old ( who is born and raised in west benefiting from all freebies west has to offer with my tax dollars ) jumped in and wanted to know what was I implying trying to draw me into to argue with her.<br/><br/>
Could not say any thing much but ignore her which she didn't like it. We live in a very political correct society and we are forced turn a blind eye to this sort of people.<br/><br/>
My observation is its mostly muslims who generally display their religious practices in public places. Why can't people with religious beliefs leave their religion behind at their home and live  normal life like rest of us.

                            You need not to be moderate what ever (religion) but you can be progressive with time. Religions which keep up with the time are successful to provide solace to people. Those do not keep with the time are doomed. It is your choice.

                            Why do I have to go to the trouble of reading Quran when I have not read the scriptures that belong to my religion? I was just born into this religion and never chose it. And why do you need to refer to Quran bible or bhagvad gita(My auto spelling correction recognises bible but not the others, now that is a different matter ;-p) to differentiate between right or wrong? This understanding comes from common sense and looks like yours common sense is derived from religion. <br/><br/>
If existence of one religion is causing so much pain in the world what do you think would be the logical next step? <br/>
Sometimes I wonder if we can generalize this more by saying it is men(gender) of the world who are inflicting so much pain but alas difficult to get rid of all of the.

                            If so many of radicals are emerging from your faith, there surely is a need for introspection from within the community. That has to be done by Muslims themselves. When people from outside will talk on this, it will sound as if holier than thou. The voices to intellectually and theologically confront the radicals has to come from community itself. And people like you are best placed to do so.<br/>
If more people like you had displayed this anger earlier, and targeted them to the radicals, a clear demarcation could be achieved between the bad guys and the good guys. Its heart breaking to see such wonderful people amongst Muslims facing this shame that their religion is being misused by criminals. But when Hindus get radicalized, its the saner voices amongst Hindus which shall be most effective in countering them. <br/>
It is your responsibility if you think you are an educated and conscious Muslim. Of course, as a part of greater society, it is all our collective responsibility too. But the lead has to be taken by someone from within. Everyone else will lend their heartiest support.

                            I would love to agree with you but unfortunately I can't. There is no doubt the advent of Islam was a need of time and it's a very close to God kinda religion. However, you should understand that there are people in this world who don't believe in religions and see it from outside. I feel the best person to see the merits/demerits (which accumulate with time) of various religions is the one who sees them from outside. Now, when such a person sees people giving various ridiculous arguments to save and justify their religions (or use violence), he/she feels that he is better off any religion. He of course, would find the idea of God ridiculous and would like to express it. Let it be the incident of violence against PK (which of course not that good movie), the Charlie hebdo incident or Christians pouring money in tribal areas, it all makes you feel that idea of God is nothing but a farce. However, if you speak against me, I'll kill (literally) you - kind of attitude is what making Islam (or a part of it) dreadful. This attitude is becoming powerful in Hinduism also in recent times. I don't think we should relate the incidents like LTTE, Jew killings or Afgan/Iraq wars with it, because these violence were either ethnic or were committed to gain power. When religion (which should have a soothing effect) becomes the cause of violence, one starts to question its very purpose.

                            I sincerely sympathize your situation. I full agree with all your observations on aberrant attitude of typecasting by masses. I am a staunch opponent of any fantist, be it of hindutva or a jihadi! But I think I do have an idea about why this - in your case? May be it is in your last lines - the history!! The frequency and recurrence of such actions coming from your religion's extremist - make you more vulnerable than a Tamilian or Jew or a George Bush follower!! Think it over....!

                            I have a few comments on this.<br/>
Firstly, I do not understand why you feel "forced" as you say, to do anything. That's the beautiful thing about free speech, you can choose to say whatever you want, even if that is nothing.<br/>
Secondly, having studied many religions, I personally don't single out Muslims as "dangerous". The problem with your analysis is that your focusing on how this is a Muslim problem rather than trying to shed light on what is actually happening. You said that these extremists are not really Muslim, as they do not share the core values, and yet you say you have to constantly defend Muslims. What you should be doing is displaying how this is a problem of control, lack of education and power. If people are being convinced of false ideas then this really has nothing to do with religion at all, but corruption. <br/>
So, in my view, you are aiding the wrong side of the argument by defending issues that are irrelevant to the solution. Start talking about how people are being corrupted, not about defending the people who are not.

                            What is required in the present day world is not more justification of different religions, but the showing up the useless and violent dogma which make up much of the writing in religious books. It is high time thinking people stood up to arm twisting by different religious groups in the name of dogma written by medieval and ancient men, which may have suited them at that time, and which does not apply in any sense now.<br/><br/>
The main people who stand to gain by perpetuating religious myths and does and dont's are the religious leaders and mullahs, who will be left without a job if people start being less religious. Countries like Saudi Arabia which follow a medieval, autocratic rule under a barbaric ruler must be held to account for their misdeeds. By following and propagating a narrow interpretation of Islam, and by implementing the horrid Sharia law in their country, they are setting a bad precedent for the rest of the world.<br/><br/>
It is high time the leading countries of the world came together and start putting pressure on the Saudi kingdom to start acting like other democracies in the world, give up their kingdom, and introduce democracy. This may lead to a more tolerant form of Islam in the rest of the world in the short run, and a more peaceful world in the long run.

The real change will come only when there is a March of the World Leaders and Million in Mecca to claim "Islam Does not Teach Killing" "Stop Killing in the name of Allah" Only then there will be a change.. <br/><br/>
If you are Moderate Muslim Wake-up and stop being a victim take a stand and demand from the holy Mecca no more killings in the name of Islam. <br/><br/>
Only then there can be a change.

                            There are some factual details that needed introspection before posting to public forum - Tamil aggression is condemnable but its a revolt against suppression -communal clash with vendetta - not remtely related to Framce incident. Similarly why are you attacking Brahmins for Khairlanji massacre ? The community was not remotely related to the crime.Kindly uphold tenets of good journalism.

Please note that the court judgement in Khairlanji case is already out. <br/>
Not a single brahmin was indicted or even accused/charge sheeted in the case. All the accused and convicts belonged to a different caste.<br/><br/>
Please check the facts before blatantly accusing a community of crimes they have not committed.

But you all have to strongly condemn those who harm the humanity in such barbarous way in the garb of defending Islam and Prophet! No religion on this earth is having an upper hand over any other. It's a matter of individual faith and belief. Gone should be days when some used force to bend others to believe. We live in modern times with world shrunk like a village. Peaceful coexistence and tolerance can only serve the mankind now with so much of destructive warheads strewn all around.

                            I'm French and lived in India for few years.<br/>
I think there are couple of things you need to understand :<br/>
1- In France most of the population makes the difference between terrorists and Muslims. Our president warned everyone : 'we are one country. We are fighting terrorism together, not a religion.'<br/>
2- nobody would tell you in France 'why do you guys kill people.'<br/>
3- that said, I find a lot of my Indian friends making this confusion. Why? Because India is clearly not a secular country. Because religion means a lot more there. Because the country was divided according to religion divisions.<br/><br/>
Now, I still think that as a Muslim you should do your best to help your friends to avoid making this confusion.<br/>
When the Imam of Paris says 'those guys are not Muslim, dying by killing is not being a martyr.', believe me it helps a lot of young fragile guys not saying yes to extremism. As a Muslim you have naturally more power when you talk about it. Not using this power because 'you are tired' is sad.<br/>
Those guys used your God name to justify of their acts. You should do your best to make people understand how wrong it is.

                            if there is anyone who is defaming Islam it is the followers of Islam themselves, I do not think followers of any other religion has damaged Islam , except for some excesses against them but that too is debatable. My only worry is there is hardly any strong protest from so called moderates in Islam against such crime committed by Islamic terrorist. Unfortunately we find far too many criticizing  for any atrocities against the Muslims. Lets all learn to live together , and learn to live in peace.

Why it is only Islam follower getting brainwashed more often why people of other religion is more logical.

LTTE tamil tigers were alos terrorist who wer fighting for "tamil" opressisty &amp; their methodology was terrorism killing people in mass with weapons.<br/>
There is no group who spreads terrorism by carrying weapons and killing in name of  safeguarding "HINDU" religion .<br/>
So why are people who kill people SPECIFIABLY in name of safeguarding Islam NOT called Islamic terrorist by Indian media while whole world media calls then Islamic Terrorist? They fear to call SIMI as Islamic terrorist,Lashkar as Islamic terrorist..knowing fully they have killed people many times.

                            It is unfair and unfortunate that you and other Muslims are forced to take a stand. But life is not fair or fortunate. Sometimes you just have to face the truth. Blame the terrorists for that, rest of the world is just following their human instinct to fear. You have mentioned violence by non-muslims. But if you are honest, you will realize that nothing can match the scale, spread, impact or horror of Jihadi terrorism over 15 years. Nowhere is safe. No one is safe. <br/><br/>
Please keep condemning the terrorism. You are doing good. But please dont stop to complain.

                            I truly believe there is something that is not right in the way Islam is being propagated or the religious teachings from Quran are being explained to its followers. Or else, how is it possible every major conflict in the world has Muslims playing a violent role? I don't care what's wrong or who will fix it. I just want to say I don't like it. That said, I also don't like the Hindu fundamentalists the VHPs, Bajrangdal n the Togadias &amp; Ashok Singhals of the Hindu "right wing". They all need to be treated the same way as any other terrorist/ org. C'mon Modi ji you have a chance to show the world you've got it all that takes to fix the Owaisis, Togadias and all such idiots who are only ruining the country's fabric of harmony.

Maybe its because you don't (forcefully enough that is) that you find yourself on the defensive. Either have the strength to take back your religion from the radicals or be blamed for those who have taken it hostage- I'm sorry but progressives like you are not strong enough to fight these guys.

But then I fail to understand that why is this terrible desire in these Muslim militants to convert the whole world into Islam. The way genocide is being committed by Muslim terror groups is horrifying. Then my request to you Ma'am and to all the good Muslims out in the world, start protesting against these terrorist. Why to give them a hideout in homes and Masjids, when clearly Islam doesn't support such barbaric acts. The Muslims who actually understand and practice Islam they should raise their Voice and show the misguided ones that how they are wrong. Instead of defending your beautiful religion you should be strong and committed enough to raise determined voices against these misguided people on the name of religion. And if they won't stop the Islamophobia will continue, people will raise these questions, you or me can not stop this?

                            I can completely understand your frustration but I am really surprised and also disappointed that person of your intellect and profession can get impacted by this. Most of the post, you explained how liberal muslim you are. The fact that you had to emphasize this is worrysome. I am sure you will agree that in world today most of these senseless acts are coming from people who claim to be muslims. And for any community, if there are senseless acts happening within community, onus lies on the community to speak against it. I don't understand why you think there is something different happening now and muslims being victims. There are enough examples of this. When Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Sikh community was seen as terrorists in most part of India and Sikh community did great deal of work to remove this perception. When Mahatma gandhi was killled by Mharashtrian Brahmin, many of the brahmins lost their homes as they were set on fire by those who put the blame on whole Brahmin community. Point is, this is how the world is, accept it and don't try to portray this as something specific about Muslim and as if whole world is against only Muslims. IMHO, the real urgent need of the hour is people like you who are well respected individuals in Muslim community, to come forward and speak against these fringe elements and make sure that common muslim man doesn't feel guilt of this, gets into victimized mentality as that is only going to help these terrorists to recruit more. Hope we all get out of this religious lunatic phase.

In this case, definitely you are NOT the custodian of Islam, but you might be the closest representation of Islam to your peers, colleagues, neighbors, etc. Of course, the intent is not to demean your faith or belief, but to understand if you could influence (if possible) through certain actions such as writing, discussions, etc. Having said this, I agree people are probably going overboard with their comments. But, try to understand that it is as much a frustration for them as it is for you!

                            No one is seeking an apology from Muslims or the Islamic world, if you still feel the need to not offer one as some sort of retaliation - that just shows how guilty you feel!<br/><br/>
You don't call yourself a "moderate" muslim but still feel compelled to mention how much you enjoyed prasaad, are you trying to prove how openminded you are despite your faith?<br/>
You cited LTTE , and dalit muders and anti abortion protests...let me add to the list... slavery, Hiroshima and Nagasaki ....but pray tell me were any if these because of religious intolerance...communal - yes, but religious - No. No one is questioning the imperfections of human race...its in our DNA to be greedy and power hungry but perhaps the issue is the superiority complex and sheer ignorance of Islamic world regarding their faith, in almost every other religion Hinduism,  christanity folks openly question and condemn illpractices not drop bombs to prove its superiority and righteousness.<br/><br/>
Like it or not religion today is an generalizing factor(maybe wasn't till folks started blowing up planes in the name if god) and if people of a certain faith unleash terror in its name, then unless other folks of that faith openly condemn and address the issues with it they are bound to feel the pinch of guilt.<br/><br/>
Also if you feel you're the only one expected to be politically correct...think again, what was George bush doing in a mosque crying"islam is a religion of peace", or what's with the whole"I'll ride with you" deal!<br/><br/>
Btw...thanks for letting me know about her book on Modi - now I know exactly which one sided , illogical fiction I should avoid.

                            I cannot but agree with Ms. Rana, why she is called upon to clarify every acts of terrorism done by a muslim.  Terrorism of any kind is deplorable act of cowardice.  Terrorism has no religion, creed, caste or colour.  While in a group chat with my colleagues on our way back from office, we were discussing the various faiths including christianity, Hinduism &amp; Islam, where the practices are similar in birth &amp; death.  Where then is the difference?  It is purely in the minds of individuals.  Though I am a practicing hindu &amp; an Brahmin by birth, I had several muslim friends, who use to drop by at my house on their way back home and will partake snacks, tea etc with us.  My mother never differentiated them and treated them just like any of my other friends.  That is the way of the Indian culture.  These differences have been created by rabid mad caps in all the religions and communities to perpetuate their hegamony truly exposed in a movie like PK. They are doing more harm to the fabric of the country.  Religion is best practiced within the fourwalls of the home.

                            Its fabulous that you were able to have such a wonderful childhood, and i agree that religious faith is a private matter and you do not need to be an apologist. But think for a moment at the madness and large scale grief caused by muslim fanatics, there is simply not enough moderate voices screaming internally within muslim communities that jihad does not mean violence. Muslims have appalling education standards which is a huge issue and there is not enough being done to correct this as well. There are fundamental issues that muslims need to address asap, if not worldview and pressure on muslims like yourself will only increase.

                            Who cares about her Apology ... As a nation France knows how to protect from the terrorists ... None will expect any soft corner from that nation on the minority ...Gradually all the nations who are affected by terrorism will join together to form a formidable alliance ... the consequence of which will not be good for the whole world as it will be thrown to more blood shed in the name of religion and terrorism

                            This is such an absurd argument. What you are comparing is a local phenomenon (e.g. LTTE, killing of Dalit) to a global phenomenon(today most of the terrorist attacks, if not all are done by Islamic extremists). <br/><br/>
Islam in its current form, needs reform. Most of the religions have gone through series of reforms to become more patient and tolerant. And the reforms are done by the people who actually practice the religion by opposing the wrong doings of the fellow followers (and not by justifying or defending their wrong doings).

                            Well, I am not surprised. This is the current trend among Muslim liberals. If you were to dissect their arguments, there is a common theme.  <br/><br/>
They say, <br/><br/>
1. a bunch of hooligans or murderers don't define their faith. <br/>
2. terrorists have no religion.  <br/>
3. Islam is peaceful.  <br/>
4. Western media is engaged in a smear campaign -- creating Islam.  <br/><br/>
Well, on the surface it looks logical and respectful. No wonder, a large number western liberals wholeheartedly support these ideas. <br/><br/>
However, this is the worst argument ever. Instead of liberating the minds of their fellow Muslims, it traps them into a vicious cycle.  <br/><br/>
These self-proclaimed liberals (including Rana Ayub), intentionality or unintentionally, send a clear message across: a) There is nothing wrong with Islam; and, b) Non-Muslim world is responsible for demonizing their faith. <br/><br/>
It does more damage to Muslims in a day, than the terrorists would manage in a year. <br/><br/>
Let me tell you why? <br/><br/>
All religions, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, etc are inherently and by design, evil. They are no different from a political party. The boss can claim to be anything he wants. In this case, a messenger of God, is the fanciest title he could assume. And sure enough he races ahead unopposed. Who would want to argue with the messenger of God? I mean who would choose to be called infidel and get killed by savages.  <br/><br/>
Except for Islam, the other religions were exposed by insiders (reformers) who wanted people to live in peace. These insiders overpowered religious fanatics and set their people free from the vicious nature of religions. Not that they succeeded completely, but they created a majority that understood the value of humanity. None of that came free. They paid the price - often in the currency of the blood. But they didn't back down or mislead people. Their struggle paid off in the form of democracy - where the rule of God or the rule of his messenger was rejected unanimously.  <br/><br/>
How did they pull this off?  <br/><br/>
If you have to defeat somebody, don't kill him. Just deprive him of his core strength. There would be no resistance. And if there is, it would have no use.  <br/><br/>
These reformers attacked religion and its ideology -- the bread and butter of fanatics.  <br/><br/>
Unlike current bread of Islamic liberals, they understood that declaring religion peaceful was a huge mistake. It would prove to be a breading ground for fanatics. Which is exactly what Islamic and Hindu fanatics are doing today. They are twisting the facts and creating a fear (examples: our religion is under attack, etc) in people's mind. As long as people believe in religion these facts will work no matter how ridiculous they seem.<br/><br/>
However, if people don't take religion seriously, how can you scare them off.  <br/><br/>
Which is why, the majority of the blame lies on the shoulders of Muslims liberals. By avoiding face off with religion itself, they wind up glorifying Islam. At best it is lack of courage. At worst, first- class hypocrisy.  <br/><br/>
Looking at Rana, I can say she is courageous enough. That leaves me with an unfortunate conclusion. But I am hesitant. I would not label her as a hypocrite. I think she is a victim of identity crisis. Even the best of us sometimes forget that all we need to be in life is just good humans. Not Hindus or Muslims. I rest my case.

                            Silly article. Who is going to convince Ms. Ran a that there are serious problems with Islam as a faith, her anecdotal props to the contrary notwithstanding. Muslims are nice as long as they stay away from too much Islam.

                            Hi, It's a travesty of truth when any attempt is made to paint the whole community with a tainted brush when such dastardly acts occur. By acts  I mean acts of impatience, irresponsible utterances etc. Look at the glee with which opinion leaders pounce on the community leaders to explain these acts when in fact they have no connection to that whatsoever. We saw this in the acts of terror in the country or even the foolish utterances of misguided leaders espousing Ghar Vapsi etc. Strange no one gave such leeway to Modi who was not even remotely involved. Why such selective apology or apologists?
