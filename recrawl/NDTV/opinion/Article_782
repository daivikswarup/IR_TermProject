Headline::::Dare You To Stop Watching Indrani Mukerjea Coverage



DateTime::::2015-08-27T22:27:00+05:30




                                As the Indrani Mukerjea story plays out over the next few days, a most fashionable - and politically correct - thing to say would be how a voyeuristic media has made so much out of what is, after all, just another crime, maybe of "honour", as we call it, or of greed and fear, or all of the above.
But it will be said that the media is so obsessed with celebrity crime and sensation that it forgot bigger more important ongoing stories, from the Patel agitation in Gujarat to rising onion prices.
There will be wide public agreement with this opinion. Never mind that most of those who will abuse and curse the media for dining out on a family's tragedy, and ignoring "more important" issues concerning millions of ordinary Indians, will continue to lick at every drop of sensation and exaggeration that boils out of this pot. 
We in the news media are steeped in hypocrisy for sure. We have no compunction exploiting other people's tragedies and travails for what is, ultimately, a commercial purpose. We are desperate for larger audiences, higher TRPs, or as I learn the new determinants of media power and glory four decades into journalism - and not particularly unsuccessfully, if I may add immodestly - clicks, likes and "shares". 
There is too much competition now. Our consumer has the option of more platforms than a journalist can master in a lifetime. News breaks so fast, and now mostly in your palm (on the phone); attention spans are so short, you can take no chances. You wait to check facts, get the other side's version, and the story has already moved on.
That is why a leading news channel feels constrained to run a "big exclusive" saying Indrani and Sanjeev Khanna, her ex-husband, "were planning" to murder her son Mikhael next. No attribution, no sourcing, just a stunning, emphatic statement of "fact". And the use of old style "allegedly"? Oh, come on, give me a break, uncle, don't bore me with sanctimonious nonsense.
Waiting for a story to unfold, for you to be sure of facts and fairness, is now passe. But that isn't because journalism has now moved away from old-fashioned values by itself. It is because our audiences, the paying "janata" as Bollywood calls them, are not complaining. Our hypocrisy is not just matched by our audiences' - it is, in fact, a response to it.
I will give you a test for this evening. Every news TV channel will dedicate its entire prime-time, or most of it, unless Mr Hardik Patel decides to do something really stupid to wrest headlines back, to the Indrani-Sheena, etc. story. Some will still stay close to the old values of journalism. Or rather, some will still do journalism. But some others will run a court.
I am tempted to say a kangaroo court, but am avoiding only because I do not know how this metaphor, maligning such a lovable wild animal to represent a summary trial by the mob, originated. On some channels, some questions will be answered, but many more raised, some dots joined, but the jigsaw left incomplete, for the story to unfold. 
On some, on the other hand, a guilty verdict will be pronounced. Many salacious details will be tossed around judgmentally without utmost certainty to their veracity, without a qualification. There won't be any uncertainty to the whodunit, and what should happen now. You are a rich, attractive, audacious, ambitious woman - it equals slut, social climber, guilty of murder. And hell, our judicial process is just so slow when all it needs to do is put its rubber stamp on the obvious.
Two weeks from now, though, check out the ratings for various channels for prime time this manic Thursday. If you find that channels that followed the latter approach drew several times the audiences of those that were still doing journalism, you will know that we in the media are not the only ones to blame for everything that you the people see as having gone wrong with us. Since you enjoy and pay for it too, you too are responsible. And then, as any marketing intern in any commercial organisation will tell you, never be so foolhardy as to fight with the customer.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

Many of us have stopped seeing the so called NEWS channels. And also Reading some news papers like Times of India for the same reason.

He forgets that unlike other products, the media has an obligation to educate and to be a watchdog. And it is in exchange of that obligation that their freedom is protected. Passing the blame to the viewer or reader is a convenient, but inadequate response.

I am a fan &amp; admirer of your writings . This is looking more like a chicken &amp; egg story. People watch crap because media shows it or media shows it because people want to watch crap. I think your article says it all - people don't want TRP's - media does. There are some excellent discussions on LOK SABHA &amp; RAJYA SABHA  channels &amp; the reason is because these 2 channels are not hunting for TRP's &amp; advertisements.<br/>
Media is averse to being monitored &amp; it does not want to self regulate. Don't blame the viewers.

                            It may please or surprise you (I don't know which) to know that there are still households in the country that don't switch on the TV for days at a time; some of us who give India news channels a wide berth. The nation may want to know, but some of us are not included in that collective.

                            See the irony. Launch of another satellite by ISRO has not been covered fully or given passing reference by the prostitute Main Stream Media (Mafia) channels. These shameless fellows are busy with a murder case as if the entire nation"s future depends on that mystery.<br/>
It is also an irony that many would have missed. In Delhi, a news channel employee masquerading as a student with AAP sympathies claimed to have been abused by a young sardar on a bike and had him arrested without any proof. Prestitute media goes all out naming the young man as a pervert and shamed him without any iota of evidence, Naturally the court granted him bail after realising that there was no substance in the case. Twenty four hours later a man from a minority community was beaten up after he misbehaved with a young girl. Instead of arresting the accused despite a complaint from the girl, the police arrested the protectors of the girl and the media went to town claiming it was a case of "Moral Policing". It will not take much of intelligence to fathom the reason for this type of double standards.  Media should not jump to hasty conclusions and conduct media trial. Is the press council and editors guild sleeping . Why they are not talking about this double standards. Shameless fellows.

                            Agreed with most of what you say Mr. Gupta. But here are some of the reasons I am following this case with a lot of interest:<br/>
1) the sheer depravity of the crime conceived and committed "allegedly" by Mrs. Indrani and her partners-in-crime<br/>
2) a woman who became a mother at the age of 16 and then refused to recognize her children as her own publicly, and instead had the world believe that they were her brother and sister<br/>
3) an "incestuous" relationship between the deceased girl and the son of Mr. Mukherjea (more like "morally" incestuous, as they were not related by blood)<br/>
4) even more incredibly, as per Mr. Mukherjea's statement, how Mrs. Indrani managed to hide it from him for 15 YEARS that a) her "brother and sister" were actually her children b) where her sister was in the "US" and what she was doing there for 3 years and c) she had been married twice before and not once as he believed.<br/><br/>
Far too many wierd things in this case to let go, even though the other issues may be more important with greater ramifications.

                            So basically you are telling me that media should not follow any ethics and must equate news to bollywood or Tele serials? So why bother naming it as news at all? Call it fiction and entertainment show. The point is do not try to justify your mistakes by blaming the consumers. End of the day being an ethical news channel or not is your choice. If money making is your sole purpose in life, maybe all the journalists should turn to other fields

                            Spot on!  There are 100s of murders happening in India everyday. No media coverage at all. Even yesterday, 4 people were murdered in southern city of Coimbatore. No mention of it. But, this sheena bora murder is everywhere in the news continuously for past few days. If someone who doesn't follow Indian media and watches India news channels, he might think sheena was a president of India. It's a such a shame that even reputed news channels have fallen so low just for the sake of TRP ratings. In their view, this is "Marketable Murder".

                            Mr. Gupta, while I agree with some of your arguments, I still have a problem with media channels assuming the role of a judge and almost passing a verdict. While media may mirror societal values and serve needs of its customers, it also goes as far in "creating" markets of sensationalism and shaping those very values. I don't think viewers are watching news to derive some sort of sadistic pleasure from assassinating someone's character or judging someone's life choices. Some of us are following this story because we are concerned citizens, because we want to understand how badly the moral fabric of our society has deteriorated and what are the reasons for it, because we want to act more responsibly as citizens and as protectors of law and order in the country. We were equally concerned when a few homeless people sleeping on the footpath were killed by a drunk movie star. We are also well aware of how many murdered sheena boras have gone unreported by the media because they won't make for a compelling story. If those stories were presented with as much interest and enthusiasm as this one, I'm sure the TRPs would skyrocket. We are smart enough to filter out the sleazy, baseless noise out of news. But to say that news sells because of noise, is to undermine the intelligence of your viewer.

Neither the police nor the media seem to remember this and have learnt nothing from the Talwar case. We don't want this endless speculation and allegations being discussed. Please report on the other REAL events happening out there. Completely unprofessional of the media, even NDTV. More than half your headline are about this case.

                            I do not agree entirely. Sensationalism sells, yes. But who is shaping public opinion? Who's choosing what to show to the public? Why do leading dailies choose to splash celebrity flesh on their front pages? Before blaming the consumer/viewer, the media fraternity should do a bit of self introspection and question the very way they have come to function over the years. For the record, I have not watched a single coverage of the case on electronic media. Print and social media is debating it too. I read 'opinion pieces' so I at least know that I am consciously reading a bias viewpoint and not let myself be overwhelmed with the contradicting 'facts'. The point I am trying to make is it is as much the consumer's responsibility as it is of the media houses to put an end to this trend of sensationalism, trial by media and some such.

                            We really don't understand, Why can't news channel keep tracking such investigation and report them may be weekly, we believe it's not worth to let people know each n every graphic detail of investigation being done by authority, we understand its good to keep such investigation to check if authorities are doing there duties without any bias,but nnecessarily wasting air-time which can be utilised for may be letting people become aware of actual issues society is facing.<br/>
Is there such loss of thinking heads in all news channel, <br/>
One question for all news channel- is trp the only factor to all news channel. May the sane minds prevail.

                            Very unfortunate , the media has no news important than this . One newsagency gives this alert, all other media channels follow them as the headlines. Many burining issues are kept aside and keep focusing for their viewer rating. We need growth , we need news about the status of the welfare schemes/ projects/ activities being handled by the govt, not the gossip news. Thanks that you atleast highlited this.

It is easy and even practice to blame Public for every damn issue in this country. <br/>
You also have chosen easy path like politicans to blame Public for behaviour of media.<br/>
Who is stopping media community ? Why do not they black out such private life stories/news. <br/>

There are earlier many times, we have seen very clearly and cleverly if not convincingly did mischievous English media coverage on many issues which were partially, totally against the norms set for Journalism.  This is not to gloat that the ruling party was good, never all that time.  Having seen the democracy of India, and its bad, ugly and conveniently changing truth orienting to majority interpretation rather truth driven has lost is loudest and truth worthiness in the dim and name of majority or money or emotion and attachment of TV channel.  But having said all the above, I still feel nothing is later than before.  I wholeheartedly  welcome your point in particular.

I am sorry to say, as much as i respect you, your implications are disgusting to say the least. Media has a choice and by not exercising it, the craziness that is going on today is ALL BECAUSE OF MEDIA'S POOR CHOICES. Each citizen, no matter what her/his role in the society is, needs to own up her/his actions. In direct response to your challenge, there are a number of channels that I ignore just because they are nothing more than Indian soap operas and TV serials (which too by the way I hate !) I am up for the challenge you have thrown. Now I challenge you - use your 40 years of experience and influence you have earned and make a difference at least in your sphere of control, instead of blaming everyone else for what is happening. Sir - you have a choice. Exercise it.

                            Mr Gupta, why blame media in general. Stop your paper from sensationalising news first. The public and most human beings like more positive news. But none of the channels give it. Who cares abt these so called socialites. Full of immoral acts and cheap publicity and money at any cost people. They don't reflect us. Out of no alternative perhaps but I am happy to switch back to old days of no satellite TV, I watch DD news where better things are talked about. The pride of our indegeneous cryogenic rocket launch which was forgotten by media as they were busy analysing the murder. None of the parties talked about matter in their life or death. American values being spoken of my children and your children living with our children. Grow up and get positive in your actions too than just words.

                            Very true. Media is just concerned only about the cheap popularity issues and not on really important issues that matter to the public and nation. Most people are also in need of such stories, though they do not have any  bearing on their life. A channel takes up an issue, conducts panel discussions, delivers it's own verdict. Finally what is the real outcome of that event? Big zero. There must be an internal audit to look into this by each of these channels and newspapers.

You make your pennies and pounds on it. So please cut the crap and admit it. Right from the damned day TV and in color too came out in our mother country,we have the sad spectacle of uncouth commercialism bidding for more profits in the guise of Ratings and in the process all lost a sense of honesty as also reality. In the name of SELF REGULATION,  the visual media plans out its own forays and comes 'clean' on presentation.  Yes, you are right! who is this Indrani Mukherjea and her purported sister turned daughter Sheena Bora?  Today almost the whole of NDTV is only of this duo!!!.  HEAL THYSELF PREACHER!!

                            wish our media devote more space to cover inspiring stories and people making positive contributions instead of wasting space on page 3 celebrity gossips.

                            Agree with you completely. "Media" is another word invented by you guys to hide behind, as I am sure, your professionals have still some respect for the word "journalism" and would dare to behave the way they behave in disproportionate zeal under the title of journalists.

                            I am sure someone may have alerted the police - but as is the case with our useless police pan India - they may have been brushed aside and no FIR registered. Try filing a complaint with the police and you will experience how they will literally harass you into not filing it. Its work for them and they do not want to work. Our police works only for those who pay them or when they are ordered to do so by their masters. The taxpayer salary that they get is their birthright. No decent person visits any police station. They don't work for the citizens. I am surprised that people are feigning ignorance at this well known fact. You know the reason why the official crime rate in India is so low. I challenge the police(pan India) to give records of how many normal people have approached them for not being able to see their kids/relatives post a divorce/family issue etc, and the police just kicking them out. Are there any stats to this ?
