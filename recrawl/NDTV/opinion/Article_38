Headline::::Dear JNU Students, We Fund Your Studies, Not Your Politics



DateTime::::2016-02-15T13:32:00+05:30




                                JNU has been a controversial university for quite some time. Professor Nurul Hasan, as HRD Minister, made sure that it became a bastion of the Left. Faculty who had alternate views were not hired or encouraged and sometimes hounded out. Wherever the Left has tried to assert itself, it has sought to infiltrate and control universities to ensure it dominates intellectual discourse.
Based as it is on an exclusivist centralised dogma, it left no room for new thoughts and vibrant debates and sought to shut out all voices except its dogma. The Left Front rule in West Bengal is a classic example of the capture of universities and their decline as centres of vibrant intellectual thought. Today, universities in West Bengal are a pale shadow of what they once were.
This strategy was also based on creating student unions which espoused the Left cause, and created a cadre of storm troopers in case of need and future cadres for the party. Since the Left itself is splintered, the extreme left - the CPI (ML) - tried to dominate student unions based on its espousal of causes which were archaic, often violent and always extreme.
There was no shortage of causes in India as there were issues of caste, land, disparity and much else. Much of the faculty were Left sympathisers who enjoyed the freedom and perques of a secure government job with almost no accountability and a ready cadre of students on whom they could work.
Students were often the worst sufferers as studies were sidelined. The faculty and the students always held themselves out as liberals except that they did not allow the flowering of alternate views, nor outsiders who could challenge them. They were a shut shop, a world in themselves. With a sympathetic government, they even rewrote our history. There is no better example today in India of the capture of a university by an ideology than JNU.
This is not to say that we need the Right to now capture universities and do the same. What we need are universities which are more open, where faculty is hired on merit not ideology, and where there is a healthy interaction of ideas and views. There should clearly be no single ideology or view which will dominate very much the principle on which our civilization is based.
In India, JNU is on top of the totem pole of Left-captured institutions, based as it is in Delhi, the heart of political power in India, funded fully by the government and focused on social sciences. A closed state-controlled economy provided the ideal environment for much angst within. Liberalisation in 1991 opened JNU to a changing ecosystem in India and, soon, globally. The decline of the Left all over the world, the increase in jobs for students, a growing media which asked questions, and economic prosperity started changing the equation. The Left has been in decline in India too with the advent of a thick layer of the middle class which is socially liberal and economically conservative, and which does not believe is the distant promises of failed revolutions.
The recent incident of Leftist student unions indulging in "anti national" activities, shouting slogans against the Indian Union, calling the hanging of Afzal Guru a judicial killing is symbiotic of an out-of-date ideology trying to regain its prominence. JNU is changing, becoming more open, collegial and more universal, and the Left is resisting change, using students to provoke extreme action by the State to keep itself alive. Students and their future have become a pawn in this ideological fight between a declining Left and an assertive Right, specially after the Right has come to power.
Prodded by an enraged public opinion offended by the anti-national slogans, the government's response has been unduly harsh, slapping sedition charges on students, arresting the student union leader and sending the police into the campus.
Of course now the Congress, the Left and the JD(U) have waded in, clearly showing this as an ideological fight, dividing  the faculty and the students. The Congress seems to have lost its moorings with its Vice President Rahul Gandhi supporting those who call the Afzal Guru hanging a judicial killing, knowing fully well that its own government executed the hanging.
One would have hoped that the government would be more magnanimous, allowing the university  to enquire and take any disciplinary action, rather than wading  in and arresting students, thereby escalating this conflict. Such arrests are worrisome because we do not want any government to intrude on our freedom of speech or our freedom of association even when people have "extreme" views - so long as there is no violence or a call to violence.
A sedition charge is outdated in a liberal democracy. The US has tackled such issues much earlier, even stating that the freedom of speech includes the freedom to burn the national flag! This has not hurt the US in any way but has considerably enhanced personal freedom. We need a more mature state in India, irrespective of government, where citizens can freely dissent, even promote archaic declining political ideology, so long as there is no violence, threat of  violence etc.
As for JNU, it is time the government asked students to pay the full cost of education; in case students wish to focus on politics and not on their studies, there is no case for taxpayers to subsidise extreme views or an archaic Left. Freedom does not include the right to misuse tax payers' monies. Further, the faculty issue also needs to be tackled. Too much of the faculty is indulging in politics, forgetting their primary duties - note the quality of research going down. Universities have to be held accountable for their output and research, not judged on their political ideology or political activism.(Mohandas Pai was the CFO and then the head of HR at Infosys.

                            Thank you Mr. Pai for putting context around JNU events! While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, the discourse still needs to be sane and civil! Unfortunate to see students organizations aligning with the political parties - be it with left, congress or BJP. Its perfectly ok for students to have the organizations; but it's purpose and practice needs to confine to its constituents - that is Students, faculty and related matters. If you want to align or dissent with a political party's views or a judicial decision, there are several other avenues - and college campus is not one of them.

Well written and balanced opinion. There is well planned strategy to bleed government's energy by creating such issues in universities.  Government should not fall into this trap. These issues will automatically stop if government starts ignoring them and continue focus on development.<br/>

Public sector banks, companies, educational institutions, government offices have become the playground of politics, wasting the country's wealth. There is no reason for them to depend on Government funds. Let them depend on themselves, then the true 'isms' will come out.

                            Mr Mohandas Pai. We also fund your industries when we allocate subsidized land and other tax benefits. Can we then demand you to follow the labor laws of the land, reservation and other facilities? You are well within your right to question the politics in JNU but why this selective entitlement over your tax money?

Mr. Pai, with all due respect, the anti-Nationals are becoming more and more brazen. There is a need to broden the definition even more to ensure that no Anti-National act goes unpunished. There is a limit to nonsense that can be tolerated in the name of freedom of speech, which even the SC says is not absolute.

                            Thank you Mr.Pai for a balanced view. It may give a wrong signals when we call out that louder asking students to pay full fee than asking the root causes for this mess to happen. Should we be asking the root cause or should we be asking the victims!! Left could be left and right will always be right, but, center pieces are being used and thrown in the bin. I feel, we should question the so called GOVT, Politicians and university professors failing to control, guide and mentor healthy environments within campuses. Every citizen should get free education than classifying rate of subsidy and taking such incidents to threaten poor students in that way! We have not seen anyone asking to do council to the students who raised anti-nation slogans in order to understand their reasons and educate. Some of our greatest journalists/media can only do opportunistic emotional act in front of camera to only benefit thyself. Wish, we keep questioning such elements, wish we keep standing against such opportunists, wish we hold tight to question the causes than the victims..........!!!!

                            Sir, with all due respect let me state something.<br/><br/>
Your expectation of students is deeply flawed and probably reflects your poor understanding of the idea of education. It is quite possible that you are expressing the need of industry, in terms of how their future employees should be- all subdued and without any sort of political awareness. What you really want is an army of automatons, coming out of an assembly line which people mistake as a "University"<br/><br/>
What is expected of a university is much more than learning and research. It should be a place where a young chap matures into somebody who can think and make right choices in life. Universities should be places where there is active debates and discussions, a place where students learn to respect and accept contrasting views, a place where they learn to look around and see what is happening in their midst. NOT a place like Manipal, Lovely or SRM, where they churn out graduates in their thousands, who are totally bereft of any social or political thought. <br/><br/>
And about the subsidized education. The money being spend for subsidized education in India is not even one tenth of the corporate tax sops and other benefits. And its quite ironic that a beneficiary of all those corporate tax subsidies, is now arguing for cutting down educational subsidies. And talk about accountability coming from the sacred mouth of a corporate honcho who ruled over a company (read infosys) notorious for squeezing the last drop out of their employees, is nothing but OXYMORONIC

                            This is an excellent articulation of the deceit and politics of Left.For too long now, the Left and its idealogical fraternity have a disgusting and shameful relationships with nation-state and governaments. On the one hand, they expect the State to provide money,job, housing and all the sundry necessities of life and yet dont have a shred of shame in ranting against the state breathless. For too long, the sham of leftists assault on the civilization, culture and tradition of this country has been tolerated.It is time that the culture of truthfulness, openness and truly liberal faculty and management takes over JNU

                            Well said. Left rule in Bengal was a disaster and the most atrocious in Independent India. Most good students would go to college in BHU as there were no good colleges/universities in Bengal. Left totally dominated the ideological landscape and any different point of view was met with a harsh suppression where the left party cadre along with police and other wings of administration participated. Left has perfected the art of violence globally and in India this takes the form of state suppression in their bastions and naxal/maoists violence elsewhere.<br/>
JNU should either be dis-banded or purged of anti-national and leftists elements to make it a contributor to national resurgence and development.

                            WOW. Mr. Pai what you are saying is that there because the college is funded by tax payers money, the college should always toe the line of the majority in the country. Are you not saying that ideas contrary to that of the majority of the tax payers should be stifled? It is because of this mentality of the rich to look down on others that we are still a developing country. Should not every idea be debated and the bad ones thrashed out and the good ones adopted? Or should all policy be dependent on where the funds come from? I guess we see the accountant side of you in this article. You should learn to enjoy an orchestra instead of whining on the wastage of having a dozen violinists instead of just one and an amplifier.<br/>
Just as human love, freedom is always conditional, but to make a bounds with money is just another form of slavery.

                            Is it time to challenge ABVP to a debate on nationalism? Will they even get past the definition stage, even if they agree to something that is intrinsically democratic - a debate!<br/>
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has a long list of taboo subjects that it considers outside the purview of discussion and contestation. To engage with these subjects or ideas is to violate the ABVP's idea of the sacred. What has precipitated the crisis in universities is that the Bharatiya Janata Party's student wing also wants to impose its notion of the sacred on all students and teachers.<br/>
The tendency of one group to impose its idea of the sacred on others has its origins in the caste system, which, as we all know, is organised on the principle of purity and pollution. Any violation of the ABVP's idea of the sacred now runs the risk of encountering violence, or invites punishment from the authorities, or both. This too is a feature of the caste system.<br/>
Taboo topics<br/>
The ABVP does not want students to discuss the hanging of Yakub Memon or Afzal Guru, or the inclusion of beef in the mess menu. It believes a seminar on human rights violations is akin to supporting Maoism, which is deemed anti-national. It opposes seminars on Hinduism unless these are unequivocally in its praise. The list is long and forever evolving.<br/>
Just how this form of imposition is linked to the caste system can be illustrated through an example. The higher your caste, the less polluting your occupation – but you would be defiled in case you were to shake hands with those whose very touch is polluting, or dine with him, or partake of beef, or remove the carcass of a dead animal.<br/>
You can choose to refrain from certain activities. That is your decision. You can, for instance, get another person to remove the carcass from your compound. You can, obviously, abstain from eating beef.<br/>
But you also have to depend on others to subscribe to caste rules for preserving your purity. What are you to do if the pariah insists on touching you? What if the outcaste draws water from the tap you too use, or demands to drink tea from the same tumbler as yours?<br/>
Either you will adjust to this reality or you will dissuade him from polluting you by striking the fear of retribution or punishment in him. This is often at the root of horrific caste violence in the country. Indeed, for caste rules to have salience, it is vital not only for you but also for others to adhere to them as well.<br/>
Caste ethos<br/>
It is this caste ethos, and arrogance, the ABVP brings to universities, more fiercely now because the BJP government rules at the Centre. Ideas designated as sacred can't be violated and what the ABVP views as profane must be shunned. In case some choose not to, the ABVP would pressure the authorities to take punitive action against them. It is on the fear of punishment (or violence) that the caste system breeds<br/>
Discussions on ideas that the ABVP considers taboo cannot defile its members. Whom does it defile then? It is the Mother, the deity that is India, whom we must worship. Her spirit infuses all spaces, more so the campuses. Just as Dalits were (and are still) proscribed from entering temples, certain ideas have attributes that defile Mother India.<br/>
This was indeed the theme of the statement Union Minister Smriti Irani issued following the arrest of protesting students at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Ideas of purity and pollution and religiosity are fused in the politics of ABVP, as is true of the entire Sangh Parivar.<br/>
The ABVP's list of taboo subjects can be arranged in a hierarchy. The most profane is the idea of self-determination. Try conducting a seminar on the issue on campus. It is bound to get disrupted by boys who will later be discovered to be belonging to the ABVP.<br/>
Ask for a just trial of terrorists – and every word spoken in favour of it will lead to the defilement of Mother India. Try to get Delhi University's Law Faculty to organise a talk on the need to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. It won't, because that is a taboo subject, as is the issue of observing human rights in Chhattisgarh.<br/>
Proscribed from university campus are even those whom the AVBP considers Naxalite sympathisers. To check this hypothesis, Delhi University should invite writer Arundhati Roy to address the students. It was the reason the ABVP cited to deny journalist Siddharth Varadrajan from speaking at Allahabad University.<br/>
Historical personalities can be assigned to a higher or lower order of profanity depending on the location of a university. It is taboo to make a critical appraisal of Shivaji in Maharashtra or Rana Pratap in Rajasthan. It is taboo, as students of Hyderabad Central University have repeatedly discovered, to demand that the college serve them beef. Outside metros, you periodically hear of the ABVP demanding a dress code for girls.<br/>
Lost ironies<br/>
The ABVP's obsession with its list of taboos creates hilarious situations at times. The ABVP vociferously protested against philosopher Ashok Vohra at Mohanlal Sukhadia University, Udaipur. The reason: he had addressed an audience of around 100 on The Religious Dialogue: The Need in the Contemporary Times. The ABVP claimed he had insulted Hinduism.<br/>
Vohra had done just the opposite – he had criticised western Indologists, such as Wendy Doniger. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vohra wrote,<br/>
"To evaluate theories supported by these scholars one has to use their vocabulary, their descriptions and their interpretations. I chose this because American writers speak very derogatorily of Hindu gods and goddesses… (But) if you want to rebut an argument, you must quote it."<br/>
The poor philosopher, quite clearly, missed the point. They protested against him for much the same reason as the higher castes disallow the Dalit groom to mount the mare in a wedding procession. It may not violate the principle of purity, but it certainly conveys Dalits assertion. It is possible they could feel emboldened to infringe caste rules in the future, just as a few in Vohra's audience could become intellectually curious about Doniger and learn to question the Hindu religious tradition.<br/>
In the ABVP's imagination, Mother India is dressed in the fabric of nationalism and Hinduism. To question either is to defile her. It is of little significance to the ABVP that its activists don't contest these two ideas. This is because it believes Mother India would be defiled anyway because of those who are willing to debate the taboo subjects.<br/>
The ABVP has now taken upon itself to teach them a lesson for their audacity, in much the way, the dominant castes punish the transgressor of caste codes in villages. This is why our universities are now in tumult.

                            we also pay for other universities, not the JNU alone. We also pay to the banks and to the income tax department to facilitate the banks to provide loans to big corporates (including Infosys) and smaller companies and individuals, certainly not for creating bad loans and NPAs. Universities spawn ideas.They turn students into active citizens with grand socialization of education, training, thinking and urge to participate in the nation's growth. History is not left alone with the exalted intellect of Mr. Pai to tell what is best for the students to think and which way to think. And if they must pay for their studies in case of their participation in the nation's political practice, then first ask FICCI and ASSOCHAM to put their horses together and to pay back all the bad loans and NPA, and then earn the right to think in the way he has written. Education, and free education, health and freedom of thinking and speaking are the basic entitlements and rights of the citizens and there is no denying to that only some Pais do not like the way students participate in the national politics. This comment pertains only to the issue of Mr. Pai's pain for the exchequer which he sees getting wasted on free education to the children of the country, and nothing else.

                            I am not able to understand theory of "taxpayers money/funding", is it only middle class that is paying taxes? only 2% people pay income tax. All other taxes are paid by every citizen irrespective of their income. Does our country run on taxes sole, then who takes the money extracted from natural resources like minerals and spectrum? what ever tax people like Mohandas pays, it returns to their pocket itself as subsidies to industrialists and middle class.Remaining money governments spends to provide security to you all people. Students and general people just gets the tiny of the money extracted from the natural resources on which every citizen has their part.

                            I agree with you Mr.Pai that Govt. of the day has overreacted in JNU case..There are certain aspects you said in your aricle is not at all right, for E.g, you said JNU and its faculties are of Leftist so according to you if a student, faculty or student is leftist then he/she is not a broad-minded..This is not right way to look at it Mr.Pai because we are democratic country we should be open to the ideas. Even Pandit Nehru belived in pricnciples of Socialsim and INC fought Britishers for freedom struggle along with Left parties..Mr.Narayan Murthy was also a believer of socialism before he beginning his journey in Infosys.<br/>
We should think of bringing change in the system of JNU in more appropriate way rather than making sweep comment that We fund money for studies not for politics if samething we would have said way back in 1905 when Swaraj Movement began that students have to focus on studies than politics may be we would not have free nation even today.

                            Mr.Mohandas you have now become enemy no 1 for all anti BJP parlies especially Left. WHat you have written is right. JNU had become totally anti India, pro left, pro maxist, pro nauxalite. But recently because of ABVP things have changed. Govt response can be termed as harsh but till date nobody has had the guts to take action inspite of these incidents happening regularly. And there is no difference between the these anti national students and terrorists and Rahul Gandhi or AK.RaGa has become a permanent audience in every protest happening in India as he does not have any work.

As per my personal view these political ideologies(left/communist, religion based) should be banned in educational institutions.<br/><br/>
Allowing one ideology and stopping others from expressing what they feel is Intolerance.

                            Comparing India &amp; US is wrong. A rich superpower nation providing doles to its citizen can't be compared with poor India with so many different complicated issues. People who compare India with US forget the history of US since their independence from british colonial rule. How they treated the 'dissent' the civil war. They have come a long way and which India has to travel to. No one can instigate americans to go against their nation to break it up because they know what does it mean to be american. But the same is not applicable here. Here any tom-dick &amp; harry politicians can block rail tracks, roads for months or burn train just like that to demand quota or burn police station, crate riots just because they didn't like someone's comment. Most amazing thing is when the left media, leaders[not talking about Mr. Pai] talk about 'freedom of speech' they give example of USA not of any leftist nation!!!

                            It does smell a rat. Wikipedia search shows T.V. Mohandas Pai is the Chairman of Manipal Global Education. A Chairman of a private institution in higher education is sounding foul on a Government run renowned University and talking about tax payers money. Which is absolutely a different debate. Though I fully agree with his point of view, the timing is suspect. It's purely fishing in troubled water. The issue is not restricted to the leftist ideology dominance in JNU. It is about the effort of replacement of leftist ideology dominance by right wing fundamentalist ideology. The article would have been appropriate on a different context, but today it may be taken up as a support to the right wing fanatics who are getting increasingly embolden under the present government.  The results of fundamentalists taking central stage in country's politics can be found all over the not so peaceful today's world.

                            Brilliant stuff Mr Pai! However JNU is a public institution with great national importance and of international stature. Despite its politics it has produced an outstanding alumni who have contributed to the growth of modern India. It was tax payer's money well spent. On the other hand I wonder, how much of the tax payer's money went to fund the private and for profit company in which you were working? Why was it that Infosys is unable to open shop anywhere without the benefits of SEZ facilities? How much export duty did your company not pay? How many labor laws have you violated within your precious SEZs? Why does your company not pay the fair price to the governments on land acquisitions?<br/>
I bet, by lobbying with politicians, the money you have saved by depriving the Indian exchequer is far more than the government grants that JNU receives!

                            You apparently present Rahul's behaviour as double standards with the words, "The Congress seems to have lost its moorings with its Vice President Rahul Gandhi supporting those who call the Afzal Guru hanging a judicial killing, knowing fully well that its own government executed the hanging." Actually Rahul has opposed crushing the voice of dissent which you also defend by giving the example of America, where you say "…the freedom of speech includes the freedom to burn the national flag!" In fact, among all parties in India, Congress has seen the largest number of good leaders dissenting and parting ways with it without suffering any personal or political harm. I don't think we can keep politics away from universities because of the very nature of social sciences subjects they teach. But you are right in expressing concerns about the students' and faculty's obsession with politics. All parties must form a common stand on raising the quality of education and research in the institutions of higher learning.

                            it is not only JNU, every  institution, students can take political studies but studies only. Political parties  should not be allowed to preach. See in IIT madras, getting subsidy from tax payers and using the institution to gain political recognition. Even faculty should not indulge in politics. Media should refrain from inviting such personnel.<br/>
If you sepak against India , you are not a good citizen, You can criticize the government functioning, individual but supporting the terrorist delceared by UN is totally unacceptable and you will have to pay the price for it

The larger issue  is 'do we really value   freedom of expression and   individual freedom in general ?'. The history of JNU and past misdeed of certain gentleman or regime just shouldn't count. The freedom of expression shouldn't be limited to political leaders alone. The meek citizen should enjoy the freedom. The sad part is that our journalists and media also take sides.One should always remember 1976 whenever we are in doubt about individual freedom. (also , we shouldn't be selective in applying the law. Something more serious  happens in Srinagar and it conveniently escapes the attention of Delhi)

Many of them are proud professors in top institutions. One important attribute of the institutes curriculum (unwritten)is the freedom of expression. That is being attempted to be throttled. Sad.

                            I think this article - particularly the headline - completely misunderstands the role of the academic institution in public life, especially one like the JNU whose coursework is meant to create future leaders and thinkers. All over the world, students in universities like the JNU have sparked off larger movements for justice. Student movements in Berkeley and Sorbonne in the 1960s played a key role in expanding civil rights and personal freedoms in their respective countries, Tiananmen Square in 1989 was essentially a student revolution on the political right. The role of institutions like JNU in India is the same: to ask questions to the system and bring change. <br/><br/>
For that matter, IITs and IIMs also use taxpayer money to subsidise education. A large majority of those students practice a different kind of politics - one that allows them to benefit from subsidised education and leave the country blaming "the system". Atleast the JNU students are here, and doing something about a system they don't like.

You are one person, please speak for yourself, if you are speaking as a taxpayer, every other person also has a voice in this matter. You are neither a spokesperson for the government, neither are you one for the funding public. In my opinion, we fund each and every student, period. We do not fund their education, we support them as persons, flesh and living human beings with their own thought processes, we fund them as they are the future of this world and this nation. We fund them so that their "... minds (are) without fear and their heads are held high...". We want them to lead the youth power of India with diverse opinions where "... clear stream of reason has not lost its way in the dreary desert sand of dead habit ...". This is the great tradition of the great universities of the world, modern and ancient. They admit students whom they think are worthy of those portals and let them start the journey of life work and let them be. Please let them be Mr Pai.

I certainly would like the  Taxes I pay to go to the Rural schools where it can be put to better use. The funding of Universities by Government out of the Taxes we pay has to be stopped and all higher education should be left to the Private enterprise. Of course there will be hue and cry from these free loaders to such proposals but we have just had enough of these parasites.

"Socially liberal and economically conservative" thick middle class - What an astute observation by Mohandas Pai! I wish EVERY political party understands this shift.<br/>
It is also right for no ideology to capture campuses - like Right. It is also right that if a campus is eclipsed by an ideology - like Left in most cases - it should be un-clutched ASAP.<br/>
You are right that the professors must be paid by the amount of research. <br/>
I'd also propose that the law makers and babus are paid pay rise by % of GDP rise of their electorate. 90% of Indian problems will be gloriously solved.

It is time JNU is reformed so that it works as a University and not a leftist degenerate regressive medeival coffee club.

                            Mr. Pai - Universities ARE supposed to be where every issue relevant to life and living is debated - that means politics is central. NOTHING is apolitical - not even the curriculum or institution itself. Claiming something is apolitical is a political statement. It might shock and horrify you to know that political activity on US campuses is alive and thrives...be it protests against interventionist policies, or against the Wall Street banks for collapse of the financial system and getting away with it all, or even events afar (in solidarity with Arab Spring, say). Given your esteemable knowledge of all issues in this world, I thought I should write and let you know this fact - lest someone tells you that you don't know what you are talking about. After all, you have never travelled outside India or interacted with academics in US universities, and I am SURE after you read this comment of mine, you will wisely change your views. <br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

And I sincerely hope-- to acquire his educational empire, Pai has taken absolutely no state subsidies in land allotment, electricity and other inputs!!<br/><br/>
Moreover, you are biased towards privatizing the higher education to the disadvantage of poor and rural students like me. We called your bluff.

                            Mr Mohandas Pai ... Right wing support makes a person and speak illogical.... Kindly note industries are also supported and funded by tax payers yet they are into politics... Defaulters of bank as pointed out by Rbi are many including Adani and Adag... Students cannot study with eyes closed... Free thinking should be encouraged and if you feel politics should not be a part of education system then, what is ABVP's role here ? Sadly ur speaking for the party you are aligned with than logical talks....

                            "India spends around only 2% of the GDP on education. It is even lesser than some of the poorer countries in Africa and neighbouring countries.<br/>
1. Education is a right, not a privilege. By privatizing education you are going to make it inaccessible just like health care system in India.<br/>
2. Not every one has resources backing them to go to private universities , give donations. And if you are talking about resources, then also talk of resources being systematically being drained from tribal areas and nothing given back to them. <br/>
Where are you getting your wood, coal, metals from? Delhi ya Mumbai mei toh nahi ugtaa ye sab.<br/>
3. And just because public education is paid from tax payers money you have not bought people. They can have an opinion which might not agree with your conformist view.<br/>
4. And if you have so much problem with subsidy, also have problem with government giving subsidy to private sector like writing off loans for corporates, giving away land to corporations for peanuts. Who is benefitting from this? Clearly not the masses.<br/>
Also you can clearly compare education policies in other countries who you aspire to be like - e.g US. Students are in debt for all their life because education is privatized. Students across US have been protesting against this.<br/>
But oh how will you analyze all this because you want to shut down universities !!!"<br/>
- A friend, SM, research scholar, on my Facebook.<br/>
Plus sir, they are also studying political science- not just practicing politics. The study of political science, along with other subject of the humanities and social sciences are important. People who study society come out with perspectives informing their work towards nation-building too. You see practical examples in education, policy, journalism, the development sector - to state a few, prima facie.

                            Pai is right. JNU students should be made to bear the full expenses of running the university so that any disruption comes at their cost. This includes dalit students as well. And suitable entries made in the conduct certificate of each student activist who misuses the JNU for political issues.

                            Dear Sir, very calm and composed arguments you have made. I applaud your honest and clear thinking on this matter. As an inactive student of JNU (I have taken a break from my PhD), i am glad you are asking the right questions. When i was a student there, even i wondered why are we so spectacularly subsidized and while we are, who gives us the right to indulge in politics on tax-payers money? <br/><br/>
Thank you for your incisive thoughts.

                            Well said Mr. Pai.  However, students' addiction to politics is not desirable with the present day scenerio and hence nipping such anti national activities in the name of freedom of speech is the need of the hour.  A harsh treatment is the only option to deter others from indulging in antisocial and anti national activities.  Any delay in such treatment may result in the cancer spreading all over the nation.

                            Well said Mr. Pai! But then you forget that days of privatisation and corporates are on decline in very home of US. If students will not do/learn politics in Universities then where they will harness this talent, which is needed all the time. Even in organisations, one is paid to do job but still they have to play out politics. All these you know very well. By the way with the logic of tax payers, why the hell we the citizens have to feed corrupt and criminal politicians. Though I am not sure of "anti-nationalism", but what I know there is an organisation which did not hoist Indian National Flag at thier HQ but they define "nationalism" for us.
