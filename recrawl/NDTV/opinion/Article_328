Headline::::Why AAP is Celebrating BJP's Election Results



DateTime::::2014-12-25T15:30:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)The results of the assembly elections in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir are a clear indicator that the Modi wave that resulted in massive electoral wins for the party in the Parliamentary elections is on the wane. In Jharkhand this time, the BJP was very upbeat, supported by sympathetic pollsters who calculated that the BJP would get a huge majority but the final tally is much below that mark (37 of 81 assembly seats). J&K has been a bit disappointing for the BJP and its enthusiasts. The BJP had claimed that it would get a big victory in Kashmir and would give the start its first Hindu Chief Minister. It was very confident of making inroads in the Muslim-dominated Valley. Alas! It failed miserably in the Valley and also in the Buddhist-dominated Ladakh, its strength contained to the Hindu-majority Jammu region.The most obvious question now doing the rounds in the corridors of power is what is the political message for the next battleground : Delhi.  The BJP had been banking  on the results in Jharkhand and Kashmir to create an atmosphere of invincibility, but the results clearly hint at a different story. Before analysing the impact in Delhi, we have to understand two things. Firstly, it has to be understood that Delhi will be a fight between two parties unlike in Jharkhand and in J & K., where there were multi-cornered fights and the BJP was an obvious beneficiary. In Jharkhand, the main players apart from the BJP were the Congress, the JMM , the JVM and other smaller parties with localized areas of influence. Similarly, in Jammu and Kashmir,  the BJP had to contest against the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress. The BJP therefore could create a bigger impact with narrower margins. Secondly, there is nothing new about these parties. They are traditional parties with a similar history and chemistry, and there is hardly any difference between them. And all of them behave the same way with minor aberrations. But Delhi can boast of a new party which has none of the characteristics of these traditional parties. The Aam Aadmi Party is a toddler in the game of politics; it is hardly two years old;  it is the product of an anti-corruption movement; it has an unorthodox leadership; and its behavioural patterns are very different from parties like the Congress or the BJP. It can be said without doubt that it has changed the rules of the game with its unconventional ways.It is this context which will help us understand better that the results in these two states are serious warning signals for the BJP and the Congress. These results are a bad omen for the Congress, which has been making vain announcements of bouncing back in Delhi. The people of India are not ready to forgive the Congress even now for the UPA2 misrule, and the Congress is seriously facing an existential crisis. There is a very distinct possibility that it might not open its account in Delhi. That will mean that Delhi will be a duel  between the AAP and the BJP, and the Congress a marginal player of no consequence.If the Congress shrinks further, in keeping with the signals, then it will be bad news for the BJP. In the context of a one-to-one contest, the BJP has normally been a loser. In the past 15 years, it failed miserably to give the Congress a tough fight in the Delhi elections. In these years, the BJP's vote share could not cross the critical mark to pose any serious challenge to Congress's dominance in the city. Even a marginal presence of the BSP was of no benefit to the BJP. Today, the Congress has replaced the BSP, and the BSP as a party has disappeared from the map of Delhi, which is a clear advantage to AAP.  In fact, the combined social base of the Congress and the BSP has been replaced by AAP.The counter argument can be that the BJP with its social base and the Modi factor can easily sail through. This argument does not have much bite for the following reasons:1. The Modi wave is on a decline. The BJP's performance is not as overwhelming as was envisaged in these two states. The BJP was expecting 50 plus seats in Jharkhand and wanted to emerge as the single largest party in J & K; but in Jharkhand it could barely mange a majority with the help of a smaller ally where as in Kashmir it has to be satisfied with the tag of the second largest party with 25 seats which is much below expectations. Moreover, in both the states the BJP vote share has dipped by 8% points in comparison to the parliamentary elections. The trend was the same in the recently-held assembly elections in Maharashtra where the BJP could not win a majority on its own and finally had to reconcile with its old partner, the Shiv Sena.2. Modi's governance in the last seven months has raised serious questions on the issue of delivery.  Modi raised the expectation level too high and now there is a serious gap between his assurances and delivery. His government has failed to control price rise. There is no check on corruption. The government is over-centralised. No decisions are taken on time. No major economic reform has been carried out. manufacturing sector is in shambles despite the much-hyped Make-in-India campaign. 3. The BJP in Delhi is fighting with a political force which has a much better record as a government.  In a short span of 49 days, the AAP government in Delhi was able to bring down corruption, electricity and water tarriffs. Decisions were swift and fast. AAP ministers and MLAs are spotless. None of them could be charged with corruption unlike their BJP counter-parts. Several opinion polls have shown more than 60% approval rating of AAP's government which is phenomenal.4. The BJP has serious leadership problems in Delhi. AAP has Arvind Kejriwal who commands a huge fan following in the city. The BJP has no leader match his popularity.The writing on the wall is clear. It is no wonder that the BJP has put off elections in Delhi for so long.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            WOW, this guy seems to have lost it.He said 37 out of 81.And if in case you are deducting BJP allies than deduct the total seats as well. So its 42 out of 81. Correct your stats first.And in J&amp;K, BJP got the highest vote share and increased its tally from 12 seats to 25. So i dont know if this Ashutosh is living in some Dharna world or what. By the way, in Delhi , just wait and see where your own graph goes down. You wont get even 10 seats this time. So no hurry its all wait.

                            BJP and Congress are synonymous to boyfriends and general public to a woman. She befriended with one boyfriend for a decade who turned out to be a thief in the end. And the other she got hooked-up recently his performance is not as overwhelming as was envisaged, in the last seven months has raised serious questions on the issue of delivery. For all the bravado and raising the expectation level too high and now there is a serious gap between his assurances and delivery. No wonder communal forces have taken the center stage lately and expect to only get worse as time passes by. Fasten your seat-belts we are on for a rough ride.

                            Agree with his analysis.. Even with Modiji heavy campaigning in Valley BJP couldnt even get a single seat. Ppl came out in huge numbers this time for voting, it seems it was to reject BJP in the valley. It shows wherever ppl have a credible alternative ppl are opting for that rather that. Same will be the case in Delhi where PPl have a vry credible alternative(AAP)

                            I am not one to believe in waves and tsunami of people...I also seem to think that fighting against incumbent govt by using the propaganda machinery made life easier for BJP in LS elections..The money, the micromanagement and the Media all helped create the Modi factor and BJP's significant win.<br/>
Having said that-been 6 months in to power BJP has been in news for all the wrong reasons-latest being cuts in health budget..Who does that-when nation is still reeling from Chattisgarh sterlization deaths-you would cut Health bill? So...WE ARE ALL MEANS TO GO TO RELIANCE HOSPITAL THAT YOU INAUGURATED MR MODI?<br/><br/>
AAP- is fighting for Delhi's future...They have vision and a plan..It may not be as grand as cutting health Budget to put all in right mood of celebration but they are solid plans backed by real people's feedback and real people's calculation..and not to forget clean, non criminal candidates..<br/>
I say AAP should celebrate the fact that they are trying to change the nature of politics in this country..and I think Delhi will give the majority AAP needs to implement its vision

                            Not one comment supporting the author, author's writing in fact has invoked bad comments about AAP. Author would do a lot of favour to AAP if he stops writing or speaking about AAP. Will AAP be happy if BJP is able to perform like Jharkhand or J &amp; K either as king or king maker ? Common sense says AAP should concentrate on its own performance and policies in Delhi instead which were included only in last para. The last few elections like in May and including the one where AAP got 28 seats show voters are very wise and use common sense.

Cuz you lost utterly in J&amp;K with 600+ votes and you obviously can't celebrate your performance! And if you wanted a reason to celebrate hence BJP's results.

                            He is Pappu of AAP.Whatever seats AAP can win in Delhi will go to BJP/Cong if his face is too much visible during Delhi Elections. AAP needs few terms in Opposition to become Politically stable party. It will also test their intent/seriousness/ideology to the people. 1 Year back LokPal was their only issue based on which he ran away and now there are new issues. Totally lacks any credibility.. They talk loose naming Mukhi as BJP'c CM.. That shows their immaturity.. Only time will tell whether they are just like TMC/SP/BSP or something like BJP with an ideology..

                            Dude! What Modi is doing at the center is phenomenal!.. issues like price rise, corruption, economic reforms etc. are handled by Modi in the most mature &amp; thoughtful way unlike AAP who has a knee jerk reaction to most of the issues lacking clarity and long-term thinking. Yes, manufacturing sector in India needs a complete lift-up but it cannot be turned around in just few months. Your comment "Manufacturing sector is in shambles despite the much-hyped Make-in-India campaign" holds no ground!! These campaigns are to sensitize various stake-holders and are just the initial steps. The most important factor is trust! Modi is building an environment of trust - systems, process, policies such that people, businesses and nations can find value for themselves. He is into business of serious politics which needs vision, leadership, execution, evaluation and correction - This is not a child's play!! ... the same was expected from AAP, but all AAP could deliver was nice firework - yes we clapped!! but the show got over and were back to reality... AAP lost trust! ... Will people trust AAP again? Unanswered!

                            There is stabilization of prices. Author has not given any elaboration about corruption. It is better if AAP introspects on why it was started and how it can live up to those ideals. If AAP can get honest people into political life who will not be corrupt, that in itself will be a good contribution. If it can come up with a model of urban governance, slowly it can pretty much take over badly governed cities. AAP like any movement lacks substance and has focused more on style and persona of its leader. Even JP's movement failed as it lacked content.

                            BJP and Congress are synonymous to boyfriends and general public to a woman. She befriended with one boyfriend for a decade who turned out to be a thief in the end. And the other she got hooked-up recently his performance is not as overwhelming as was envisaged, in the last seven months has raised serious questions on the issue of delivery. For all the bravado and raising the expectation level too high and now there is a serious gap between his assurances and delivery. No wonder communal forces have taken the centre stage lately and expect to only get worse as time passes by. Fasten your seat-belts we are on for a rough ride.

                            Majority in Jharkhand and 2nd place in J&amp;K is not small. <br/>
Comparing with LS? Then why AAP did not fight any of recent assembly elections when it contested 425 in LS? Whose wave is on the wane here.

Guys those who comment ...at least have some brains. Dont rush to put ' like ' on all the hate AAP comments...above 150  in short time shows its paid poor kids working. Hope someone looks into it and be more sensitive. You should pay people with brains and not just operators.

                            The Delhi elections will definitely be very interesting. I support AAP because of the fact that the Delhi BJP unit is highly corrupt and inefficient as brought out by 2 incidents. The first incident was the Sher Singh Dagar incident. Then there was the swacch bharat fiasco. On the other hand, AAP made the mistake of 49 days, but after that it has made a lot of effort to improve itself. Overall, it seems like AAP has the energy, youth, and vigor going for it, whereas BJP is still clinging to the Modi wave which is starting to look stale. I feel AAP deserves a second chance.

                            The truth is if JMM and Congress combined BJP would have been pushed to 28 seats. This means that there has been a huge setback for BJP in Jharkand. Ofcourse Bhakts cannot digest this and that can be seen in their comments here..

Also, after Kejariwals golden mistake, he may never see the throne of Delhi any more, who knows, any takers ?

                            This article is somewhat misleading. But on my own conclusion, BJP has no Agenda for Delhi. No manifesto nothing, only kept on saying development development development. It's been more than 6 months Delhi was run by BJP and have seen nothing so far. That's the reason I am not going to Vote BJP. I want some promises, a Menifesto, so that I can match it after their rule that what has been done and what's not (In case they come to power). Overusing Modi's name won't work for longer, it has already started bugging me. Delhi has an intelligent voter, hope BJP will release it Manifesto soon.

Secondly, good or bad AAP did not give opportunity to the citizens to judge their governance by stepping out in 49 days. So please stop fooling people on the name of 49 days government. We will definitely applaud if you complete your tenure with good governance in whichever state.
