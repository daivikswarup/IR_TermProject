Headline::::Why This Delhi Election Could Set a Big New Trend



DateTime::::2015-02-06T14:50:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)
	As Delhi goes to the polls tomorrow, it is hard not to think of the election campaign that has just ended in the nation's capital as intriguing evidence for the future direction of 21st century Indian politics.
	 
	For several years now, I have been arguing that the major secular trend in our contemporary politics is the shift from the politics of identity - exemplified by appeals based on religion, caste, language and sub-caste - to the politics of performance (roti, kapda aur makan at one time; today, bijli, sadak, paani; tomorrow, cheaper urban facilities and free wifi.)  Narendra Modi's victorious Lok Sabha campaign, which expanded his party's traditional vote base by augmenting its traditional Hindutva message with calls for accelerated economic development, seemed to confirm my thesis.
	 
	Yet there have always been contradictions in our country's experience. If Chandrababu Naidu exemplified a hi-tech performance-based appeal, his neighbour Chandrasekhar Rao triumphed with narrow Telengana chauvinism. If Modi argued for "sab ka saath sab ka vikas," Amit Shah embarked on systematically polarizing the electorate along religious lines in the Hindi heartland. The contrasting emphases of Nitish Kumar and Laloo Yadav, and the continued caste strangleholds of Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav suggest that identity politics is still alive and kicking across much of northern India. In UP and Bihar, it's still true that for the most part, when you cast your vote, you vote your caste.
	 
	The transformation of Indian politics has thus proceeded in fits and starts, rather than in the predictable linear curves so beloved of social scientists. Where does Delhi fit in to the narrative?
	 
	An instructive place to start would be with the election manifestoes of the three leading contenders, which is where they reveal their beliefs about what matters to the electorate. Four items are common to the manifestoes of the BJP, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress: "zero tolerance towards corruption", reduction of electricity bills, women's security, and the installation of CCTV cameras in residential colonies and in buses. The BJP and AAP also promise reduction of water rates, AAP offering 20,000 litres of free water; the Congress, with fifteen years of government behind it, makes no such unrealistic commitments. (The Congress does, however, say that if returned to power, it won't charge for sewer connections.) Electricity is a common preoccupation: while AAP simply wants to slash power bills, the BJP and Congress talk of increasing the number of power distribution companies in order to give a larger number of options to the consumers. Both BJP and Congress also promise to regularize unauthorized colonies, in the hope of weaning away their residents from AAP, who promised this explicitly last time.
	 
	On other issues, AAP promises to pass a Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill within 15 days of coming to power, an old commitment that their numbers did not allow them to fulfil during their 49 days in power, and (in another signature tune) to empower Gram Sabhas to make decisions regarding Delhi's villages. AAP has also promised to make Delhi a free wi-fi zone, also an expensive proposition but a forward-looking one. Along with the Congress, AAP also speaks of increasing the number of schools and colleges in the capital; it similarly pledges an education loan guarantee scheme. Both AAP and Congress promise full-fledged statehood to Delhi; the BJP, which runs the central Government, is less keen on the idea. Instead, the BJP promises housing for all, cleaning up the Jamuna and scrapping the unpopular BRT system. Curiously enough, it is AAP and not the BJP which makes the Modi-like promise of turning Delhi into a manufacturing hub (think of what that will do to our already unbreathable air!)
	 
	But do manifestoes tell the whole story? In many cases they are a ritual, put together for the sake of having them and ignored after the election results are declared. The political tactics of campaigners are what really matter: often, they may often have little to do with the manifestoes. Here, Delhi scores high: many of the campaign speeches explicitly focus on the commitments made in the manifestoes, and surveys by journalists and pollsters suggest that it is in the hope of their fulfilment that many Delhiites will be casting their vote.
	 
	And yet, it is too early to celebrate. Because the Delhi elections show the rise of an interesting form of identity politics: not one based on the primordial identities of religion, caste, language and sub-caste, but on the relatively unfamiliar one of class.
	 
	While the BJP continues to appeal to Hindutva-minded voters and the Congress assures Purvanchali and Northeastern migrants that it is their best protector, these identity appeals are touching only small segments of the Delhi electorate. The broader appeal is the one the Communists have been trying in vain to promote in India's democratic politics: that of the "common man", exemplified by Arvind Kejriwal in his pants, sweater and muffler (far removed from the stereotypical image of the white-khaddar-clad politician), standing up against the bastions of privilege in the name of those who have little. It is no accident that Mamata Banerjee, of the cotton sari and rubber Hawaiian chotis, has endorsed AAP and called on her fans in Delhi to vote for him. One good populist recognizes another.
	 
	In this battle, the lines are drawn against both the BJP and the Congress as paragons of the old establishment, while AAP attracts the underclass with the message that it will reduce, if not eliminate, its vulnerabilities. Since in Delhi, as everywhere else in India, the less affluent are a majority of the electorate, such an appeal to class interest has undoubted political potential. Why hasn't it worked elsewhere in India? Partly because the leaders of the underclass have themselves been seduced by the persistence of other identity loyalties; and partly because the Congress has managed, for decades, to subsume class politics into its broad socialist appeal of extending welfare benefits to the poor. In Delhi, though, the identity politics of class has found a new home amongst people who have flung many of their traditional assumptions aside in the villages they have left, and who may well be looking for a champion of their class interests, which are not so much proletarian ones as lower-middle-class. This new majority is what the AAP campaign targets.
	 
	Whatever happens when votes are cast tomorrow - and as a Congressman, let me stress that I take the news of the poll predictions with lorry-loads of salt - it's clear that a new form of identity politics is on the rise. Class politics, thought to be dying with the eclipse of the Communists in Bengal and their slow fade in Kerala, is making a comeback in Delhi. It will only work, though, if it is also linked to performance: if those who speak for a class actually deliver it the benefits they promise. In that may lie the long-term hope for India's political transformation into a 21st century democracy.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Another good article by Tharoor. A couple of weeks ago, the BJP sycophants were claiming that he would have been arrested by now. It's been a while. Haven't the police found anything remote to link him with Sunanda's murder? Stop this witchhunt. India needs a good politician like him.

                            Sir, very mediocre analysis like our secular media which does not have any credibility left. In last para, you are comparing Anticorruption movement of AAP to leftist who have destroyed India.

                            For a change, I agree with you. AAP is bringing back the class struggle and leftist agenda. The people of Delhi esp the educated one who are going crazy for AAP will suffer. Communism never worked and never will

                            Decline of the Left is one reason for the rise of BJP. If AAP could revive the Lefitist movement although  in a different form and it finds mass appeal, the diffrence between BJP and Congress would vanish, except for that Bjp is crassly communal. Yearn for garam hawa.

                            It begs the question, though : with the Congress in power for the major part of post-independent India's history, why is there still a need for a 'class' struggle? Is it because Congress leaders have been enriching themselves at the expense of the masses? Surely not!

                            Very well written and I guess something that people need to understand are the policies Left stands for. My problem with left is that they are too idealistic and sometimes impractical. However, what they want is definitely much better for the people. Development of a country is defined by the income Gap between its poor and rich (Check any developed country vs any underdeveloped).<br/>
One big vulnerability for left/AAP policies is that the process of convincing/educating illiterate masses requires money and that lies with the Rich and why would any sane rich pay you money to propagate whats not right for them :)<br/>
UK has been providing free NHS to everyone and not just the citizens isn't that being Leftist?<br/>
They give loads of freebies to their elders, isn't that being leftist?

                            AAP is the Delhi equivalent of the Greek Syriza party. It is not just a lower middle class party, but one that appeals to all middle class, who are frustrated by huge electricity and water bills. Traffic chaos and traffic jams, and parking woes, hits every citizen, irrespective of class( barring a few wealthy ones).Potholed roads, garbage and dirt, awful pollution causing the city to be the Asthma capita of India, are universal in their effect, irrespective of class. BJP has done nothing in last 9 months, and Congress is still in an electoral trauma and coma. So its AAP that will appeal to all. As far as the criticism of lack of experience, the same is true of an very inept Modi govt. Barring one or two, no minister knows what to do.

                            Impressed with the cool and relaxed format with which the writer wrote. Speaks volumes about the maturity of Tharoor who is a Congressman but this article could easily pass off as being written by anyone loyal doing a balanced study.(Note my praise is for this individual and not his party). This cool and relaxed format is also needed for intellectual debate. This clearly contrasts with the style of BJP (whose leaders and fans) are seldom found to be talking in anything but extreme nouns and adjectives laced with hatred and often with an air of know-it-alls. Except the really die-hard fans of BJP who are more driven by its ideology, the rest - the huge bulge of normal moderate supporters of BJP - driven by the positive agenda, this aspect of extreme talk is a major turnoff. The sooner the BJP realises this the better. For all hullabaloo over the Modi wave of 2014 election, the humbling reality (but boring for the media stories) is this was above all a vote against the politics of Congress rule and not really a support for any other agenda, party or individual. Kejriwal's ascendence is as much to do with Delhi or AAP as it is to do with the basic reality that BJP is not perfect and after the Congress is gone, BJP can't just continue to ride anti-congress wave. BJP and Modi need to get humble and get to work for the nation. Words and speeches alone can stretch the first year but no more. They have more than 4 years left and people have a lot of expectations. Best of luck to everyone.

                            Whatever is the analysis by the expert, one plus point for BJP is the candidature of Ms Kiron Bedi as CM. This is a greatest appeal for 'Aam Aadami' of Delhi, which will decide the election outcome.

                            AAP identifies itself as anti corrupt and anti criminal political party.Apart from the dharnas which every party does,its unfair to compare it to the left.Mark my words-the day aap aligns or identifies itself with the left parties or left ideology,that is the day which will lead to its downfall.For left is polarizing too-some people like me and am sure many others view it as nothing short of disastarous and disgisting.

                            I think some people are confused. Isn't it purely judge mental to believe that socialistic approach in given free water to the underprivileged will do no good. Water is a basic necessity. It's not like wifi. Aap has an issue based approach devoid of any ideological affiliation. we surely have seen the left right n the liberals.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor,<br/><br/>
You are very right in pointing out that the politics is changing and eventually and hopefully, it will dissociate from the basis of caste, religion, race etc. and will be able to focus on the class and the real division in the society and the biggest struggle of governance. I am not a believer in communism but yet I would like to challenge the capitalist (market, profit, consumer based) way of the world. It would be ideal to strive for creating governing models with which we can think of the problems ahead and find best solutions to ones we have on our hands. Sometimes these solutions are inversely proportional to each other and there lies the biggest challenge for every government. <br/><br/>
There are still a few issues that nobody considers in India which is the rise of population and in turn the pollution. From this perspective, we have a very short time to react and if we cannot find solutions promptly, it could all lead to a disaster. No where on this planet is the space so limited for the people of the geographical state. The current and previous solutions seemed to have an inkling of symptomatic and quick remedies which create other problems.<br/><br/>
Finally, I would like to point out that there is one clear mistake in your article which is about AAP's agenda. They have mentioned to create Delhi as an educational/institutional hub and not a manufacturing hub. Being abroad, I am unable to vote in tomorrow's Delhi elections but I hope that there will be a big turnout.<br/><br/>
Thank You.

Also elaborate on the role the Church plays in influencing the voters, in Kerala or outside of it. Everybody agrees on the rights of people to call their Municipal corporations and ask for cleaner towns and villages, around Delhi as well, they don't really know whom to approach for noise pollution, and other related fallouts of technical advancement.

                            "Class politics, thought to be dying with the eclipse of the Communists in Bengal and their slow fade in Kerala, is making a comeback in Delhi" writes Shashi Tharoor.  What seems to be happening in Delhi as well as elsewhere is not a return of the "class politics" - if it was there at all - but a slow transition from identity politics to interest-group politics.  The challenge before liberal democrats and the two major parties (Congress and BJP) is how to ensure that the inevitable conflict between interests of different groups are reconciled democratically.

                            Mr Tharoor is afraid of truth coming out in BJP regime which was covered up in Congress , his party regime. As it is very certain Congress not coming to power , hence, he has apprehended atleast Communist come to Power since Communist can<br/>
be bargained as they did till N-deal settled. Yethuri was instrumental in raising public issue like hike in petrol, diesel prices, etc., but as he got compensation in bargain he him self rolled back instead Govt. rolled back the hike. Tharoor dreams  if such a party comes to power he can manage Delhi show with enormous wealth at his disposal . Creating drama in Delhi, will effect Central Govt. &amp; as aresult shift attention from his case of murder to State political problems. Good imagination but Mungerilal ke Sapne

                            Im sure as the number of 1st time voters reduces and a more matured voter base emerges, wiser voting will take place and the current cult based elections wont work. This is a prediction assuming the fact that the growing educated/working class understand that religion/caste based voting will not benefit to bridge the gap between the rich and poor.A developed(Super power) nation is the one in which the gap between the two is blurred.

                            AAP does seem to have taken inspiration from the Communists. Even the name of the party suggests this. When Prashant Bhushan of AAP had visited Kerala several months ago, he had praised the opposition leader V.S.Achuthanandan of the CPM. This goes to show that AAP does have left leaning tendencies. Let us hope that if they come to power, they don't behave in the same destructive way as the commies in West Bengal and Kerala have done.
