Headline::::Vajpayee was Victim of Congress Churlishness



DateTime::::2014-12-24T20:35:00+05:30



(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi)In awarding Atal Bihari Vajpayee the Bharat Ratna, the NDA government has acted wisely and correctly. In fact, it has done something the UPA was repeatedly advised to do but was too small-minded in its decade in power (2004-14) to actually accomplish. The very fact that Vajpayee has been honoured with India's highest civilian honour while he is still us, albeit retired and ailing, is a blessing. Non-Congress and non-family politicians have had to wait till well after they have died, sometimes decades after they have passed on, to be so honoured.Vallabhbhai Patel was awarded the Bharat Ratna four decades after he died, and only after a non-Gandhi, PV Narasimha Rao, took charge as Prime Minister. BR Ambedkar and Jayaprakash Narayan were named for the Bharat Ratna not just decades after they had died, but also only after non-Congress governments had come to office. Morarji Desai was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1991, 12 years after he ceased to be Prime Minister. In the same year Rajiv Gandhi was given the honour, weeks after his assassination. His mother, Indira Gandhi, and grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, had been awarded the Bharat Ratna in their lifetimes, while serving in the Prime Ministry.Vajpayee has a lot in common with the stalwarts named above and yet he is different. Unlike many of the other political figures who have been awarded the Bharat Ratna, he comes from an entirely non-Congress tradition (as indeed do the Communists) and it is important to acknowledge the achievers and leading lights of these alternative streams of Indian politics and political philosophy. At a more mundane level - if that expression can be used at all in the context of the Bharat Ratna - Vajpayee will go down as one of India's finest Prime Ministers. He laid the foundations of the decade-long economic boom, the fruits of which became apparent during the early years of the UPA government. Vajpayee's government had done the hard work, whether on telecom reform, power sector revamp, highway building or triggering a housing surge. He left the successor government with an enviable legacy, including a very manageable fiscal deficit, and with the hope of a genuine Indian economic renaissance.Vajpayee's other big achievement was in foreign policy. Among his first actions as Prime Minister in 1998 was to give permission for the Pokhran nuclear tests - building on foundations laid by at least three previous Congress Prime Ministers. It was an ambitious dare, a means of ending India's nuclear apartheid and reorienting its foreign policy. It paid off; indeed, the nuclear deal Manmohan Singh brought home in July 2005 was a logical culmination of the Pokhran II tests and the diplomatic energies they unleashed.Perceptions are shaped by the framework in which they occur. When his party was voted out in May 2004, there was widespread admiration and sympathy for Vajpayee and he was seen as a good Prime Minister. It took a decade of under-achieving and wishy-washy leadership during the Manmohan Singh government to drive home the message that Vajpayee was not just a good Prime Minister but a great one.He wasn't perfect - nobody is - but did more for his country and for future generations in six years than most other Prime Ministers, including at least one who served several terms.History will judge him well, even if the UPA government was (and Congress groupies remain) too churlish to do so.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I really like Ashok Malik's observation. Conggiis -I mean here Nehru clan - are so little minded and so undemocratic that they ignored many stalwarts of India for keeping their family going. I think one dictator family we know Nehrus has been vermin for this country. We Indians living abroad strongly condemn this family and there is no place in modern democracy for family politics. They should be kept out of our countries politics if India wants to claim to be democratic country and not run by dictator Nehru family.

                            This is the fact of India. May be congress people will not accept, but it is absolutely correct, that the foundation stone of economical development was laid by Mr. Vajpayee. He made country self dependent by doing Nuclear test. After test there were sanctions all across world, but he made country stand on its feet. afterwards all came to India. This is foundation.

                            PVNR rose above narrow political considerations and ensured that the all the hard work he put in to make India nuclear capable is passed on to his successor. Is this country not churlish in not recognizing the way he transformed this country from a socialist economy to market friendly economy without feeling the pain of such massive structural changes? Is the country not churlish in not recognizing his wisdom and astuteness in managing the post cold war Indian diplomacy? Is this country not churlish in not recognizing his deft handling of Punjab and Kashmir crisis which prevented second partition of India. The list goes on. One can not reach Vajpayee days without reminiscing the achievements of PVNR. He paid price not because he is less patriotic and had less achievements compared to any BR awardee, but  for surviving for five years as P.M. without a politically acceptable social background.

                            Modi sir, please also give this honor out Late PM P.V.Narasimha Rao. He is the one who got the financially about to fall India to a position by strongly supporting MMS who is a Financial Minister where most of the reforms made and most important P.V.N.Rao kept Gandhi family distant from Delhi. Due to that only he didn't get a ghat in Delhi.<br/><br/>
Some people can ask he is responsible for Babri issue, even Godra Riots happened during Atalji. P.V.N.Rao gave the baton to Atalji and he carried very well.<br/><br/>
In my personal opinion , P.V.N.Rao deserves Bharat Ratna.

                            My history books (prepared by pseudo secular parties) never taught about Mr. Malaviya. Today when I read article which says many prominent freedom fighters including Gandhiji considered Mr.Malavia as his Guru, I am astonished. The true colors of Congress is shown by changing history as per their needs.

                            Congress thinks that all goodness belonged only to Nehru Gandhi family and it's leaders. And whatever is  first right that's firstly for Congress. So, All Bharat Ratna Awards should have been put safe for Robert Vadhera, Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and rest of some for Muslim cleric and some for political purposes.

                            How suddenly Mr.Ashok Malik has become so wise that he is attributing motives to the wisdom of congress/UPA in awarding awards? Mr.Malick's anti congress approach is not unknown to common man and his undue inclination towards BJP is also not. While appreciating Vajpayee's regime so vociferously he conveniently forgets to mention the horrifying events that took place in the vajpayee's regime which includes Kargil,Kandhar and attack on parliament which makes that regime totally black and unpopular still Mr. Malick chose to ignore such a shamfull events of Vajpayee regime which  shows that he is suffering from selective amnesia and I think this is the reason that his opinion on political analysis is not considered wise enough and fair.I do not subscribe to his views which are based more on hatred than on fact.

                            Nehru, Indira and Rajiv have been awarded the Bharat Ratna. Sonia and Rahul too deserve the award for great service to the country , as it is because of their regime that the country has been rid of Congress rule at the center.

                            First and foremost Mr Vajpayee getting the Bharat Ratna is good and congratulations to him. Now let's make some facts clear about Mr Malik's observations <br/><br/>
1) He is a BJP supporter and his views are in sync with the BJP and RSS <br/>
2) Now getting into some of his observations, the nuclear test. It is none other than Mr Vajpayee who has told that it was PV Rao's government which had done the initial hard work for the bomb and when he was leaving his office, Mr Rao had slipped a handwritten note to him, requesting not to stop this test. The good thing Vajpayee did was continue with that  and keep it a total secret, even Mr Advani new it only at the time of the blast<br/>
3) Please do not talk about the foreign policy aspect. No amount of shouting your lungs out would stop people from talking about the utter disaster what happened when Mr Musharraf was here and how he went to talk to Mr Advani superseding Mr Vajpayee. Then we all know about the Kargil planning which happened behind the scene, when Mr Vajpayee was talking to Mr Sheriff, In Pakistan <br/>
4) Please do not talk about the legacy which Mr Vajpayee left for the next government. He got a well carved policy shaped by the then finance Minister Mr Manmohan and the Prime Minister Mr Rao. All indicators, GDP, BOP, Inflation were well set and even the Telecom policy was clear ( please remember the contribution of Mr Sam P) and what Mr Vajpayee did was follow it through. Where he failed miserably was, while believing the India Shining Campaign, he did not know the distress of the farmers and the amount of suicides which were happening. That was his waterloo, while the BJP did good in Metros it failed miserably in our villages. Please check the data. And again what the BJP government got as GDP growth was one of the best GDP% across the world, and yes the inflation was high <br/>
5) Last but not the least lets also talk about the different power centers which were there. One led by Mr Advani who was constantly eyeing the chair and squeezed himself to a deputy PM, then let's talk about the all-powerful Brijesh Mishra and again Mr Vajpayee's son in Law who was handling a parallel PMO Office<br/><br/>
While the present BJP talks about reforms it does not have the intellectual capacity to think out of the box for the next generations of reforms. All what we hear is Make in India Campaign but the "How" is missing. We hear about Swatch Bharat Campaign, but the How is missing. <br/>
	We successfully with stood the financial Tsunami of 2008 because of one amongst the several Programme called MNREGA, and the amount of Money it brought to the rural economy which had a bottom up impact to the country. Look at the net decrease it caused on the mobile phone rates which were sky high during Mr Vajpayee's period. For all this you need intellectuals like Mr Manmohan, Mr Chidambaram, The NAC, the planning commission etc. God save the country if a 2008 has to re occur, because we have people who will just advertise that India is shining, while the Indians would be Burning. Jai Hind

                            I completely agree with @Mavrick, P V Narasimha Rao does deserve the Bharat Ratna! Only blemish was the massive TV campaign launched by him towards the end of his tenure as PM, which was expressly communal and misuse of Doordarshan network!

                            Congiis work for Nehru family and "high command ".Not for country . And the most unfortunate thing is they don't do anything and criticize others . Congress should be wiped out from india . people of india should not vote for them just for the credit of participation in independence struggle . It's so disappointing tht for the last 10 years , army was not supplied with necessary boots , goggles, gloves rifles . The rafale deal is snailing slower than snail .

                            Mr Malik should stop adoring BJP and start thinking above the prestige associated with Bharat Ratana. Such an award to a person who was complete failure in getting Indo-Pak accord sign. He misread Pak that lead to Kargil war and changed his opinion about daddu (NaMo)for 2002 riots. Not only that by testing nuclear bomb had made Pak as well nuclear. He was good opposition leader and average performer in governance. I don't agree with Bharat Ratna to Atal.

                            Vajpayee indeed deserves and its good of NDA for doing it on Vajyapee's birthday.  On the same note, Dr.Manmohan Singh too deserves Bharat Ratna award for having held various high offices, being an excellent FM during Narasimha Raos's Govt and quite good PM during UPA I regime.  Only during UPAII regime his name &amp; fame diminished not because of his efficiency its all due to high handedness of Sonia &amp; Rahul and various inefficient &amp; highly corrupt Congress Ministers. But for his UPAII regime failure his past excellent track record should not be forgotten.
