Headline::::Kejriwal's Paranoia Reaches Indira Gandhi Levels



DateTime::::2015-05-18T15:48:00+05:30




                                In Delhi, there is a war raging between the elected Government and the Lieutenant Governor (LG). A war about the appointing of an Acting Chief Secretary for a period of 10 days, while the current incumbent is on leave. Would you believe it? Why is so much energy being wasted on such a temporary posting? Why does it matter so much to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that he is publicly discrediting the officer in question, Shakuntala Gamlin, as someone "close to power companies",  and attacking the LG for breaching constitutional norms by not following the government's recommendations.
Why is there so much sound and fury over what seems a trivial issue? Or is there a larger game afoot?
One could argue that this battle over this minor appointment is actually part of the greater tussle that Mr Kejriwal has been having with the Centre about how Delhi's dyarchial system of government should work. Unlike states that have full statehood, Delhi is a Union Territory where powers are divided between the LG acting on behalf of the central Government, and the elected state government. So key powers such as Law and Order and appointments are under the LG. And this has been an issue with Mr Kejriwal since he came to power. He has demanded consultation on the appointment and transfer of police officers, has asked the Secretariat (government headquarters) not to send files to the LG, and variously sought to change the equation between his office and that of the LG. As the LG has resisted, the conflict has lingered and the latest attack can be seen in the context of Mr Kejriwal trying to lay down the norms for future appointments. He has already got support from the Congress, the CPM and Omar Abdullah on this. But did he needed to publicly defame an officer who does not have the right to reply to gain this ground? Not really, but then that is Mr Kejriwal's style: attack people mercilessly and often with flimsy or no evidence and accuse them of corruption so as to win public support.
And that is what the real battle is for: public support. Mr Kejriwal knows that three months after being in power, the love and affection of the Delhi voter for him has fallen a considerable few notches To many, AAP rule in Delhi has been one of giveaways and of conflict.
So we are supposed to be getting 20,000 litres of water free, but since the meters are faulty or don't work, and billing is erratic, nobody really knows what is going on. But this promise by AAP seems to be delivered. Similarly, people using less than 400 units of electricity a month are getting an enhanced subsidy. And this has come without too many power cuts. Mr Kejriwal claims that corruption is down 70-80 percent. His daughter can testify to that - she tried to bribe an officer at the transport department and failed.
The anti-corruption hotline is up and running, and in just over a month, the government claims to have received 1.4 lakh complaints. That's 3,000 complaints a day. If that volume is reliable, every corrupt officer in Delhi should have been in jail by now. But hyperbole is an acceptable political weapon, and catering to one's constituencies is a given of politics.
So, auto-rickshaw drivers, who, according to Kejriwal, helped AAP win, have been given license to do whatever they want: refuse passengers trips and generally behave as a law onto themselves. And teachers have been encouraged to teach vipassana (meditation) and the government will fund vipassana trips for them. Just like they did for Mr Kejriwal and his family's short residence in Bangalore after he was elected.
These are simple giveaways that do not require much governance. But on issues that require more thought,  the Government seems to be without any direction. AAP alleges that Ms Gamlin, the Acting Chief Secretary and Power Secretary, asked the Power Minister to sign a comfort letter for a loan for BSES, one of the companies that supplies power in the capital. As a 49 per cent shareholder in the company, the Delhi Government has previously (as confirmed by former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit) signed such letters. To accuse someone of being "close to power companies" on this ground seems odd; but more importantly, if the lack of the letter stops the loan, where will the money come from to pay companies that supply power to Delhi? And if those firms are not paid, they will cut off power to Delhi. And then who will Mr Kejriwal blame? Bureaucrats, the central government or the power companies?
Prior to the war with the LG's office, AAP was at war with itself as Mr Kejriwal sought to oust the two people within the party that had the stature to argue with him. The battle was not about Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan acting against AAP, but about their daring to question Mr Kejriwal. Like most Indian political leaders, Mr Kejriwal sees himself as infallible, and someone who must be obeyed. So under the garb of being humble lies a man who has systematically eliminated his rivals from his sphere - earlier victims arguably include Anna and Kiran Bedi.
But Mr Kejriwal's paranoia does not end with those within. From the heady days of the Ram Lila Ground where the anti-corruption movement hit its peak to early 2015, the media and Kejriwal seemed to enjoy a love fest. The media lost its neutrality in providing extraordinary coverage to Kejriwal and Co. ahead of the Delhi election, while AAP made sure the media got a supply of catchy soundbites. Unfortunately (for AAP), the media's love is transient. As AAP brought the aaya rams (questionable candidates) into the party for the elections, there was a realisation that these guys were just like the other guys - anything to win a few more seats. Pity that, because the AAP would have swept Delhi without those 'converts' from the mainline parties. But the scales had fallen and the media was more questioning. The media swing was too late to sway people, but AAP remembered this and as party leader Ashutosh pointed out on ndtv.com, five channels (he has some scientific basis for this, no doubt ) were against them in the election.
After AAP came into power, the media was first locked out of the Secretariat, so that it would not have access to bureaucrats; then it was pilloried for its 'lynching' of the Law Minister (over allegations of a fake degree), and finally, the media was threatened with criminal defamation. The paranoia reached Indira Gandhi levels when the Delhi government set up a channel-monitoring centre to catch and then punish errant and no doubt deviant media behavior.
So is AAP creating these warlike situations to distract people from the reality of little governance, or is it unable to change its spots?
If it is the former, then this government is struggling to come to grips with administration and policy and being so unable, is creating a 'warlike' situation so that it can tell its constituents, "See everyone is stopping us from doing what is good for you". It is not a bad strategy when you are groping for an understanding of how to handle the levers of powers. There will be enough people who will buy the argument that despite internal enemies, the centre and a paid media against him, Mr Kejriwal is trying his best.
The other option is more worrying. Is it possible that someone who has spent so long leading the flag of agitation finds it difficult to jump off that horse and onto another one that provides governance? The agitator syndrome?  Where agitation is not just a means to an end but an end in itself.
Somewhere in all this is a confused administration with few policy ideas, who find it easier to battle the windmills in their minds than the realities of everyday governance.

                            AAP has become laughing stock and mockery in the eyes of world. AAP finds everything around them corrupt, murky and gloomy except behaviour of its own Members. Delhi People must be repenting of having voted for AAP, but now they will have to bear with this Drama Company for next 4 year and some more months.

                            AK is not doing much other than the area where he is strong (questioning others). I saw that he offered free elec and water quickly. And see that there is a helpdesk to complain wherever there is Corruption. Both are good if implemented well. There is no other siginificant progress anywhere else. BUt he is in news for other item like trying to split Congress to get to power, throwing some seniors out of party, alleging media about taking Supari to crush AAP etc. He needs to come back and do some good. Else it will be back to COngress in Delhi.

                            An excellent summing up! Kejriwal has been tilting at windmills and continues to do so  as he clearly perceives that he cannot administer Delhi as he ought to and this is the only way left to keep his Delhi voters with him. As he has no compunction in uttering blatant untruths and terminological inexactitudes from public platforms and has not suffered any ill effects yet from this nasty behaviour, he is encouraged to repeat such outrageous acts. He will pay a steep price for all this before long.  He is reported to be going to the President next with his tale of woe and complaints against all and sundry. What if the President does not oblige him? Will he add the President also to the long list of people,parties and authorities that are determined to "prevent Kejriwal and AAP from governing Delhi properly", as he seems to imagine?

                            One only need look at the demeanour of arch lieutenants such as the sinister Sanjay Singh and the slimy Sissodia to get a measure of AAP and Kejriwal.  These three characters have a faithful lap-dog Ashutosh wagging his tail and concocting all sorts of rubbish in support of his masters.  I would suggest that the power companies and water companies do, indeed cut off supplies so that the people of Delhi realise what sort of idiotic character they have elected.  When the Bihari slum dwellers are promised the world for nothing in return, they are bound to vote for Kejriwal.  When nothing is delivered, they will try a more credible candidate.

                            AK a demagogue of the worst order. He is crafted with the ability to fool people. He uses people to suit his own political and personal ambition.<br/><br/>
He climbed on the shoulders of PB,SB,YY and the professor to reach where he is but once they were detrimental to his self-interested discarded, like the Professor now says discarded like sanitary napkins. <br/><br/>
AK does not even blink to shed his claimed ideology be it starting with dharna over Delhi police when his stated ideology was investigative independence (CBI), he has a case in the supreme court for decriminalisation of defamation charges but now that a lot of media is getting unfriendly sees it fit to take them to court.<br/>
As the writer points out he is becoming more like Indira, AK is dangerous to the country, the sooner the people of Delhi and his sycophants realise it the better it is. Note that Modi was hounded by Rajdeep and his wife for years since 2002, but they are still free and Modi never considered bringing in new laws or ways of controlling media ever since he became PM. The greatness of the leader is to look how he treats the losers, the way AK has treated YY,PB,SB and the lokpal-respecable Admiral is a wake up call for all people believing in democracy.<br/>
AK IS A DICTATOR IN THE MAKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                            NDTV after a long time you have come out with an objective story albeit you didn't have the guts to do it openly rather in column even that is granted. Mr Bajpai has straight away gone into the malaise called Kejriwal and it's symptoms . This man is apt at character assassination of his supposed enemies . To me he and Sisodia look the classy characters from the famous novel by Cervantes with Sisodia being the Sancho Panza they can discover enemies out of nowhere and their fears for attack are as flawed as that of George W Bush aka the discovery of WMDs in Iraq . The only casualty in this beside the Indian polity is the innocent population of Delhi who has to bear these thugs for five years

                            Good note on whats happening with AAP and its leader Mr. Kejriwal. I hope message in the article is taken without AAP volunteers and leaders jumping at conspiracy theory. Key message is "lets govern". Yes, Delhi being not fully functional state is an issue which earlier CMs have raised as well. But such larger issue will take time to resolve. And this can't be the first item on a new government agenda. It has to start as basic issue  from water, electricity and so on. I am sure promise to delhi was made basis knowing these constraints. AAP did manage to start on some of these issues but seems to take it further either given challenge or just don't know what to do? But this is no reason to keep agigating and not governing.

                            The Animal Farm by George Orwell is being staged in Delhi. Anna Hazare owes an apology to the people of Delhi for marketing an anarchist for a Gandhian. Investigative journalists would be failing the country if they don't expose the real game of the hidden foreign hand to increase their attack on Narendra Modi through Arvind Kejriwal, whom they will use to create chaos and total anarchy on Delhi streets. Prime Minister Modi has frustrated their designs for one full year and they are unable to digestthe game being played in Delhi would need a deft handling. Let Arvind Kejriwal meet the President- in all likelihood he is going to repeat his sentiments for the LG for the President too! Watch it.

                            Very biased opinion. Please write your opinions on facts and ensure it is not biased.

                            Buddy, you have missed the donation scam and 14 day Govt. On balance you have covered everything that a BJP spokes person should(as per their check list!)!<br/>
For rest of the sane people, Change can only be brought about by disruption of status quo. If it needs to be done this way so be it. Since when has AK been scared of a showdown?

                            It's hard to digest that a person who is a journalist for last 30 years and  working in a renowned media house is posting biased articles and has a very little knowledge of law. Please go through article 239AA clause 4. This is the reason why media is losing it's credibility.

                            The voters in Delhi must be hoping that AK quits again over some pretext and they will be spared this daily Nautanki! The man is not fit to be in politics. His manipulative style and dictatorial penchant are clear signals that AK is a disaster for Delhi/india

                            one of the utterly biased articles that I have read, did not expect this from an experienced journalist who claims to have seen it all. LOL.

                            Not sure if anyone knows what good governance is - if it is to maintain status quo ie all the societal chasms intact then we have had bucketfuls for 60+ years!if it is to improve the lot of the vulnerable then really where is it? Neither congress or the BJP came with administrative experience and have continued with archaic colonial constructs there to divide &amp; rule. AAP is an experiment in the alternative - so there will be a few odd bangs - stick with it as the old system has not really improved corruption, cast ism, religious divide, poverty or anything else. Let's not be dazzled by the riches of the few - listen hard to the whimpering of the multitude

                            Kejri realised that he is most powerless CM in the whole country. Delhi is a just glorified Muncipality.
