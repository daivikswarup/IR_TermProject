Headline::::JNU Time Travels To The Days Of Emergency



DateTime::::2016-02-15T15:28:00+05:30




                                JNU has been a lifeline for me and a reason for my existence. Therefore, I was shocked when I heard the news about JNU being branded a den of terrorists and combed by the Delhi Police in search of arms and ammunition. What further compounded my worry was the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar, the students union president, on charges of sedition. I was both depressed and livid. I made a few phone calls and came to know that although anti-India slogans had been raised, there was no evidence of Kanhaiya's participation in that. When I heard his speech on social media, I was convinced of this.
Kanhaiya reminded me of the old JNU where students and faculty used to take a lot of pride in their intellectual richness and concern for the down-trodden. Student leaders tat JNU were unlike leaders from other universities. They were intellectuals in their own right, had 360-degree knowledge about world history and society. When I joined JNU, Sachin Tendulkar was not a national sensation and Sunil Gavaskar was still the icon of millions. Marxism-Leninism was still in vogue despite the birth of Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Soviet Union and his glasnost and perestroika to reform the Soviet system from within. China was not a super power and rated a poor country. Mao was still alive.
With all this, the JNU campus reverberated with discussions about politics in far-flung areas like Cuba and Nicaragua. This was when there were no mobile phones. Computers were a distant dream. India was a mixed economy and "open market" was bad language. The world had still not turned into a global village.
The day I joined JNU, I came face-to-face with a cafeteria worker speaking in English and a group of girls who were openly smoking cigarettes. I was nervous when they shook hands with me. I still remember when I was invited to visit Nirula's for the very first time. I was left speechless when I saw "hot dog" on the menu. I had never eaten anything like that and wondered for a long time how to eat it and if it was dog meat. For the first time in my life, I met students from other parts of the country. Most of them were very fluent in English; those who could not speak English suffered from an inferiority complex. Female students used to frequent boys' hostels without any hesitation. Young men and women were to be found together on the Parthasarthi Rocks and dhabas post midnight.
It was all a big cultural shock for a boy like me from Mirzapur. Within a week, I wrote to my father that I didn't think I would survive there. But I survived for eight years, did my MA and MPhil, and was registered for a PhD when the journalism bug bit me. Today, after a successful stint as a journalist for more than two decades, I am part of a political revolution called AAP. I take a lot of pride that I studied in the most intellectually-superior institute in India. It was JNU that taught me to respect the right to articulate someone's viewpoints despite disagreeing with their thoughts. JNU had a tradition of post-dinner public speeches by guest speakers, mostly in a hostel mess. Everybody was welcome. The only time a speaker was not allowed to speak was when Sitaram Yachury tried to defend the massacre of students at Tiananmen Square by the Chinese army. He was to speak in the Periyar Hostel mess. As soon as he said that not a drop of blood was shed on Tiananmen Square, students booed him out.
After this episode, a large part of the cadre deserted SFI, the student wing of CPM. SFI was the most dominant student party but Tiananmen Square weakened the SFI permanently. The disillusionment with SFI gave way to a more militant left organisation called AISA, the student wing of theÂ  CPI(ML). There were other fringe Left organisations, but they were never powerful enough to dominate the intellectual space. The Left does talk about violent overthrow of regimes. The Soviet and Chinese revolutions were violent in nature unlike India, which under the leadership of Gandhiji, did not subscribe to violence as a means of political change. And at JNU, violence was anathema. Anyone indulging in violence was subjected to social ostracism.
In my own hostel, the Periyar Hostel, when a group of students beat up a fellow student, the late-night general body meeting decided to socially boycott them, a call which was adhered to by each and every resident. JNU was a unique place where Marxism made truce with non-violence. Unlike other campuses, women were absolutely safe. They could walk in the most secluded places on campus without being teased, harassed, and harmed. Gender equality and gender security were the greatest boons any educational institution could offer in those days, and I am told that that tradition still continues. Religious bigotry had no place, and intolerance was a word we never heard. Nationalism was very radically debated in public life but nobody questioned anybody's patriotism.
There is no denying the fact that there were a few radical elements espousing the cause of Kashmir's independence or the secession of some North Eastern states. But in my long stay in the campus, I never heard any anti-India slogan even through heated discussions on the issues of referendum and right of self-determination. The RSS and its politics of right-wing Hindutva were firmly rejected. The ABVP was non-existent. They were considered regressive. So were those who talked about radical Islam. It was a campus which was secular to the core.
Today, an attempt is being made to paint JNU in a bad light, to discredit its reputation. This probably is the most serious attack on JNU after the raid by Mrs Gandhi's goons during the Emergency, but I am sure this, too, shall pass, though the scars shall remain. The JNU culture will survive. It was this culture which gave confidence to a boy whose mother earns Rs. 3000 per month to contest elections and become the JNUSU president. When I heard Kanhaiya's speech, I felt proud.
Those who are trying to insult the institution will one day feel sorry and isolated. That day is not far.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I am a supporter of AAP and Arvind Kejriwal .But sad to say  that you are taking wrong stand and supporting Anti National and Anti social element. You want to play minority vote bank .But you are losing votes of patriotic Indians . You may have sympathy for Anti BJP people and you are entitled for that, but they were shouting anti India slogan not anti BJP slogan. Nobody can tolerate such anti national. I think BJP government should take strict and swift action . I am s AAP supporter but completely against you on this issue. I am not a BJP troll you can check that I have donated more than 10 times . So for sack of AAP and country do not play in the hands of Anti National people

                            I think left ideology is full of hatred towards religion, rich people, system and basically anything which works as a system. They are basically anarchist,crybaby and always play the victim card. They have caused more violence than any other ideology. It is a failure and should be reformed to the core.

                            will Arvind Kejriwal now onwards stop saying after his speeches " Bharat Mata ki Jai" or Jai Hind after every FM advertisement.<br/><br/>
Don't you have shame. We don't have problems with JNU as an institution but this is also fact that there are some Anti National students there and they need to be weeded out. Don't mix the issues. Police went there to arrest students who they find figure on video clipping broadcast on major TV channels. where is the question of arms and ammunition ?

                            It's amazing to see race of articles to support this anti national students. Just for political gains, this political writers forgot that entire India is watching  and will decide whether "raising anti india slogans" is acceptable or "arresting a anti social activist"

                            "It was this culture which gave confidence to a boy whose mother earns Rs. 3000 per month to contest elections and become the JNUSU president", but no mother can be proud that her son is involving/supporting anti-national movements. Yes, people have their own opinion between capital punishment and lifetime imprisonment, but it is not a right way to oppose capital punishment by supporting terrorists like Yakoob Menon, Afzal Guru and saying "Jitne Afzal maroge, har ghar se afzal niklega". This way one not only opposes capital punishment, but also supports terrorism, which India will never ever tolerate.

                            Speechless!! I had never thought that so many people across the board would stand with anti national elements. I have seen people are writing, this is freedom of speech we are with. Amazing!! freedom also has some limits. NO ONE stopped them from demonstrating but look at them whey they are demonstrating, IN SOLIDARITY with 'Afzal Guru'. On top of they are saying anti India slogans. Had it been any other country, these type of anti national activities would have been handled with might.

                            Mr Ashutosh, <br/><br/>
you may need to relook your timeline! If you joined JNU when Gorbachev came to power in the USSR, Mao would certainly have not been alive. He died nearly a decade prior to that.<br/><br/>
China's economic reforms also started a few years after he died.

                            The claim "the most intellectually-superior institute in India" is factually wrong. This maybe true from his personal point of view, need not be that of all.This is like " Frog in the Well" view of the world.There are many more Institutes in other states(Karnataka,Maharashtra,WB,TN,Kerala,Punjab,Odisha etc.etc) of India which are superior to JNU. Please shed the superiority complex.The point here is different.JNU students are indeed lucky to enjoy highly subsidised facilities(Room Rent only Rs11/- pm, Fee of only Rs219/- per year etc.). After enjoying all these out of hard working INDIAN Tax Payers' sweat and blood, indulging in Anti-India, Pro-Pakistan Slogans is highly condemnable. The nation should stand together, setting aside Political Ideologies in condemning these acts and support the Government of the day to take strictest actions. This should be a lesson to all those "Progressive Intellectuals", who enjoy all GOVT of INDIA's benefits, accommodations and subsides but create discord and disharmony in colleges and society. Also, many "Intellects" remain students for 20 to 25 years at a stretch, like they join at age of 20 years and remain on rolls as students and enjoy subsidised room, mess, infrastructure even when they are 45 years of age. Poor Tax Payers have to foot the bill by way of subsidises. What is their contribution to India, World after enjoying the subsidies and unquestioned freedom? How many Nobel Laureautes? A thorough review should be undertaken and all subsides to be stopped. JNU should take it up as a challenge, prove its mettle,start generating revenue on its own and prove the claim "the most intellectually-superior institute in India" by being self-sufficient in all respects and standing on its feet. Hardworking Indian Tax Payers generate revenue  to be squandered by "Political" institutes like JNU,Delhi.
