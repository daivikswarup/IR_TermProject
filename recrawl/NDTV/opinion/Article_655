Headline::::What Modi Has Not Recognised About Pakistan



DateTime::::2015-06-15T14:49:00+05:30




                                A friend of mine from Pakistan, who literally spends his time 24x7 attempting to build a constructive relationship between his country and ours, was in Delhi the morning after Rajyavardhan Rathore and Manohar Parrikar had displayed, if not their 56-inch chests (which they do not have, whatever their hashtag), but, at any rate, the hair on their chests, in an infantile effort to prove that if we can intrude a few kilometres into the wilderness of the west Myanmar jungle, Pakistan (and China) had better watch out.
The Chinese have dismissed this childishness with the contempt it deserves. Pakistan has reacted with outrage. After all, that part of China where Rathore and Parrikar are threatening to ingress is where, as Pandit Nehru memorably and accurately put it, a region "where not a blade of grass grows". Much of the India-Pakistan border, unlike the India-Myanmar border, is heavily populated. Little wonder the Pakistani reaction has been so sharp.
My friend shook his head sadly and remarked that in the face of Modi's hostility, space was rapidly shrinking for Pakistan's peace constituency, which, under Manmohan Singh's regime had grown exponentially, notwithstanding 26/11. The tone now, he said, is being set by the Jama'at-e-Islami, a party that has never won more than a couple of seats in any election but disproportionately influences public opinion when animosity is provoked.
Coincidentally, the week that saw the rumpus was witness also to the launch in India of Christophe Jaffrelot's magnum opus, The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience. Jaffrelot, French by nationality but with academic positions at the Sorbonne, in London and in Princeton, is increasingly being recognized as the West's foremost scholar of politics and society in contemporary India and Pakistan. This work is 700 pages long but to understand its essence, it is not necessary to go beyond the three words of its sub-title: Instability and Resilience. No one needs to be educated on Pakistan's chronic instability, but Jaffrelot's innovative angle lies in also recognizing Pakistan's amazing "resilience".
Jaffrelot, in another work, spiritedly described the ethos of Pakistan as "Nationalism without a Nation"! Here he argues that notwithstanding all the problems of nation-building that have beset Pakistan since its conception and, increasingly, since its sudden and blood-soaked inception as an independent state in 1947, unlike numerous other emerging nations, particularly in Africa, the Idea of Pakistan has repeatedly trumped fissiparous tendencies, especially since Pakistan assumed its present form in 1971. And its institutions have withstood repeated buffeting that almost anywhere elsewhere would have resulted in the State crumbling. Despite numerous dire forecasts of imminently proving to be a "failed state", Pakistan has survived, bouncing back every now and then as a recognizable democracy with a popularly elected civilian government, the military in the wings but politics very much centre-stage, linguistic and regional groups pulling and pushing, sectarian factions murdering each other, but the Government of Pakistan remaining in charge, and the military stepping in to rescue the nation from chaos every time Pakistan appeared on the knife's edge. The disintegration of Pakistan has been predicted often enough, most passionately now that internally-generated terrorism and externally sponsored religious extremism are consistently taking on the state to the point that the army is so engaged in full-time and full-scale operations in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan that some 40,000 lives have been lost in the battle against fanaticism and insurgency.
"And yet," as was said on a more famous occasion, "it works!" Pakistan and her people keep coming back, resolutely defeating sustained political, armed and terrorist attempts to break down the country and undermine its ideological foundations. That is what Jaffrelot calls its "resilience". That resilience is not recognized in Modi's India. That is what leads the Rathores and the Parrikars to make statements that find a certain resonance in anti-Pakistan circles in India but dangerously leverage the impact on Pakistani public opinion of anti-India circles in Pakistan. The Parrikars and the Saeeds feed on each other. It is essential that both be overcome.
But even as there are saner voices in India than Rathore's, so also are there saner - much saner - voices in Pakistan than Hafiz Saeed's. Many Indians would prefer a Pakistan overflowing with Saeeds to keep their bile flowing. So would many Pakistanis prefer an India with the Rathores overflowing to keep the bile flowing. At eight times Pakistan's size, we can flex our muscles like the bully on the school play field. But Pakistan's resilience ensures that all that emerges from Parrikar and Rathore are empty words. India is no more able than Pakistan is to destroy the other country.
Except by resort to nuclear weapons that will destroy both. Musharraf bluntly recognized this when he threatened nuclear war in response to Parrikar's boasts. Fortunately, most Pakistanis dismiss their Musharrafs as hollow vessels making the most noise. There is, nevertheless, a real danger - for it would take only one madman, a Muslim or a Hindu Dr. Strangelove, to turn forever the world's most populated region into a nuclear wasteland.
We must settle, not aggravate, our differences. Of course, there are formidable hurdles in the way. But no more formidable than between the West and the Communists in Korea or Vietnam, or Cuba or Nicaragua, or apartheid South Africa or Namibia / Angola / Mozambique, or Iran and the US, or Iran and Saudi Arabia, or Syria, or Palestine. In all these cases, including with the Taliban in Qatar, the negotiating table is the last field of battle.
We have been to war with Pakistan three times in seven decades. Skirmishes have been almost continuous. The rhetoric against each other is high-pitched. The trumpets of hate have prevailed over the pleading for peace. Yet, if Kissinger and Le Duc Tho could talk while blasting each other to smithereens, or Kennedy and Khrushchev negotiate their way out of the Cuban missile crisis, what stands in the way of India having the courage to trade charges face-to-face with Pakistan rather than oratorically firing from the shoulders of the Rathores and the Parrikars?
The ending of hostility has never been a condition precedent for effective negotiations. Our insistence on the desired outcome being guaranteed before we even begin to talk is not a sign of strength but a form of cowardice. A real 56-inch foreign policy does not consist of dramatically inviting the enemy to the swearing in, then swearing that talks will be resumed, and then swearing at him for following a practice with the Hurriyat that has been par for the course for the last 15 years. However, that, alas, has been our Pakistan policy in the first year of the Modi government.
I am ashamed, not proud, of a Prime Minister who ostentatiously reads a journal when the Pakistanti PM is passing behind him on his way to the podium at SAARC. A truly courageous Prime Minister would grasp the proffered opportunity and say what he has to say face-to-face, not thunder from an isolated bunker, as Modi and his cohort have been doing. Traipsing around the world is no substitute for earnestly tackling India's most stubborn foreign policy problem - Pakistan.

Wasn't this the same pakiistan that launched the Mumbai attacks, and encouraged terrorist insurgency that killed thousands? How can you talk to someone who's not in control of his country?

                            I know that Mani has written a lot of crap in his previous columns but this has to rank as Mani's worst article. The way he brazenly sides with Pakistan and opposes the Indian PM is simply nauseating. This moron will go to any extent - even destroy India, just to demean Modi BJP. Shame on you. It is almost laughable that this senile idiot thinks that Pakistan is genuinely attempting peace talks. Offering to talk on one side while clandestinely supporting terrosirts and plotting the enemy's downfall is an age old strategy. The chinese are exceptional at it. It is because of idiots like MSI that they have been able to pull off these tricks time after time. He wants to take the enemy's words on face value but not his PMs. Hilarious, really !! This moron does not even know that the only thing - THE ONLY THING that keeps Pakistan united is hatred against India. That is how the nation was born and that is what makes it still tick. If this moron does not know it, then I pity him.

                            Mr MSA you espouse Pandit Nehru every now &amp; then but conveniently forget that two nation theory was British ploy to divide India and Pandit Nehru played along like a naive school boy.  It showed not only his lack of vision but his gullibility of not understanding British design. Undivided India was a threat to both British Power at that time and it's influence in the region. You &amp; your pseudo intellectuals fail to see writing on the wall that Pakistan today is a failed state run by Mafia like Army whose sole purpose is to generate overseas funds to line their pocket. The civilian government of that country is no better. Their citizen live is acute crisis of survival, a blast here a blast their, constant energy crisis and no development. Now coming to the way forward to peace.  The only way forward is for Pakistan to destroy all terrorist camps &amp; dismantle it's ISI whose only purpose is to create Anti India narrative to be sold to masses. Without these, nothing is going to work. When 26/11 happened we citizens of India were glued to our TVs as horrors  of this attack was unfolding.  What did your Congress Party do at that time?  You had a very weak PM  MMS who instead of taking this head on, left it for his policy makers to decide best way forward which was sleep on the issue &amp; people will forget.

                            So much love and respect for PAK after 40 years of them terrorizing us? It's time we stopped being pushovers and have the courage (which Congress never had!) to stand up to our enemies. Every person and country should know their limits, so they are remembered as brave... not idiots.<br/><br/>
Lastly, please start your immigration process for PAK, I'm sure you will be 'at peace' there.

2.In spite of your 60 years of peace talks, where you able to prevent terrorist attacks from Pakistan?<br/>
3.Resilience is nothing new to human kind.Any body with systematic mental and physical exercises can build it over a period of time.India exhibited resilience throughout 20 centuries once such incident when the barbarians destroyed somnath temple 17 times but built it back everytime. This resilience saw decay when you family regime came to power and injected the utopian,valueless,clerical education.<br/><br/>

Every country now has terrorists on its land. The point about Pakistan is that a lot of them even now (post Peshawar) are aided and abetted by the Pakistani establishment (read Pakistan's Army) which has not abandoned its policy of using terrorism to hurt India.

                            In Bengali, there is a story about a student who was asked to write an essay about a personality.  The poor soul did not know anything about the personality.  All he did in preparation for the exam was gather everything he could about the cow hoping that this would be the topic he would need to write about.  So, he ended up  with starting the essay saying that the personality had a cow and wrote everything he knew about cow and finished the essay that way.

                            Equating Hafeez Saeed the rogue terrorist who planned 26/11 attack with one of the most honest and down to earth chief ministers and now the Defence Minister of a democratically elected government. Vow Mr. Aiyer ..even the Pakistanis would not have guts to do that. Kudos Mr. Aiyer this must be the lowest ebb that you can ever touch

                            -As Pandit Nehru memorably and accurately put it, a region "where not a blade of grass grows" - which is why he gave away large parts to China, like it was his ancestral property. It might be difficult for you Mani to grasp this fact, but the Gandhis do not own India, although they have done enough damage to it - Enough! #CongressMuktBharat

                            It is a peculiar problem with congress. They are not bound by ideology, nor a philosophy nor the nation. Their allegiance is strictly to a singular family. This causes them to disunite a country even if we were to go to war (God forbid). This mind set has to be laid bare before the people. It is ironical, the party claims to be direct descendant of the party that fought for independence. The DNA has certainly changed. Any claim of links to the historical party is for nothing but political mileage.<br/><br/>

                            Mani the moron needs to quote Jaffrelot's writing in order to analyse Pakistan and its resilience.  I don't.  Those of us with even a modicum of knowledge will know that since its inception, Pakistan has been propped up by foreigners.  First by the British who when being booted out created the state of Pakistan as revenge.  That was only possible by the scheming British agent Nehru whose spying activities on behalf of his British masters continued long after they had left, as evidenced by papers relating to Bose only now coming to light.  Gandhi was another feeble and unworthy leader who enabled Pakistan to come into being.  When the British lost interest in Pakistan, the US took over by enrolling Pakistan in CENTO.  It was from Pakistan that the U2 spy plane flew over Russia.  After its shooting down, and with the capture of Gary Powers, Pakistan was warned in  no uncertain terms that if any more spy planes flew over Russia from Pakistan, it, Pakistan would be obliterated by the Soviet Union.  When Pakistan got a well deserved kicking in the 1971 war and the US 7th Fleet was sent to invade India, the Soviet Union caused the mighty 7th fleet to turn tail and flee.  The US nevertheless continued to prop up Pakistan as it was through Pakistan that the door to China was opened; Kissinger himself has said so in his book.  Pakistan was further used and abused by the USA when its trained terrorists, the Taliban were sent from bases in Pakistan to inflict a thousand cuts on the Soviets who were occupying Afghanistan at the time.  Those who administered the thousand cuts then kicked the US in the testicles in the September 2001 Twin towers attack!  The USA has no need for Pakistan now and even the Chinese will abandon that country as it is a pointless, useless country that only characters such as Mani the moron admire.  It has no resilience, after all, the whole of its east broke away and formed Bangladesh.  Soon, Baluchistan will break away and form an independent nation.  The Balochis have no interest in cavorting with the Punjabis, unlike the Mani the moron.  Resilience and Pakistan do not go together.  Terrorism and Pakistan do go hand in hand.  Pigeon chested Mani the moron does not speak for any Indians; we are quite capable of speaking for ourselves.  Mani the moron mentioned his Pakistani friend; he would wouldn't he?  After all, he does not have any Indian friends!  He merely gets used by that dreadful parivar that he grovels to; once they have no need for him, Mani the moron will have nowhere to go!

                            Mr Aiyar, despite your kind and generous perspective towards pakistan, the fundamental problem is pakistan really has no basis to exist. Islam is simply another man made belief system concocted over time with borrowings from Roman fantasy, myths of the Old and New Testament and Zoroastrianism. It simply does not have the solutions to the problems of a complex modern world. Pakistan needs to be released from the cage of islam it is imprisoned in and brought to reason. But that is asking the impossible! So pakistan will fester (resilience !?)in its morass till such time as it implodes which is when the region will be confronted with a bigger nightmare. Thus, a regional strategic partnership comprising the neighbourhood countries is vital, to make its demise as painless as possible.

                            What a fool! He still thinks that Pakistan can be trusted! Poor, tired old Aiyer. Living in a world long gone, populated with Nehruvian sayings. And who needs Pakistan's friendship? Yes, when the cowardly UPA was there, Indian nationalism took a hard knock. And the UPA government shivered before any third rate bully. What do you expect from a nominated Prime Minister and an Italian Congress President? For sycophants like Aiyer, these facts make no difference, as he has lived without shame for years. But for any self respecting Indian, those ghastly years of corruption, nepotism and incompetence remain a nightmare. And who is Jaffrelot, except just another witless European writer trying to make sense of sub continental issues beyond his comprehension? Only Aiyer would consider him an authority! The whole article smells. Of decay, envy, spite and malevolence. All negative, nothing positive of the brave new India that aspires to be the best in the world. Aiyer's actual target is not the NDA government or Modi, for whom he has a visceral hatred. No, his fury is actually against the people of India, for having so ruthlessly thrown out the crass UPA and ushered in the so much better NDA government. RIP, Aiyer.

                            Mani has all the solution for last 60 years but left it to modi to solve. <br/>
What secularist like mani doesn't tell the public why is this problem between the india and Pakistan. And why is this hatred is not seen between any two neighbouring countries in south Asia.The reason is India is not fighting a country but a bigoted idea which wants the fall of Hindu india at any cost. Mani has lots to share about resilience of Pakistanis but won't tell this resilience is developed by hate for India. This is what is holding pakistan to gather. And any amount of soothing balm is not going to bring that hate down.<br/>
We are a bigger nation but we never behaved like one until now. Mani and secularist should understand very clearly there will be peace till the time our citizens and jawans are not killed either by state or stateless actors from across the border. And using the threat of nuclear every time will not be of any use. We will die so will they but it better than to be bleed every day.

Just to enlighten to you a bit.<br/>
Mahavir Tyagi who served as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament (1962–64) from Congress famously criticised Nehru's statement in the Indian Parliament in the prelude to the Sino-Indian War when Nehru infamously commented that "Not a blade of grass grows in Aksai Chin", attempting to explain that Aksai Chin was a barren, inhospitable land and the nation had lost little by its occupation by China. Tyagi retorted, pointing to Nehru's bald head: "Nothing grows here ..should it be cut off or given away to somebody else?".

                            In all honesty, not a bad article by MSA (far less manic when compared to his earlier drivel). Sadly, he misses the point. India's strategy towards Pakistan is no longer a defensive one. They are now actively working to undermine the foundations of the "resilient" state. This means going after Balochistan, arming terrorist factions in their turf war against the Pakistani establishment and turning Pakistani assets into Indian ones in the Kashmir valley. <br/><br/>
Pakistan's resilience has been largely predicated on a lack of aggression from India. This is about to change...

                            It is amply demonstrated that peace overtures don't work with Pakistan. Rather it makes things worse. The way they released Lakhvi, after India softened its position, proves the point. It is insanity to keep trying the same thing expecting different results. They will not change, as they have support from USA, China and to some degree from Saudi Arabia. The Government and Army just play good cop and bad cop to force India's hand. They will change only if they end up paying for their terrorism. So far it has been risk-less terrorism for them. They will not be able to get Kashmir either. The world does not want yet another Islamic nation that will become a support base for ISIS and Al Qaeda. The experience in Egypt, Iraq and Lybia and involvement in Syria made matters worse for everybody. Shia Muslims are safer in India than in Sunni Countries and to some degree vice versa.

                            Mr. Aiyyer, please treat the Myanmaar event as just a stern message to Pakistan. You may derive meanings to the statements from Rathore and Parriker as you may, but the fact remains that Pakistan can't keep its mission on and on and there is no creditable defence feom Indian side, but just "aman ki aasha". Now onwards Pakistan will think ten times before indulging in state terrorism it has been involved since decades. Purpose served...

                            "The rhetoric against each other is high-pitched." Are you really out of your mind? Which world do you live in?<br/>
Here is the truth Congress and Pakistan miss: INDIANS ARE INTERESTED IN BECOMING ANOTHER CHINA, NOT INTERESTED IN AFFAIRS OF A FAILED NEIGHBOR UNLESS BOTHERED WITH BULLETS AND BOMBS.

                            Conventional  Wars may happen between Pakistan and India. but nuclear wars are very unlikely; and India can't be and should not be  black mailed by nuclear war threat. Neither peace talks nor wars nor terror tactics can solve Kashmir problem.Only time can solve this complex problem; and longer athe time it takes more favorable it is for  India.Pak army and politicians are using Kashmir issue to side track real issues that concern Pak people like economic development, inflation, jobs,etc. Pak army has developed a vested interest in Kashmir issue to justify its own existence and huge expenditure on defense.Similarly militant groups are also have a vested interest to justify their existence. If a solution is so easy, the  issue could have been resolved long back.Putting Kasmir issue on back burner,  and arriving at a feasible economic co-operation between two countries for the benefit of its people is the real way forward.

                            Didn't bother reading the article. Comments confirm that it would have been wastage of time anyway.<br/>
I think this is another case where degrees should be validated
