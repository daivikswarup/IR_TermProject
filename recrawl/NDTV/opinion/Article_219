Headline::::When We Couldn't Stop a Whale From Dying Near Mumbai



DateTime::::2015-06-26T18:35:00+05:30




                                Ask most children to imagine the largest animal they have ever known about and they will all say dinosaurs. But the simple and most magical truth is that the single largest animal ever to grace this planet lives in the right now with us... the blue whale. Bigger than any other prehistoric animal, bigger than any other creature that inhabits land or sea.
How big you ask? Well, on an average between 80 to a 100 feet long, weighing in at about 180 tonnes. It is as big as a Boeing 737 airplane. It's heart is the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, it's tongue as heavy as that of an entire African elephant, and its cry louder than the roar of a jet plane.
 
An estimated 350,000 blue whales were killed in the 20th century. Today, they are classified as endangered. It's illegal to kill them and population numbers are estimated between 2,500 and 5,000. If the sub-species of the Pygmy blue is to be added, the numbers might be slightly higher.
And one washed up at the Alibaugh beach near Mumbai. It was alive when it washed up on Wednesday and died a day later. Without any protocol in place for stranded whales, all attempts at refloating it failed and finally it was buried in a 50-foot grave. Tissue samples have been taken for DNA analysis as there is no one in India qualified to perform a proper necropsy on it. A necropsy is important in order to understand if there was any internal sickness in the whale that caused her to beach herself.(The Blue Whale that beached at Alibaug was about 42 feet long.) 
It will be easy to be critical of all these facts, but here is the truth. Firstly, while whale strandings might not be rare, they are not exactly frequent. An estimated 2,000 cetaceans beach themselves a year. Cetaceans also include dolphins. Secondly, most beachings end in death with or without human intervention. Usually, it's the toothed whales and not the filter feeders who beach. Blue whales are filter feeders and strandings are practically unheard of.  And thirdly, the whale that washed up in Alibaugh could not have been refloated without either a hovercraft or a chopper big enough to airlift it into deeper waters. The damage a whale does to itself when it beaches is also usually fatal. The reason it beaches itself is usually because of injury, sickness, disorientation or pod sympathy.(Pictures posted on Facebook showed people standing on top of the stranded animal.)
Unlike a lot of other whales, blue whales do not move in pods larger than three members. Pod sizes matter when it comes to strandings. The larger the pods, the more probable a stranding, because if one member is in distress, the others rush in to help, invariably getting stuck themselves. Whales are some of the most sentient beings on the planet, with deep family and social bonds, and often healthy members of a pod will beach along with sick ones in a collective decision to be together. Even blue whales that move in such small groups can communicate over thousands of kilometres so are probably in touch with other family or social members without having to be together.
 
The size of this whale, about 42 feet, makes one wonder if it was either a newly-weaned calf or a young Pygmy blue whale. What caused it to wash up? Inexperience and a navigational error? Sonar interference? Or sickness? Hopefully, DNA analysis of the tissue samples will tell us what sub-species of blue whale it was and also what was wrong. Sometimes, sonar interference with whales' natural navigational systems throws them off course. At others, a quick change in the coastline with the forming of a new sandbar can cause shallow water where there was no memory of such. It has been speculated that whales use the magnetic field of the earth as well to navigate, and small oceanic quakes or strong lightening storms can mess with that.
 
Beached whales usually die from dehydration, their internal organs slowly being crushed by their own weight. Rising tides can cover their blow hole, drowning them. As graceful as whales can be in the water, as mammals they need air to breathe. Very few rescues have been successful - usually only if the animal itself cooperates and wants to be rescued.
Beaching is not a new phenomenon. It has happened through human memory and history. It's clearly something cetaceans do when in distress. It could be that their first instinct is to breathe and not drown and so they move towards shallower waters. Drowning ironically is probably a far more terrifying prospect than beaching.
 
India has zero protocol for strandings. But it's not unique to just us. A few years ago, about 15 pilot whales beached themselves in Cape Town and I watched the hours of immense struggle to get them back in the water. They were 1/3rd the size of the Aligbaug beached blue whale and 1/3rd its weight, and yet, they could not be refloated. A few that had been pushed into deeper waters came right back to the beach. To be with their family. Finally, authorities shot them in the head. There seemed to be no other choice. Even here, there was no proper equipment like flotation rafts, hover crafts, etc to get the animals out to sea.
 
The one thing that could have been done in Alibaugh, and should be done in the future, is crowd control. There are pictures on social media of locals posing for photos, standing on the whale. Think of how that could have added to the distress and suffering of the animal. We also need to charter protocol - how can we best help? Saving a blue whale may be a near- impossible feat, but dolphins are much easier to protect.  
Our coastal waters in India are so extensively polluted that mass dolphin strandings have become common.
As the old wise people of the ocean, whales and dolphins are trying to tell us something each time they strand. Sometimes it's a cry for help and sometimes it's just so we can bear witness to the ravages we are responsible for in the ocean or the state of the ocean itself.

                            There is no value for human life here. Why expect sympathy for a sea-living creature? It is a stuggle for majority of Indians to think beyond their homes, politics and movies. Iam happy atleast someone took notice to write about this. I personally felt like losing a friend. And not many would understand what I mean.<br/><br/>
Thanks NDTV for publishing this article. This is responsible journalism.

                            As the author said, other nations too are novice in handling such instances with no protocol and training in place. But as each crisis throws up new learning / opportunity; new laws and governance model should be framed. RIP blue whale.

                            We Indians have no empathy for animals. I daresay half of those thugs would even be vegetarian. God, if we can't even treat utterly defenceless animals proper (like this Hidutva government permitting catching snakes for nag panchami), how are we even going to be considerate to fellow humans?!

But, No, even this needs a political and religious discussion. Wow! If we can't even the Blue Whale out of it, then you know we have gone too far.<br/><br/>
I ask all of us to climb out of our deep holes, and take some action.

                            Nobody can avoid death and that is the real beauty of this world, even God has to die when time comes. Whale has come to shore to die and it is cruelty not allow whale to die peacefully and put under medical torture in the name of saving life. Animal do not scare to die like humans and they also do not exploit or kill innocent to secure sit in haven.

                            As per the author, If the creature is very big, then that must be protected.  Why can't the author show same kind of concern for cows/pigs which are killed every day in India. She tries too hard to come across as different thinker. Nothing will change and the author will continue with her normal day to day work life thinking she has scored some,brownie points by writing first about unique incident.

                            I totally recognize the fact that we had no protocol to safeguard this poor whale over the beach and probably all the efforts that could have made were futile. But another side of it that appalled me to the core is the insensitivity and indifference towards ones sufferings and making a show out of it. <br/>
While we as pople stand road side, make videos, take selfies and see another human die in dire need of help, what can we expect in this case is anyone's guess.<br/>
Not even humans who take birth in this land of utter indifference and discord with fellow human being sufferings, even the animals who are washed to its shore are also doomed to suffer same fate. Quite an Indian trait.!
