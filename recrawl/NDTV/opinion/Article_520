Headline::::Good Show, Rahul, But Can You Keep It Up



DateTime::::2015-04-21T00:38:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published in 2015.)
"Desh ke hain, aapke nahi hain kya? Woh, aapke PM nahi hai kya?" (Is he not your PM) asked Rahul Gandhi in a rare direct sarcastic jibe to BJP leaders when they asked him to refrain from calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi 'their' PM.
The Gandhi scion was speaking in parliament on the first day of the reconvened Budget session in which the government seeks to introduce the controversial Land Acquisition Ordinance.
Rahul, who has returned to politics and the public sphere after a two-month sabbatical which saw him skipping the first half of the budget session, seemed to have finally sprung into action with impromptu humour. That was not without visible and frequent help from friend and MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was seated next to him, and appeared to supply crisp adjectives.
Social media enthusiasts and observers snatched the speech to either attack or promote. One tweet cheekily observed, 'Vipassna rocks'. The reference here was to the speculation that Rahul had spent a better part of his vacation in one of the East Asian countries for a meditation course. There was the expected fierce criticism - #RahulRoar and #PappuMeows were equal and opposite hashtags.
Rahul's speech in Parliament followed the Congress rally in Delhi on Sunday against the government's planned land reforms. At the event, both the Gandhis and their speeches evoked a mixed response. While Rahul, who has been referred to by BJP spokespersons as an "item number" from the Congress party came across as uninspiring, while mother Sonia got decent reviews. Â 
So it was the power-packed performance in Parliament today that has led to the suggestion that it is too early to write off the 'Yuvraj'.
From taking a dig at BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, who he called 'a man who spoke his heart and the truth', quoting the Nagpur leader's speech in which he inadvertently suggested the government's helplessness in helping farmers, to mocking Modi's suit that hogged headlines during President Obama's visit, here was an astute and shrewd Indian politician who finally spoke the language that the common Indian can understand. "aapne auction kar diya, humne bolna band kar diya" (to end the controversy over the suit, it was auctioned), Rahul said with heaps of sarcasm.
With the trademark 'bhaiyya' which he used to address the audience in his speech (a very North Indian term of reference), the punchline of Rahul Gandhi's speech was the "suit-boot ki sarkaar" quip.
Another sharp attack lay in "udyogpatiyon ki sarkaar" which many in the Congress party suggested was a reference to Modi's friendship with 'A' league business houses (reference to Adanis and Ambanis).
What caught my eye most importantly was the placement of MPs around Rahul Gandhi that included Jyotiraditya Scindia, Gaurav Gogoi and other youth leaders - this comes after Digvijaya Singh's comment that senior leaders like him ought to take a backseat.
Digvijaya, who is a self-confessed Rahul Gandhi mentor, has suggested on various occasions that Rahul take over the reins of the party as opposed to the advisors in the Congress who take the most important calls. Keep in mind that reportedly, the primary reason for Rahul's sabbatical was his protest against what he called the interference and hegemony of veteran party leaders who refused to let reforms take their course in the party.
Another aspect worth noticing was the presence of MPCC chief Ashok Chavan who had to resign as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra over his alleged involvement in the Adarsh scam.
However, Chavan was re-inducted as the face of the party in Maharashtra this March - he is the only top leader from the state who managed to retain his seat in parliament. It is common knowledge that Rahul was not very keen to have Chavan back as the state chief.
As a political journalist, I looked for Chavan's less-than-animated response to Rahul's speech, while his relatively 'younger' colleagues like Gaurav backed their leader with witty repartees, bringing some much-needed spunk to an opposition that has lacked punch so far.
So should we laud Rahul Gandhi for the comeback and for asking the Prime Minister uncomfortable questions in the parliament over his alleged political miscalculations? Was an impassioned Jyotiraditya speech (laced with Sanksrit verses) asking for an apology from Giriraj Singh the perfect accompaniment to Rahul's new vigor? Are the young turks in the opposition finally showing some flavour of an active opposition? In an agrarian country where beef ban has proved to be a more significant achievement over farmer suicides in the last one year, one wished this was indeed the case.
When Venkaiah Naidu got up to clarify a point mentioned by Rahul Gandhi, he asked Bihar MP Pappu Yadav to keep calm. I, like many parliamentarians, for a split second took that as a jibe against Rahul Gandhi who is trolled as "Pappu" by the BJP social media brigade.
The moment didn't scale up, the reason being a rather sprightly approach to the discussion where it seemed that for once, the Congress was enjoying its job, that of being a responsible opposition. Rahul did not appear to be in the mode of crown prince of the Congress, and wore a gracious smile when one of the leaders congratulated him for his return from a two-month vacation on a foreign land.
Compliments aside, as I write this, my cynicism takes over, for we have been subject to many such one-time hits in the past, which were followed by a rather abysmal and uninspiring performance by Rahul who was either caught napping by the cameras in parliament or had the country looking for him.
Should Rahul Gandhi want to lead the party and send out a message to his detractors, he needs to sustain this performance in parliament and outside. He needs to know that a little bit of humility can go a long way in healing a disastrous performance by him and his party. He needs to understand we live in a politically-aware country where the performance of the opposition is looked at with as much expectation and attention as that of the government.
When Rahul Gandhi returns to his residence tonight, he should watch his speech and the reactions to it, and judge his performance with clinical precision and understand that in politics there is always scope for improvement - and that actions - especially being present and participating in parliament - speak far louder than words.
Rahul Gandhi should be thankful that India is an agrarian country where farmers of the land have overturned kingdoms and governments. It's time Rahul makes a comeback as a full-time politician and keeps the ruling government on its toes for the idea of a country that he repeats in his speeches so often. It's time Rahul leads from the front than going back in a shell of self-introspection.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It started again. We can see more than 100+ articles for Rahul's today's speech. Stupidity of Indian journalism. No one reported Govt's reply to his speech.People are sitting in AC rooms and writing articles about RG without knowing anything. No one understood why Cong is opposing Land Bill. Even this media house also doesn't show interest in discuss it in detail. Because there is no substance in it. They just took the issue to resell the bad product Rahul Gandhi.First ask Rahul to return the land occupied by his BIL in Haryana &amp; Rajasthan.

                            Wow Rana Ayyub. The way you have written the article suggests as if Rahul Gandhi is the savior of the country and all of us need to be in awe of him - For one speech - that too a generic govt bashing speech without suggesting an alternative approach to address the issue??? I will bet my one months salary that Rahul does not even understand the content of the ordinance completely. For that matter, based on his one interview in 2014, the entire country knows that he has no basic understanding of any - i repeat ANY issue. His replies to questions are incoherent and betray a lack of in-depth analysis of any issue. The way some of the biased "media commentators" - like you sing praises of him after he skipped an entire session of parliament makes me sick. If you guys need money, let the people know. This country has enough money to fund the likes of you - but dont destroy the country by projecting incompetent people as "leaders". There are at least a dozen guys in the Congress party itself including J Scindia, S pilot etc who are a million times better than this sub-standard guy.

                            Another patchy article may be like Rahul's speech and performance in last 10 years. Quality of Indian Journalism is so low that we get such  nonsensical blogs from so called intellectuals. Why Indian farmers are still miserable ! Do these half baked journalists  have courage to ask RAGA , whose party has led India for more than 5 decades! It is becoming theater of absurds.

                            Ms Ayyub,<br/><br/>
We all know that Rahul is a joker. His whimper in the parliament about a non issue has been heralded as his second coming.<br/>
The truth is he is a spineless , directionless bufoon who has no idea about the real India, aspirations of its youth. The support he is getting from zamindaar claas farmers is nothing but opportunistic. These feudal lords have been fooling govts posing as farmers. The truth is real farmers aree those landless labourers. These real farmers are committing suicides since they are not able payback the money they had promised when taking the land on lease from these zamindaars.<br/>
This is a open secret just like the coruption that happens at checkposts and airports.

                            You, Ms Ayub, can now start writing for the congress party...the party that destroyed India and its poor in the 60 years of its rule. Today, PM Modi is trying to reshape all that was wrong, today PM Modi is trying his best to give India what she was denied in her 60 years of congress rule. Inspite of all this the entire opposition the INC,SP,BSP,Left,NCP etc along with the Indian media is trying to pull PM Modi and the nation down!. Under PM Modi, India can rewrite history and again emerge as a world super power. This is the best chance that we have got in the past 1000 years, to rise again to glory! So, lets not waste it by colouring the people as left and right and avoiding the real question.

                            Rana Ayyub's puerile writings do not show any signs of investigation or originality. For god's sake (sorry communists this is a proper phrase in English), do not hype one or two speeches made using lies and half truths. People are not going to forget the massive loot that happened under UPA regimes and the arrogance of congress leaders. The land acquisition bill is the right thing for India and the detractors are trying to make political capital out of this. Is it possible to have a 5 star hotel in a village where there is no reason for people to go and stay? People go for reasons of tourism or business, none of these exists in most villages in India at present. Get real, if a businessman builds a 5 star hotel in a village it is going to be a failure. The only possible use of land acquired in villages is for use of villagers to build rural infrastructure. The consent clause remains in the law for private acquisition, it is only for government acquisition that it has been removed and that also after paying 4 times the market price.

                            The media is desperately trying to promote Mr Prince to have some (weak) opposition against Mr Feku. But the world of politics has moved on...it is time for action but these two are busy fighting it out on TV. On the hand Kejriwal is currently the man of action. It is going to pretty difficult for the media to try to fool people twice -come LokSabha 2019 elections these two are history.

                            The number one reason that India will take far more time to become a developed nation or beat China - if ever - is because of the news media populated with mediocre journalists who only enjoy being part of the tamasha and making it a bigger one for the sake of TRPs. Like so many have said before nobody is talking about the content of the ordinance. All news channels are discussing is who commented what and how the power tussle is going on. The poor and illiterate farmers hardly have any idea what's going on. They will just sway towards the opinion projected by a superficial and irresponsible media. Pathetic and shameful.

                            The BJP may be right or wrong, but the Congress has no business to question the former on this issue. By taking which farmer's consent did the Congress launch the poisonous Green Revolution in the late 1960s which is the root cause of the current agricultural crisis in the country today. Does it have any scruples for what it has done? And most shamelessly it has crowned the very criminal M.S.Swaminathan who stole and gave away our seed varieties, with Padma Vibhushans and chairmanship of National Commission on Farmers. <br/><br/>
As for the BJP, in it's "infinite wisdom" it has presented C.Subramaniam with the Bharat Ratna" award in 1998. This man who never set his foot on an agricultural field nor knew a bit about cows and what constitutes sustainable farming, plunged the nation into this Satanic chemical farming model at the <br/>
behest of America, in the most traitorous manner! How deplorable that the BJP found it fit to respect him!<br/><br/>
The SKanda Purana tells that wherever the worthy are despised and the unworthy are celebrated, there 3 things will prevail - Durbhiksham, Maranam, Bhayam!<br/><br/>
That might probably be the reason why the BJP met with "Satya Naash" in the 2004 elections for the blunder of respecting "progressive, secular, modern, scientific" traitors who belonged to the Congress!! <br/><br/>
Hence the congress has no right to champion the cause of farmers today which is insufferably ridiculous and unjust!

                            This article is farcical to say the least. It would be a good idea if the journalists actually spent a few minutes to reflect and write insightful articles instead of stating the obvious and providing personal opinions in the form of commentary. The real question to be asked is what are the key issues on which Rahul Gandhi has provided counter proposals on strategy or implementation after critiquing the current government position? It is not of much use to just produce a critique-a-moment with no follow up solutions.

The fact is farmer suicides began in the Congress era and have continued. The fact is farmers are no worse off now or better off now except for the unseasonal rains. And all the opposition can do is play politics.

                            Excellent Article.<br/><br/>
India is an agricultural country and ours is agrarian economy. India lives in villages. The villagers depend on agriculture. They are either farmers or workers on the agricultural fields. Ours industries and urban business also depend on agriculture. Thus, an Indian farmer truly represents India. He can be called the son of the soil.<br/><br/>
An Indian farmer is very hard working. He is very busy throughout the year. For him there is no rest. He is engaged in tilling the soil, sowing the seeds, watering the fields, reaping and harvesting the crop and then taking it to the market to sell it. And yet he is very poor.<br/><br/>
Moreover his needs are few and simple and yet they are not met,<br/><br/>
Farmer s Are Backbone of the Nation:<br/>
"Because they feed everyone in the nation"<br/><br/>
. If he is not cultivating crops  then  government has to import food therefore it lead to Food inflation very high.<br/>
. If he is not dependent on agriculture then we (people) will starve for food.<br/><br/>
The much trumpeted green revolution in reality turned out to be a farce and was not able to either sustain production or improve farmers' lives. "What is the use of only fields turning green? The lives of farmers must also turn green with money. Only then can we accept it as a revolution," says One Farmer. "A sugarcane farmer goes through much hardship and it is the sugarcane mill owner who prospers.<br/>
A paddy farmer remains poor throughout his life but the rice mill owner expands his mill or even buys two or three additional rice mills. Similarly it is not a cotton farmer but the buyer who flourishes.<br/>
"This is the ground reality. Even a 10-acre farmer is driven to sell his lands for getting money to finance his daughter's wedding." <br/>
The Government's campaign that rural India is shining and that too brightly, is just an eye wash. India no longer lives in villages; it lives in cities and cramped towns.<br/>
"The barren fields and almost empty streets in many villages with dilapidated homes are living proof of this," <br/>
Dr.A.Jagadeesh  Nellore(AP)

                            I have never seen a more pedestrian person or a more  pathetic article like this one.But then, what can you expect from a person or persons who have a natural, pathological hatred towards anything that is even remotely connected with BJP and specially Modi. Her bio has she is working on a book on Modi. One needn't wait for it to be published as one can easily predict verbatim what it will be about and how it will read. One also wonders how can she (or anybody else) write a book about another person without having deep and long conversations/interviews/interactions with the person whose biography you are writing about. And, I have my doubts if she has even come within 25 feet from him, let alone speak or talk to him.

                            WHEN MY CHILD STARTED TALKING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  LIFE I FELT ELATED BEYOND WORDS! I RECORDED IT AND PLAYED IT ON AND ON AND SHOWED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. I DECIPHERED EVERY BIT OF IT AND READ SO MANY MEANINGS AND ACCENTS AND STARTED DREAMING HOW MY CHILD WILL BECOME A SUPER ORATOR PAR EXCELLENCE LATER ON IN LIFE.<br/>
FOR OTHERS IT SEEMED JUST A BLABBERING WITHOUT ANY MEANING, OF COURSE!BUT WHO CARES? <br/>
I AM NOW CONFIDENT THAT ONE DAY MY CHILD CAN ALSO MAKE A GREAT SPEAKER IN PARLIAMENT!

Its like a mom praising the child for getting 30 marks instead of usual 10.<br/><br/>
Can understand if SoniaG said that. Not Journalists, or else it sounds paid news.<br/><br/>
If you call this good show will he ever get 60,or are you making fun of him <br/><br/>

                            Congress is shedding crocodile tears for poor and farmers for last 68 years. Then why poor and farmers are still living in miseries. While Gandhi family project themselves as pro poor, people appointed by Gandhi family loot the same public from behind the curtain. Indian public was sentimental for Gandhi family that's why this trick worked in past. But people are coming out of their sentiments for Gandhi family and hence this trick will not work again.

Why none of the journos, beat congress for their dynastic approach to launch a lost cause of Pappu. Yeh to aise hai ki jaise ek mansik rogi yadi has bhbi de to ek badi uplabdhi mani jati hai. Rahul ne ek speech kya de di sab journos wah wah karne lag gaye! Shame on you. When will you confess to world that you also feel that it is not farmers plight but khangress's attempt to use plight of farmers for relaunch of Rahul(version n.n) Ek budhi mareej Maa ka sapna. All we can say that Khangress has added one more sin. Look at body language of Shinde and Pilot. Trying to defend indefensible. It was Khangress rule when farmers from Vidarbha committed suicide in droves and Khangress government which did nothing. Are ek Kalavati ko gay tak nahi de paya ye Pappu. Shame on you Journos! Sold your soul to Devils who destroyed our land, spied on Netaji.

                            Rana has, yet again got it wrong.  It wasn't a solo number by RaGa, it was a group performance.  Scindia, sycophant to the core, was prompting the boy wonder with facts that RaGa finds it difficult to articulate.  Gogoi was putting in his two paisa worth.  As for Scindia's own solo performance complete with Sanskrit verses, put it this way, with his royal background, education at Doon School, followed by Stanford School of Business in the USA, a few Sanskrit verses would be, to use the well known phrase, doing what a trained monkey does.  If you look at the dictionary meaning of the phrase, it is 'some one doing an easy job'.  The point here is that notwithstanding this rehearsed performance by RaGa, the bottom line is that RaGa will still not be able to undergo an Arnab Goswami type interview without making a fool of himself, he will not be capable of having a one-to-one with world leaders such as POTUS and will not be able to stop the infiltration of vested interests to the very heart of the Congress party!  Congress Mukth Bharat is still on!!!

                            Such is the desperate need for journalists to present a counter narrative that they cannot see the incredulous stand of Rahul who urges the PM to visit the poor and spends two months sunning in Bangkok. Don't succumb to rhetoric - one 20 min speech getting this amount of coverage reflects the famished state of the press more than a challenge to the government.

                            yesterday Rahul (pappu) made one line comment and people and media did not notice because of their un necessary over enthusiasm that NDA make in india campaign will fail. what exactly he wants to say. no infrastructure should develop and will depend on other country for defense and other requirement. why we have to spend our hard earned foreign currency on other country and allow middle man to take commission. can not we develop our own defense system , congress does not want this reason known to them and many congress's for obvious reason. always good to be self dependent rather depending on others.

                            @Pravin: The writer is already a Congress spokesperson. The ploy is that she wears the garb of "investigative journalist". There are many such media persons (for example, Kumar Ketkar, supposed to be a "senior journalist") who sing praises for Gandhi and Italian families. Congress with its crores held in Swiss accounts finds it very easy to put many such "senior journalist", "social activists", "human rights crusaders" on their pay-roll.

                            @Apple: Do you first of all know what bill &amp; what ordinance Rahul is talking about? Do you know who all have worked to prepare 2013 Land Ordinance Bill? Do you know that 2013 BILL was drafted &amp; cleared through a democratic process with wide consultations in UPA, front ended by Rahul Gandhi &amp; NAC and later with opposition parties &amp; Standing Committee constituting few members from BJP. Do you know the comments of Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj etc during deliberations on 2013 Land Bill. @ Mr.Apple YOU DO NOT KNOW ANY THING THE WAY NaMo DOES NOT KNOW ANY THING ON THE LAND BILL as he was not there in picture (OR probably NaMo was not bothered &amp; hence gave no inputs in preparation of 2013 Land Bill) while the 2013 bill was being drafted &amp; passed, except for opposing it after it was cleared. ENTIRE COUNTRY KNOWS WHERE THIS OPPOSITION OF NaMo TO 2013 LAND BILL COMES FROM &amp; the same was clearly articulated by Rahul Gandhi in his parliament speech...Yeh Udyogpatiyon ka sarkar hai &amp; Suit Boot ka sarkar hai. Kudos to Rahul &amp; his young team and I wish them all the best in exposing U TURNS &amp; CHANGING NAMES and TAKING CREDIT FOR UPA SCHEMES/INITIATIVES by this NaMo led Government. It is a good beginning by Young Congress Team and they should start working on the ground with poor people/farmers/unemployed youth/small entrepreneurs etc and ROAR in parliament on anti-people initiatives of the Government. OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK SHOULD NOT BE POWER BUT SENSITIVITY TO PEOPLE'S ISSUES WHICH IS LACKING IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.

Hope he will continue with more vigour and strength.

Rahul should also focus on the BJP's tactics of releasing their hidden agendas from back door entries(Thru' controversial statements made by BJP's law makers every other day). Let's hope for the best.
