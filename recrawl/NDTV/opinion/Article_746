Headline::::The First Sign a Government is Losing Its Nerve



DateTime::::2015-08-09T21:53:00+05:30




                                In my book, one of the first tell-tale symptoms of a government losing its nerve is when it starts attacking news media.
Indira Gandhi's abuse of the press started almost a year before the Emergency and censorship were imposed. She, and her hatchet-men, held the press (only newspapers then) responsible for all the bad news about her government as India's economy collapsed under the weight of the 1971 war effort, but even more so, crushed by the sheer stupidity of the fake socialist assault unleashed by those in her charmed, crimson circle, who had all meanwhile carved out for themselves and their progeny the finest slices of real estate in what they saw as India's Kremlin: Shanti Niketan, Vasant Vihar, Sundar Nagar and so on in Delhi, while condemning the rest of us to the tyranny of the DDA, which I rather call the Delhi Destruction Authority.
Any media criticism was dismissed as capitalist propaganda against a revolutionary "garibi hatao" government shaking up the old feudal status quo. Some national newspapers were dismissed as jute, or drawing from that, predictably, 'jhoot' press. This was a pun on the fact that some of the prominent owners, including Ramnath Goenka of the Indian Express, had old jute mills in their family business portfolios. But none was spared. Capitalist was made synonymous with foreign-hand, foreign-hand with CIA, and by implication any criticism of Indira or her policies was anti-national or unpatriotic. Even the genteel Hindustan Times was made to fire its even more genteel editor BG Verghese (so genteel, in fact, that just about a year under him, and I fled to India Today, out of sheer boredom as all he wanted from the Northeast were stories on its natural fabrics, butterflies and river transport rather than the insurgencies then raging there). His "crime": daring to criticise India's integration of Sikkim within itself, which he called annexation. The annexation of Sikkim and Indira's annoyance was just before the Emergency.
Back in power in 1980, Indira Gandhi turned on the media again halfway through her term, calling it anti-national for its coverage of the Nellie killings in Assam while the Non-Aligned Summit was on in Delhi and, specifically, India Today magazine later for a major investigative story I had done, exposing Indian sponsorship of Sri Lankan Tamil rebel camps in our Tamil Nadu. This marked her government going downhill, and it would most likely have lost in 1984 but for the sympathy wave following her assassination changing everything.
Check again what Rajiv does to tell us he was losing grip? Classic old shoot-the-messenger, or at least try to. He unleashed his so-called anti-defamation bill, raided critical newspapers, orchestrated trouble by their unions, but continued going downhill. Later, even the Vajpayee government displayed the same trait, selectively attacking the media, particularly Outlook magazine, for causing it discomfort.
Even the formidable and thick-skinned The Indian Express, which I then edited, was hit by repeated visitors from CBI demanding to know the source of the so-called Judeo Tapes we had published in 2003. The ones in which the senior BJP MP and minister was seen on camera accepting five lakhs in cash making that immortal statement: "paisa Khuda to nahin, par Khuda ki kasam, Khuda se kum bhi nahin" (money is not God, but by God, it is no less than God). It took us a lot of skill, and hours spent with a very patient genius, Fali Nariman, dealing with that.
Four points thus get established beyond doubt:1. The first indication that a government is losing nerve or grip is when it starts blaming and targeting the media.2. That it never succeeds in subduing the bringers of bad news. It never could, not fully even in the Emergency. Now, with technology causing such anarchic democratisation, establishments can pretty much go to hell.3. A war on the news media causes any government terrible, often terminal, damage. It does no real harm to the media, besides some short-term pain, harassment and inconvenience. In the end, journalists emerge with heroism, enhanced by the halo of state dadagiri.4. It still doesn't stop any government from trying this. Or maybe it is just a chronic, unsuppressable basic instinct with establishments.
The latest notices by the new bully-fied I&B Ministry to news channels seeking explanation for their coverage of the Yakub hanging follows the same predictable pattern. These should be ignored. Nobody should bother explaining anything because no news media organisation reports to any government. And, media should be united.
And, also introspect. Why does the government dare to send these notices to TV channels but not to the print media, which also has sections deeply critical of the hanging, giving space exactly to the same voices that government objects to on TV? Has TV media made itself specially vulnerable to sarkari interference? Does it go to the I&B Ministry too often seeking clearances, favours, discretionary benefits? Electronic media bodies are much stronger than in print - it is well nigh impossible to collect the Editors Guild for an executive meeting for months, compare that with the efficiency of Broadcasters' Associations.
But are they only united by their commercial concerns rather than issues of editorial freedom? And if not, why did none of them make an issue when the Union Home Ministry denied security clearance to Maran-owned Sun Group's channels just because there were cases of financial impropriety against them? Whatever their crimes, this is an issue of media freedom. It slips in the notion of licensing in a diabolical, Stalinist manner. And because we don't protest, the state thinks we are scared and moves in for the kill, and even better if it can invoke national security or interest, backed by social media fascism.
Which is precisely what it is doing now. It will still fail. But we can help it fail faster by dismissing these notices with contempt, and then learning to speak out for freedom of the press for all, and not merely when we are targeted.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

                            Fantastic article by Mr Shekar Gupta... Now u wud be attacked by the bhakts or the paid writers as anti indian nationalist or a pakistani isi agent.. Or congess agent or kejriwal fan. The bhakts are the only few who still are lost in the mirage of namo... The shine of the shoes are lost and slowly it wud get torn .. Power makes any man greedy and he would slowly be thrown out by their own sycophants.

                            I second all your statements sir. The democracy of the nation is at cross roads.. When I was listening to Amit shah's speech at gaya today he was referring to Bihar governance as "jungle raj" but in fact nation is under "gundaaraj". From Banning beef in Maharashtra, external minister supporting a fugitive, vyapam scam, banning porn, hanging of yakub memon, arresting &amp; harassing adult couples to curbing the independence of media, each single action is anti democratic.. While our respected PM is busy in taking selfies, the nation is choking under despotism. Indeed a great article sir, Pls keep up the good work.

                            Shekhat Gupta, is sometimes very analytical. I think his prediction of the begining of the end of modi is right. Corruption, scams, scandals, murders, vyapam, lalit modi, fredom pf press suppression, freedom of speech of individuals, teesta seetalvad, green peace, delhi misrule through governor, changes in text books, foreign trips- begging, adani and ambani, dismissing oposition because they dont have numbers and so on and so forth. There r thousand failures and mistakes. All in just one year, all in just one year... Well done shekhar

                            Shekhar Gupta you have correctly pointed out that media should introspect : before making a terrorist a hero in TV !! You seem to learn if govt. gives you notice or people boycott watching you!! Don't think media is above national interest or it is a sign of downfall of your channel by people's choice.

                            Isn't that being a bit too rich ... coming from someone who was a part of a smear campaign against Modi for the 2002 for almost 10 ton12 years. The courts didn't find anything. How about the media being made accountable. What a miserable way to spend a life ... trying to find a fault in someone else. Sad souls.

I am all for press freedom. But the point is why question Supreme Court decision on TV debates. If all the legal luminaries had only helped Mr. Memon with their inside information &amp; legal points - he would have been saved. But no.They will not give support unless paid a fee. <br/><br/>
Again did the channels run one show highlighting the humble &amp; caring life of Mr Kalam. They could have showed a mirror to all politicians on that day by highlighting the greatness of that departed soul.<br/><br/>

                            Dear Mr.Gupta<br/><br/>
Something remarkable has happened post 1991 economic reforms. There has been a spectacular increase in the size of middle class Indians who have been largely liberated from a mai-baap sarkar. But this is not the remarkable thing that i am talking about.The remarkable thing about this middle class is that it is largely Hindu and has found its lost moorings - that of being a Hindu. This has happened in spite of the grand design of the leftist, commie secular brigade that set out to destroy the pride of India by taking over institutions of all hues and colors. The media, especially, the English Print and Electronic ones, manned by your partners in crime carries out the agenda of diminishing the civilization of this country day in and day out. They masquerade their idealogically driven opinions in the name of News and Facts. This news media think they are a law unto themselves and cry hoarse when the law is shown to them.<br/><br/>
Unwittingly, the electronic media has helped in one way - When the audience see the visuals directly, they form their own opinions and those opinions have been at a 180 degree variance with what the pseudo-secular brigade wants the people to see. When the anchors and panelists betray their hatred of Hinduism, it is very apparent on the screens of the Television. There was another development that the leftist-commie brigade did not countenance. It was the emergence of the God of Technology - the internet, which has and is making the main stream media irrelevant to a large extent. The Governments can listen and talk to its people directly, bypassing the colored visions of the so called mainstream media. The consequence of 'directly seeing the events' and the internet has ensured that the electronic media does not have any sympathies in the eyes of the people.

                            With all due respect the standards and ethics of Indian media is far below the required levels. I say this being an Indian. This includes paid news without clear demarcation and questionable bias towards certain parties or idealogies. However the government could have handled this differently by questioning media ethics and integrity to the ethics body and have let the Supreme Court send a contempt of court notice directly. Why should the Supreme Court meet at 3am to discuss this one case? There are so many cases waiting years for adjudication.

                            Rubbish!!! Why was media covering  yakub as if he was martyr? Only reason everyone is pissed off is because media makes small thing big and doesn't have any social responsibility.

                            Freedom of the media is paramount in any democracy. But the media has to be fair, impartial and honest. If it is not, then it becomes difficult to defend it. In India, there is no self regulation of the media. This results in sections of the media either going overboard or becoming corrupt like paid media. Then public opinion veers around to state regulation. The media has not only to dispense information, but ensure that correct information is dispensed. It builds public perceptions that are politically important, which reinforces the need for self regulation. And which is the reason the state tries to control it. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.

                            Yes, you are right! But this applies to press, not headlines business.<br/>
I am sorry to say that reporting about Yakub's hanging - or anything - is made too sensational by the media.<br/>
I have seen Western media for decades. Except for tabloids, most reporting is way more responsible than that in Indian media - and Indian media is rapidly losing standards.<br/>
Also, there is something called "collective responsibility". Western media doesn't stop from second guessing the government like Indian media. But they don't all talk one way, they don't shout logical arguments down, they call non-official versions of story as "theory".<br/>
Mr. Gupta, the media you defend also print/transmit astrology, for a comparison!<br/>
I, a free standing intellectual laugh on your business and your government.

                            So, you're essentially saying if anyone criticizes and held media accountable they are loosing sense. In other words media cannot be criticized! I guess indian media needs to mature enough to take criticism. Media is definitely an important aspect of democracy but it should be criticized and held accountable when required.

                            The basic question is why does the media believe it is beyond being questioned? That is the most dangerous thing and if anyone seems autocratic &amp; fascist it is the media. <br/><br/>
Why does the media feel it should not be held accountable to anything?<br/><br/>
Why any question asked of media becomes an attack on freedom of press?<br/><br/>
What is the difference between a politician who immediately gets agitated when uncomfortable questions are asked and media that screams attack on freedom of press when it's asked to be accountable?<br/><br/>
Why does media believe it is above the law?<br/><br/>
If democracy gives you freedom of speech it also gives you responsibility. Why does the media believe it is entitled to enjoy that freedom without shouldering any responsibility for its' actions?<br/><br/>
What will happen if the media answers to the notices as per law and clears its' stands? The same media demands resignations of minister's based on 'sources' which are unverified. But refuses to even answer questions despite being confronted with proof?!<br/><br/>
If you living in a democratic country then follow the law of the land. Don't believe you are beyond questions. Answer to the notice as per law and clear your name. That would be far better then resorting to 'breaking news' 'attack on freedom of press by fascist govt' and such rhetorics.

                            Unless media stops its  political bias-ness , it will suffer. Today Indian media is the most unethical entity and most dangerous for Indian democracy. It is worse than Cong+BJP corrupt and illiterate leaders. <br/>
Media should be biased but only for the welfare of common people.<br/>
Media should show whatever is the truth, let the people judge based on the facts and not be swayed by media's opinion.  <br/>
 When TV reporters/anchos/editors talk to Modi their facial expression reveals their fear in the heart. But when they talk to Arvind Kejriwal , their facial expression reveals their mind . But to impress the media bosses these interviewers try to insult Arvind Kejriwal which is not right. The common people watch and sense  every thing.  Time has come. Media should apply its own brain. You guys are not aliens. You also need a corruption free and peaceful country to live. So be sensible and bring out the truth and put your opinion with proper facts.

This govt with a massive mandate but have got their priorities misplaced, too arrogant and insensitive to people and Opposition.. Modi is always in election campaign, too brash, disrespectful and his choice of words for his opponents does not hold him in any esteem, he will be paid back for his non deliverance, jumlas, choice of Amit Shah as BJP President, does Amit Shah not look as someone from a Bollywood movie representing ???

We all saw how Pradeep Desai tried to pull out words from Saleem Khan but how gracefully Mr Khan avoided that. What was your contribution to Kashmiri pandits' plight? You the media, considered Yakop Memon's hanging more important than Dr Kalam's funeral! In the television debates, the bias of the moderators are clearly seen and how they 'stop' the arguments against their biased views.<br/>

                            To your credit, you do not take sides. You are ready to point to follies on both sides. Let me also acknowledge that Death Penalty is one of the toughest questions for any society, an issue with no easy resolution. But I strongly disagree with your view on the specific issue of Yakub Memon. Focusing on the central aspects of Memon case, it is clear now that he did more than merely acquiesce to some requests from Tiger and Co., for which he was given the death penalty, with all avenues of appeal exhausted. In effect he was not denied due process at any point. What is galling to me (and a large section of the public) is not principled opposition to Death Penalty as claimed  by some invertebrate politicians and members of press but their rather shameless, hypocritical and opportunistic political scoring even if it risked overall stability of the situation. If one threw stability aside for the sake of a larger principle, I can understand. But most of the voices were hardly the intellectual variety (they write for newspapers but does not make them intellectuals). These are the same people who eagerly covered the processions of Yakub Memon funeral. Even United States- not just in recent Bush years but also before that- frowns on such coverage and blockades many times. You should know. If you do not want to refer to US, then let's go by our standards, We simply are not ready for this kind of coverage which could inflame large sections of society. And one thing- NDTV is not a respectable straight shooter. They might deny it, you might support them but we can be fooled only so much of the time. Against this backdrop, your advice to these fellows is hardly worthy and very dangerous.

Fact is- people are really angry and disillusioned over the way a segment of our media has acted during this episode. To tell you the truth, it has resulted in an even greater loss of credibility of the mainstream media in our country and don't be surprised if people actually start cheering if the government decides to harass it- so low is the perception of the MSM today.<br/>
The MSM sold its soul to Congress after the 2009 election-  people know this and take it into account when judging matters. No amount of blitzkrieg or carpet bombing from these sections of media will do.

                            In name of media freedom you guys crossed the limit and made a terrorist hero and put judiciary system on stake. National interest comes first not media freedom

                            Comparing the past to the present misadventures of desi media doesn't add up. Time desi media aligns itself with national interests and starts covering serious issues rather than anti-nationals and traitors / extremists.

                            Pl. be open to criticism. TV and media are not above law. TV channels are united at the drop of a hat and when they face criticism.<br/>
You pl. introspect yourself on why this happened.

                            Its very hard to trust any media house nowadays. That's what the we as people of the country feel. We can easily make out when a news or reporter is being biased. My appeal to all news channels, please be neutral and you will all have our support. I am afraid if this will get posted

                            Mr.Gupta, I respect you a lot but I have to differ with you on this issue. No body is banning the media Govt is asking the reasons behind supporting a terrorist and interviewing terrorists sitting in Pak to bash India on Indian channels. Just see how you yourself called social media fascist? In the same breath can we also consider electronic media as newstraders and anti-national?

                            The best thing under the circumstances is to bring down the FII / FDI on Media houses to less than 10%. The world view will go for 180 degree turn. Anyone any doubts?
