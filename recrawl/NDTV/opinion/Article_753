Headline::::The Dirty Filthy North Indian



DateTime::::2015-08-11T22:22:00+05:30




                                So what's new about the Swachh Bharat survey of Indian cities? Nothing. Did they really need a survey to tell us that North Indian cities and towns are without doubt the dirtiest in the land (and probably in the world)? That Delhi (the part administered by the MCD - which is most of the capital) is among the country's 100 filthiest cities, joining 73 other North Indian cities in that lowly group. This conglomerate of smelly eyesores (multiple assault on senses) includes our holiest of holy - Varanasi, Allahabad, Ajmer and Amritsar. Obviously Godliness and Cleanliness are not related, or at least in the North. 
The last time I went to Vishwanath Gali in Varanasi, I ran away in disgust; I wasn't going to walk barefoot to the sacred temple, because the idea was quite revolting. The lovely Hindi word "ghin" (revulsion), describes what one felt. And what is true of the road to the temple is true of the temple, the ghats, and much of Varanasi. I could not understand people's love for this eternal city. And I am not alone on this. 
Sample this review from TripAdvisor - "We visited this temple in March 2013. To enter we had to lock our cameras in the locker and we had to take off our shoes. In the previous Hindu temples, I had no problem as it was kind of clean, but here you had to cross the street full of cow excrements and pee. In the temple itself it was not different just with that difference that there were monkeys peeing instead of cows."Why don't we feel this when we go to temples in the South? Or in their cities? Seven of the 10 cleanest cities are from the South, and 39 in the top 100. Why is it that South Indians (Madrasis, as all we Northerners disparagingly term them) manage to keep their cities and places of worship cleaner than we do? What is wrong with us? Are we just plain uncivilized (as most Madrasis would have us believe) or is there something more to it? Is it just a North Indian Hindu problem?  
It is plausible to argue that our severely caste-ridden society has basically created a people who completely lack any sense of community? We pride ourselves on our caste and our cleanliness at home - we bathe, sweep and swab the house, but the minute we step out of our domain, we don't give a damn. After all, those outside our home are not from our jaat and why should we care about them and their sensibilities? This would explain why my neighbour, who everyday hoses down his driveway, has no compunction in throwing his garbage onto the main road. Or why my other neighbour, who is building his palatial home, has covered the pavement with all sorts of building materials.
The cleanliness of Mysuru (now India's swacchest city) is attributed to a collective and community effort: the government, NGOs and people working together to keep a place clean. Compare that with Delhi. With multiple bodies looking after different aspects of the city, nothing works properly and certainly not in keeping Delhi clean. Most cities around the world have a system by which garbage is collected by the municipality from outside your doorstep and taken to the landfill in trucks designed for garbage. Delhi runs on a multiplicity of systems ranging from throwing the garbage onto the street in front of you, or into the drain nearby, or cycle carts organized by Resident Welfare Associations carrying the garbage to nearby dump. These are often located in front of market places and soon overflow with garbage. Once in a while, trucks and earthmovers arrive to load this onto trucks to carry away. Amazing! Where in the world does this happen except in India? Almost a century after Western towns streamlined garbage collection, we haven't been able to figure out what to do.
It is embarrassing when we compare ourselves to other Asian countries outside the old British India. While we all know Singapore is antiseptically clean, on the filth index, we trail almost every other Asian country without exception. Even poor Cambodia, which suffered decades of war, violence and Pol Pot's killing fields, has a better-organized garbage collection system than we do, and Siem Reap and Phnom Phen are far cleaner than Agra or Delhi. So poverty itself is not an excuse; and in any case in India, the better off are much more likely to be dirtying our towns than the poor, who have little to throw. 
And ask yourself why do these same Indians, who go abroad, suddenly become model citizens? They use dustbins, don't throw banana peels from moving vehicles, and stop flicking cigarettes onto the ground. What happens to them? Have they suddenly converted to a new religion, or is it the fear of being fined that makes them behave? My guess is the latter. Fear is probably the key. For all our North Indian bluster, the idea of being punished is not a happy thought. Unfortunately, India is a soft state, where punishment seldom happens and a little bit of hafta keeps the law in abeyance. The top clean cities of the world fine heavily for littering.
So where is the hope in the Swachh Bharat scheme? Is it in building toilets or building the mindset? Delhi got a whole host of public toilets, partly funded by foreign aid, but aside from being used as advertising kiosks, they're ignored by the city's male population which continues to urinate against any wall they feel like. 
So it has to be a change in the attitude of people. How that is achieved is the real challenge. Moralising alone is not going to work, and fining will be blocked by politicians, who fear that any punishment leads to a loss of voter support. AAP is a shining example of this belief: autowallahs no longer have to take anyone where they don't want to go, nor follow any metering system, because as the newly-ordained Brahmins for supporting AAP during the elections, they can do what they want. And as long as this attitude governs our society, we will remain a filthy mess.(Ishwari Bajpai is Senior Advisor at NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Not trying to demean any other temple or place. But if you have been to Srirangam Temple (Trichy) or Meenakshi Temple (Madurai) or Big Temple (Thanjavur) you could see vast complexes, almost scrubbed clean all around and every day. Now the roads around those temples are also maintained serenely and absolutely fit for pedestrians. I have been to the temples of Varanasi too, and I agree with the Author. Apart from the "BIG" names they carry, there is no cleanliness at all, in and around.

                            North Indians, specifically people from UP and Bihar are the worst in cleanliness. In my home city Bangalore, The problems of these north Indians is even more. They have spoilt Bangalore. Earlier Bangalore used to be a place only occupied by people from tamilnadu, Kerala and Andhra apart from the indigenous Kannada people but after the IT revolution north Indians came in huge numbers. They have set up paan shops everywhere and the local population have taken to this dirty habit.<br/><br/>
I would like to share an Incident which happened in the Bangalore Bus service. A middle aged couple entered the bus, by the looks of it one could understand that they were from a north Indian city. Sure enough i got to know that they were from UP through there language. The lady was carrying a lot of baggage's hence few people who were seated lent them the seats, after a while the man opened the window and spit onto the road without regarding the incoming vehicles on the road. Then he closed the window, then i noticed that on the window there was a sticky mucus stain on the outside  which the person had wiped it off. It was an horrible experience, since that day i have never used the BUS service. I cannot come to terms with the fact that people are so different out there and are so dirty. Bangalore has become so dirty, Bangalore seventh position came as a surprise. Now i can only imagine how dirty and filthy other cities are.

                            North India has lot of problems with regard to Cleanliness. They need clear policies on effective garbage collection and recycling that. Then they need to ban chewy tobacco, gutkha.

                            With all due respect sir, stop calling all the South Indians as Madrasees or perpetuating that name calling. I have all the respect for a Madarasee and that is not the point. A Bengali would not to be called Gujarathi and a Gujarathi would not like to called a Bihari. Respect the ethnic identities of the people. There are five distinct states in the South - Karnataka (speaks Kannada and not Kannad) ,  Andra and Telangana (speaks Telugu) , Tamilanadu (speaks Tamil) and Keral (that speaks Malayalam). Understanding others identity is part of giving respect. Thank you very much.

You can see the contrast in cleanliness by a travel in train. If you travel in the Mangala Nizamuddin express from Kerala to Delhi, after Konkan you will change your window seat.

                            i am a north Indian living in south India. Not only the outer domain, north India needs to clear the inner domain also. Once south india may be a domain of the demons, but people have a better heart than the north indians. they have preserved their culture and heritage not with pride and ego but with respect and humility and that is what have kept them down to earth and sobre.

                            I share the concerns  of so many of the South Indians. For the last three years, Kerala is seeing an in-flux of migrant workers from North. While I recognize their right to work anywhere and even appreciate the fact that Kerala require people from outside in almost all sectors for manual work, the attitude of these people towards life in general and cleanliness in particular is appalling. They lack any form of civic sense. I personally don't think it has to do with education. If someone is keen to put together a statistics on filthy language used in public discussion, North Indians will top the chart here too.

                            Can't agree with you more. Absolutely nailed it. I have been to around 11 countries including 4 in Africa. Never seen such disobedience anywhere. I feel, Indians enjoy breaking rules because it makes them feel powerful. Having denied our so called "sone ki chidiya", we enjoy breaking the rules and feel powerful. We don't find any role models either.<br/>
Heavy fine is the best way to deter the litterer. I have seen dramatic effects when someone puts God/Goddess images near such area and people fear to litter. I suggest the gov. should rope in all so called Godmen to compulsorily spread awareness about cleanliness and duties of a citizen. The fear of God's curse can only save us.

                            It all starts from the parents. If they teach their children's how to behave in public places, then this issue can be solved by one generation. And it will be followed by the next generation. However we are as a parent are loath to change our behaviour. If today we will decide we will not allow our children's to litter on the road and they also do the same. Child learns most of the things by observing mainly their parents. If they behave child also behave properly.

                            Delhi was a beautiful place when I came  seeking for a shelter 38 years back , when the Punjabi culture was more dominant. What happened in the last 10/15 years is that the vested Political Parties tried to convert it  into a Bihari  or say UP Delhi, not  that majority of the  people in Delhi wanted it that way.  Delhi is perhaps the only city state in the world  that does not enforce laws. The  last nail on the coffin of cleanliness in Delhi was put by the people of Delhi itself by electing Mr. Kejriwal. Is all open now,  footpaths are encroached, Road crossings  are encroached, filth is thrown all over, gramin sevas abuse you if you stop your vehicle on a red signal. The  Delhi Police is catching fish in the muddy waters and blame everything on Kejriwal, Kejriwal blames everything on MCD and Modi Saab and the Citizens of Delhi should blame themselves for all these chaos.

I have lived in 4 of 6 states of the south and I am currently in the North. Among the south indian states, cleanliness and sanitation, is the best in Kerala. I feel the reason is education and for which I give credit to the Church. One other factor is that few people are abysmally poor in Kerala ( may be because of land reforms). <br/><br/>
TN and AP are as bad as north Indian states as far as cleanliness &amp; sanitation goes. Karnataka &amp; Maharashtra are bit better but still lag behind Kerala by big margin. <br/><br/>
I guess that the NE states may be cleaner - reason being education and church again.

                            I am  a community  researcher from kerala .In my opinion and experience the two most uninhabitably dirtiest places in india probably in the world are unfortunately Varanasi and Rameshwaram . Both can compete with eachother on the level of dirt, poop , garbage and general civic sense of people visiting there or people living there .Unfortunately as a hindu i feel very sad that these two form the core of our civilisation and shows us in dirty poor light as smelly , uncivilised indians ...I invite those who have not gone to these places to have a visit and see for yourself .. THe rameshwaram temple is an awesome structure ,probably  one of the grandest indian temples ,but down on the floor u cannot walk without stepping and digging our fingers on dirty road side sewege mixed slurry .The road and beach sides are full ofhuman waste as a result of  open defecation by people who come to visit the temple and ghat for funeral .Refuse to take accomodation and women children and men all stay in their vans and venture out to relieve themselves at night on the beach .. This was most disgusting to see as a hindu ..This was the worst experience i had before i reached a ghat of varanasi and found black tarred water reeking with bacteria and human waste . Are we hindus disrespecting our own gods ..really sad ..

                            Mr. Bajapai, <br/><br/>
It's time North Indians stopped the word Madrasis to address South Indians, whatever may be the context. You didn't have to use the word Madrassi in this article. The world has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 70 years since independence. More north Indians are settled in Bangalore today than in Chennai. Tamilnadu, whose Capital was earlier called Madras, is just another state among  the four states of Karnataka, which together have around 25% of the country's population. Even the Madaras has changed into Chennai over the years. <br/><br/>
Mysuru is not a Madrasi town. It's in Karnataka with Kannada being the language of the majority of Mysoreans. The contribution of erstwhile Maharajas of Mysore, their town planning and model governance, are the reasons behind Mysore being India's No. 1 clean city.<br/><br/>
Of course, even cities like Mysore and Bangalore have a long way to go before becoming truly clean cities. North India has a lot of catching up to do. Good luck.

                            Ah Vishwanath Gali. I remember my trip there as a 16 year old and was shocked by the filth in this holy town. What a filthy place Varanasi. The VHP goons out there should spend their time sweeping temples first and then talk about Hindutva.

                            I guess the literacy rates too have something to do with this dichotomy, with South India being more literate than North. South Indian also tend to take various regional and national initiatives like Swachh Bharath more seriously.

                            The Big Temple in (Thanjavur, Tamilnadu) is the cleanest temple on this land of Inidia. I never seen such a cleanliness anywhere else in India. Its all about how the Govt department works. Nothing to do with Politicians.

                            Wonderful article and very nicely written. Hope the law makers are reading and hopefully they will implement hefty fine system for littering and introduce in school curriculum for kids and parents. Lousy parents are passing on bad tradition to their kids. I was in a part in Bhubaneswar and I saw one set of parents feeding their kids who was playing on slides some candy and then throwing the wrapper away at the same play area when the trashbin was just 3 meters away! Why there is no law for the park authorities to fine them Rs.1000 for littering as they are not only making a mess of the public property but they are passing on horrible value system to the next generation where their and other kids watching them learn that it's okay to litter. I wanted to tell them loud in their face "Get off my public property!" but I did not have any law backing me!

                            The problem is not North or South. The problem is enforcement of existing rules. Rules in India are no different from those in Singapore except that Singapore enforces them strictly. For example they send plain clothed policemen into a group of smokers to see if the cigarette butts are being disposed of properly or not and fine 200$ for not doing so. Singapore was dirty and filthy once but look at it now.<br/>
One could only dream of such strict implementation in India.

                            Citizens should stop associating lack of education to cleanliness. I have seen many people who are uneducated and they maintain highest standard of cleanliness .In contrast i have also seen people with good education remaining very dirty. The sole reason behind this dirty behavior, is lack of respect for country. Respect for country does not come by celebrating Independence day, republic day and reciting National Anthem,respect towards a country comes with having pride for all the public services which government provides(Streets, Parks,Transport services). In Hindu religion, we worship earth as Bhoomatha and yet we spit and defecate on her. This practice has to stop immediately. We are talking about building smart cities, a city cannot be smart and dirty at the same time.

                            It is all about habits groomed by culture of respective regions. Go to the north-eastern states and except for a few you will see disciplined population, they do not throw waste on road and even drive maintaining lane discipline and moment you come out from those states you can see indiscipline a way of life. Now comparing North and South, I vividly remember the cultural differences between northies and southies in boarding city buses, the northies throw handkerchiefs through the window to reserve a seat before boarding whereas the southies observe that astonishingly. Work in any IT company and you can observe the loud speaking northies beating their own drums and the southies working sincerely.

                            That the Vishwanath temple is absolutely filthy is not a new discovery. If you read Mahatma Gandhi's writings, he said that he was so revolted by the filth there that though he visited Varanasi several times later, he never went to the temple. I visited it about 2 years ago and found it still as filthy. Only now there is a large security contingent and multiple checks due to the terrorist threats. It is high time a law was passed to keep all Hindu temples under tight government control so that exploitation of pilgrims by priests is stopped, temple treasures are guarded, discipline is maintained and utmost cleanliness is maintained in public places of worship. Have you noticed that stampede deaths take place only in Hindu temples? Why are we in such a hurry to have a darshan of God, when all others can exercise patience? Really pitiable. We Indians are very clean in private and extremely filthy in public. We are really not civic minded or socially conscious. Also a reflection of our innate selfishness. Same goes for our temples and every other public place. Time for a change and to reform our temple laws. The temple committees in South India really take care while in the North it is a reflection of the local tolerance to every type of public filthiness. Including at temples.

And all these states are the best states in India. There is a strong correlation between development and advancement and congress rule.

                            WWith all due respect, please stop calling all South Indians as Madarasee or perpetuating such practice. There are five distinct states and 4 distinct language speaking people in the South. They respect identity as much as a Bihari or Gujarathi or Panjabi. I am sure a Punjabi would not like to be called a Bihari and a Bihari would not like to be called a Gujarathi. Distarting the identity of a person or community is not a respectful thing to do.

The problem lies in our age old beliefs and the way in which the religion is practiced. So, I feel, there is no way out. Happy dirtying in the name of practicing religion.

                            North Indian cities and towns are without doubt the dirtiest in the land (and probably in the world)? Delhi is among the country's 100 filthiest cities, joining 73 other North Indian cities in that lowly group. This conglomerate of smelly eyesores includes our holiest of holy - Varanasi, Allahabad, Ajmer and Amritsar. Obviously Godliness and Cleanliness are not related, or at least in the North.

                            A few like @subbu have stated that kerala is maintained well and not rest of south india..like TN,AP and karnatka ..Sorry to disappoint him but wish to say that it  is not at all  true..<br/>
1.Tamil nadu has topped the Domestic tourism travel list in India  consecutively for  two years..<br/>
The famous temples in Tamilnadu are very big in stature/ thousands of years old with festivals being conducted regularly and vast number of devotees visiting day to day and yet are maintained quite well ...<br/>
2.Tiruchirappali township which has the very famous very big  Sri rangam temple in Tamil nadu has come in second position in the list of cleanest cities in India ..<br/><br/>
3.Andhra pradesh also the temples like the Tirupati temple is maintained superbly with such a vast number of devotees flowing in and out daily ..<br/>
4.Other temples like Kalahasti temple etc  are also maintained well..<br/>
5. Karnatakas Mysuru has topped the list of cleanest cities in India .,and temples in Karnataka are also maintained reasonably well ..<br/>
 Coming to  kerala ..Its temples are of different nature and built in small area with tiles and wooden structures without any big gopurams and so many *praharams* (inner and outer surface areas for circumbulating) .Most Kerala temples are without much sculptural marvels and big statues ..<br/>
They are very much small when compared to the total surface area of for example Tamil nadu temples <br/>
yet not all the temples in kerala are so well maintained.<br/>
The number of devotees visiting kerla temples is also comparatively very very less except for one or two well known temples ...Even The locals themselves dont seem to visit it.<br/>
Further there are lot of muslims and( syrian) christian population in kerala.<br/>
Finally kerala is as such much less populated than rest of South indian states  with atleast one member from most  malayalis families  choosing to go to gulf or  else where in India...<br/>
.So when there are not much people.to visit no day to day festivities .and areas being small  it should not be a problem in maintaining them.<br/>
Hence the rest of the South Indian states  Tamil nadu /Andhra Pradesh/Karnataka are the real praise worthy  ones who are doing a good job inspite of so many visitors and wide area to look after ..

                            Indeed an apt article. I am from eastern India, lived for a decade in Delhi and now have settled down in Switzerland. In totality, the entire non-south Indian states suffer from this "care two hoots for public property"  syndrome.  The authors take on the nefarious caste system in India being the root cause of filth in North India and north Indian mindset, is spot on !  I see the Indian community in Switzerland are most well behaved.  The moment we go on an Indian community trip by hiring a bus - inside the bus we act exactly like we are in India - littering in-side of the bus, break queing system for the seats, etc... as we consider the bus is a "little India" and our Indian mindset gets liberated... In my delhi days, I saw frequently the Sikh community offering "Langar" free meal to poor.  Even better off people at times take a dig, as the food is of good quality. But the evening you see the entire stretch of roads littered with thermacol / plastic / leave plates... The organisers have never thought of placeing garbage bins near the serving place and ensuring people put the used plates there or the people who eat dont give a damn thing about using the garbage bin nearby.  Because, they know the next morning the "Jamadar" the sweeper of a "lower caste"  guy  will come and clean the street...so why do we care !! This is the attitude.   What is needed is a  massive awareness campaign and creative advertisement, by someone like Prasoon Joshi or Prahlad Kakkar, like the "road idiot" ads...will hit the filthy rich, filthy mided rich of Delhi hard below their belt to give up these filthy attitude.  Massive and strategic campaign with Municipalities, residential welfare awareness building , etc can see the non-south Indian states come close to south India and then can compete with a country like Cambodia... Otherwise your Swachh Barat Abhiyan will go for a toss, like the flying used plate at a Langhar...:-)

                            Well the scene isn't much different in Bangalore, which to the angst of most of us featured on the list! Men continue to urinate in public, garbage is thrown everywhere even the neighbours house probably.

                            South Indian temples are definitley well maintained..Infact South Indian temples are more difficult to maintain because many of them are  vast in area ..yet the authorities maintain it quite well.<br/>
But still even some Indian temples and in general south Indian cities can be easily  maintained even more cleanly <br/>
In general common south Indian people are far more educated than common North Indian people and hence they know to some extend the importance of cleanliness.<br/>
I am sorry to say that I have observed that some of the North Indians even high class ones ....come to temples without even bathing or atleast wearing a neat dress even while going to temples  and they tend to chew Paan and worst is spit it anywhere they wish .<br/>
,and also lot of in between brokers and touts are there in some famous north indian temples for performing poojas and ther is no receipt  issued for payment made to them ..These things alos need to be regulated

                            We forgot to mention the lazy, aggressive citizens of Bombay, now Mumbai who throw filthy,smelly water ,and garbage from their chawls, or apartments on people walking on the road, when asked why they threw it on us, they yelled back "tere  baap ki sadak nahi hai"(this is not your fathers road, why you did not walk on the other side.When my friends went to the police station to complain,the constable told him you people come for a few days from abroad and want to change the habits of the citizens here, enjoy your holidays and go back the  people here wont change their habits for you.

                            Rightly said Mr Bajpai. It is all about arrogant and selfish attitude of people in north. And you rightly pointed towards the political willingness, its no more a secret that this politician will compromise with any thing to be in politics and power. God bless wIndians.

                            Leave alone temples etc.,  You see the state of cleanliness in New Delhi&amp; Haz. Nizamuddin Railway stations;  You can't wait on the plat forms not even for 10 minutes because of filthy smell you have to bear.<br/><br/>
May I humbly request the Rly minister to visit New Delhi Rly station in disguise and see the state of cleanliness you found.  At least make capital's Prime Rl;y station bearably clean/neat.<br/><br/>
May I wait for a few months to here from Suresh Prabhuji?

                            I have been to several north indian states, the last thing i want to visit is a temple. The only footwear which protects us from all the filth around us is stripped and definitely cannot imagine walking barefoot on those spit and filth wetted roads.

                            North indians especially from Bihar, UP, MP, DELHI are worst, they are very rude, if anybody tells them not throw garbage they don't mind beat you up. lot of rowdism is there in them. Bangalore was clean much better than present but because lot of north indians coming for IT jobs they have made it dirty it.  this bimaru states never improves nor their people attitude.

                            It is not about the "fear" of law, when an North Indian goes abroad.The law is more or less the same in India. It is a fear that he will not get anyone to bribe, when caught, which make a north Indian  behave properly in foreign countries. Take them to a SAARC country ... they will merrily spit and spray all around them. It is only when they reach a country where they know, bribery does not work, that their fears come out in the open.<br/>
Implementation of law is the only challenge in india

                            It unfair to compare our cities with developed countries. Even today Colombo and Dhaka are cleaner than Indian cities.After traveling around the world in most of the countries we are far behind developing countries in general cleanliness. We need to introspect and author is right to say we damn care for cleanness and it has become our part of 'chalta hai'    culture.

                            True! Unless the mindset changes, cleanliness will not come. In abroad, it's not that the places are cleaned every minute, rather nobody throws trash on road to begin with.

                            A thought provoking article written with enough facts than fictions.I believe our PM is listening to his own intitiative of swatch barath.It is a shame to note that his own constituency Varanasi is the filthiest city and not to talk of our metro cities. It is the mindset of the people which make a place clean.North indian mindset itself is full of corruption and is reflecting in thier surrounding as well.I believe those north indian who travel to places like Tirupathi ,Madura, Zrirangam, Trivandrum , Guruvayoor or many of the temple towns in karnataka which are kept very clean.Almost all the north indian temple towns are the dirtiest places and even the temples are stinking but the priests are more busy in making money. It is shame on the entire north indians .

    I hope you would have read philosophy. When you have destination fixed and <br/>
you start moving in the direction you will end up reaching your destination <br/>
directly proportional to the mind elevation. It is true. So far for fifty years <br/>
proxy and lame government which was ruling could not think much beyond dividing <br/>
the people and eating out of it. First of all responsible can you write series <br/>
of articles to educate the NDTV editorial boards to have vision of seeing India <br/>
in its whole form. Not within the ambit of 1200 years only.<br/><br/>
Thou art that. Be clear in what you say otherwise you will become whom you are canvassing <br/>
all over.

                            Temples in Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat and South India are much cleaner than those in North India. But still there is a lot more to do.

                            I am proud of the fact that My city Navi Mumbai ranked third in the list and yes I can see the difference when I travel to Jaipur and Delhi for work. Cities of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are as filthy as those of UP and Bihar. That is my personal experience.

                            In India, probably less so in the South from my personal experience as well as the author's, we take pride in dodging civic laws or norms to litter our streets. Everyday in our locality, myself and a few other citizens have been playing a cat-and-mouse game with habitual litter-bugs. They take the garbage out of their home in plastic bags, and dump it on the road or pavement when no one is looking. This filth is soon spread apart by street dogs and crows (and huge rats at night!). I don't blame the municipality, whose sweepers do their job by (at least) sweeping the streets clean in the morning. The garbage trolls appear after the sweepers have left, almost deliberately, and as if in a cunning, sadistic ritual do their 'thing'. Unfortunately, in our area at least, those who do this are workers in people's homes, who do not live here, and instead of carrying the bag to the local garbage vat, they dump it on the roads or pavements. Sometimes the house-owners are even unaware of, or oblivious to how their own filth is destroying their neighborhood.

                            I agree with the writer. We north Indian are uncivilized. We will like to flout all traffic rules, spit anywhere we wish, our temples are dirtiest one. We always think it is government responsibility to clean. Recently i went to Ho Chi Minh not a city of developed world but they also have kept it neat and clean. I am losing hope earlier i used to think probably education will change the game but even the most educated people flout all these and feel happy ready to fight if someone points to them
