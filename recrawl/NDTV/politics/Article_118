Visakhapatnam:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the Indian Ocean Region is one of the key areas of his foreign policy and all nations should join hands to ensure maritime stability.  India, he added, will host the first Global Maritime Summit in April this year, while addressing the International Fleet Review in Visakhapatnam today.
"Since the days of the Indus Valley Civilization, India has maintained an extensive network of maritime links. The Indian Ocean Region is one of my foremost policy priorities," he said.Indian Ocean region has become a key strategic area in view of China's growing influence in the region.
With an eye to developing relationships at key points around the Indian Ocean - the Persian Gulf, the Malacca Strait and southern Africa -- India has been cultivating security relationship with Madagascar, Mozambique and Seychelles.
India is also developing closer ties with Mauritius - the entry point to the Atlantic Ocean and therefore of immense geo-strategic value - which involves defence and trade among other things.
But explaining the broader focus on oceans, PM Modi said oceans were critical for global energy security as over 60% of world's oil production moves through sea routes. "At the same time, oceans are lifelines of global prosperity. They present us with enormous economic opportunities to build our nations," he added.
"Our approach is evident in our vision of "Sagar", which means "Ocean" and stands for - Security And Growth for All in the Region," he said.
Underscoring the importance of preserving peace on high seas in view of the threat of piracy, he said, "Threat of sea-borne terror, of which India has been a direct victim, continues to endanger the regional and global peace and stability."PM Modi was the chief guest at the International City Parade in Visakhapatnam, held on the lines of the Republic Day Parade. The Ramakrishna Beach witnessed two events -- Operational Demonstration and International City Parade.
The 30-minute Operational Demonstration showcased multidimensional tasks undertaken by the various arms of the Indian Navy, which warships, submarines, aircraft and Marine Commandos participated.

                            Was any thing new said? Most of the crude is move through oceans as that is the cheapest form of transportation and also because there are no choices. India must look at increasing the sizes of ships that ferry crude to India and simultaneously develop port facilities to handle Very Large Crude Carriers. Nothing seems to have happened in regard to importing natural gas from Burma which will add to energy security and also keep one of the neighbours in economic engagement with benefit to both. Time now is to act and act quickly

                            wah bhai wah... Mr Know-it-all. They chased away most able and intelligent people like Amartya Sen and Kakodkar. We do not have visionaries to formulate long-term solid policies for the benefit of the nation and beyond.

                            Discover channel. What watching it everybody gets a good sleep. That's it. People got fooled a big time for sure. All prices are increasing, only companies are benefitting. Rupee is all time low. Though crude oil is 70% low in price, then also government is not working properly and prices are just shooting high.
