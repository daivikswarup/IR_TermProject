Palamu, Jharkhand:                             Controversy is growing over the killing of 12 suspected Maoists on the night of June 8 in Jharkhand's Palamu district.The security forces have claimed that 12 Maoists were gunned down in an encounter. But questions have been raised on whether there was an encounter or whether the men killed were Maoists. Reports even suggest that five of the deceased were children below the age of 18.Only seven of the 12 bodies have been identified so far. One of the deceased was found to be a top Maoist Commander in the area, the rest did not have any police records.The family of the Maoist Commander have claimed the rest of the deceased were relatives, who were not involved in Maoist activities.The Jamia Teachers' Solidarity Association has questioned why a First Information Report was not filed immediately in the case. It demands that the officers involved in the encounter prove that they fired in self-defence in course of investigation.The association also alleges that there is police pressure and interference in passing off the dead persons as Maoists.Jharkhand Police spokesperson and additional director general  SN Pradhan said the process of identification of the other bodies is on.He also questioned if those killed were innocent, why they were travelling with a top Maoist Commander in a jeep full of arms. The spokesperson also refused to comment on children being killed in the encounter.

                            Bhakts have argument, for national interest and India's development, some sacrifice people have to give. These are minor issues, major issue of terrorism is being tackled. After 5 years BJP rule there would be zero corruption and zero terrorism. Ram rajya will prevail in India.

                            What are the chances that people accompanying the moist commander were not involved in moist activities? Just because the bodies cannot be identified does not mean that the people killed were innocent. Such rumour-mongering will not help in boosting the morale of our security forces.

                            Naxal are nuissance and large problem than Kashmir terror given their reach and spread across 6-7 states. There are genuine grivenaces of these people which need to be addressed and include their fear of losing land and thier identity. There is need for better communication, right kind of development after taking them into confidence. But also need a tough action against some section of this movement who have turned it into enterprise to make money (they take money from contractors, villagers) and political power (align with politician to win election). They need to be dealt with force as is done now. <br/>
As it goes, there are NGOs and organisation who will cry foul when maoist are killed but not when police and government officials are brutaly killed. When Schools and Hospitals are closed or bombed. When train tarcks are blasted to kill inncocent passengers.
