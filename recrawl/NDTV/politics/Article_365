New Delhi:Â HighlightsOpposition attacks government in house over Vijay Mallya leaving India
Ghulam Nabi: This govt is part of the conspiracy in Mallya fleeing India
Union Minister Rajiv Rudy hit back saying 'Mallya not a saint for us'
                                Liquor baron Vijay Mallya's departure, possibly to the UK, in the middle of attempts to recover hundreds of crores in unpaid debts to banks, became a new point of conflict in Parliament today.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the government of allowing Vijay Mallya, "who stole 9,000 crores, to run away from India." Speaking outside Parliament, he repeated his "Fair and Lovely" jibe at the government's amnesty scheme for tax defaulters.
His party aggressively targeted the government in both houses of Parliament.
"This government is part and party in the criminal conspiracy in him fleeing the country," charged Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Rajya Sabha.
The government yesterday told the Supreme Court that Vijay Mallya went abroad on March 2. The court was hearing the petition of 17 banks which had said that Mr Mallya should be stopped from leaving India because of the enormous debts that his grounded Kingfisher airlines owes.
Mr Azad said: "When so many agencies were interrogating him, why wasn't he arrested, why wasn't his passport taken away? He is a tall and well-endowed man and travels with a whole cavalcade. How can he disappear?"
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley retorted that the Congress, which was in power for 10 years till 2014, never took any steps to recover the loans.
"The banks are taking all steps to recover every paisa taken from them," Mr Jaitley said. He questioned how cricket tycoon Lalit Modi left India despite being wanted in corruption cases.
"You could not stop him or arrest him. I can share the details. This will require a lot of introspection on your end," said Mr Jaitley.
In the Lok Sabha, Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy shot back: "Vijay Mallya is not a saint for us. There are huge debts and money he has to pay back. Has a single penny been given by NDA government? All which has gone was given by UPA government."
As the Ishrat Jehan case was raised by the ruling BJP, Congress members led by Sonia Gandhi walked out of the Lok Sabha.

                            These loans were availed and became irrecoverable well before the BJP came to power. While the Banks should have taken care to move the courts to stop Mallya or impound his passport, Azad's charge is ridiculous. It is 'his' Congress  Government which allowed this wound to fester for TEN years and he is self righteously shouting NOW? Parliament is in session from 23rd Feb. Mallya left on 2nd March. Why did not Azad save the country by shouting earlier, when it was well known that the Banks are moving the courts ?

                            This mutual recrimination serves no purpose. The government should cancel his passport and get him extradited from whichever spider hole he has crawled into. Like Iran and China, it is high time that India introduced the death penalty for serious financial crimes. That the NPAs of PSU banks is a mind boggling Rs. 3.5 lakh lakh crores is unacceptable. Those responsible have to pay, whether businessmen, politicians or bank officials. No wonder bank credit never reaches the poor, whether student, farmer, laborer or small trader. And you wonder why India remains poor?

                            It is true that he was given loan when UPA was in power .But present government  is supposed to act swiftly and strongly . It was their duty to arrest him and recover loan from him . Congress has lost moral right to ask the question , but people are asking you why you let him go ?

                            How did he go away on 2nd March 2016 when enough heat, on account of his company, had been generated at least three weeks before his alleged departure? It is one thing to keep pointing at the Congress vis-a-vis Lalit Modi for whom many in the present government had , on record, lent support on flimsy grounds. In case of Mallya and a few other cases including that of Kanhaiya , this government seems no different than the previous coalition government

                            Cannot rule out political conspiracy and complicity in helping him leave the country. Ultimately fingers will be pointed at the various investigating agencies since none have raised the issue of seizing his passport. <br/><br/>
However it is surprising for such an extravagant to leave the country just to evade Rs 9000 Crore. I think the figure is understated or underestimated. Should be much more than this.

                            Mr Atlas Ramachandran has once ranked among the "100 most powerful Indians in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council)". His problems began after more than a dozen banks in Dubai complained to police that his group had defaulted on loan repayments. His requests for bail had been rejected several times. The 74-year-old businessman from Kerala, had been in police custody since August 2015 after cheques for 34 million dhirams issued by his group bounced. In November, a Dubai court sentenced him to three years in jail. In India, bad debts have caused the NPAs in PSU Banks to reach an all time High. The Nation expected Modiji would do something on Money Laundering Shell companies. Bhakts will ask why was this not done in 60 years. Yes thats why Congress faced demise. Sushma Swaraj had caught on the wrong foot when she helped Lalit Modi on humanitarian ground. LaMo had a blue corner notice against him, but the Modi Govt has so far NOT taken any action against Vijay Mallya

                            Too much of trust begets a thudding fall of flop ! Mallya cannot be singled out for the tall height of financial misadventure - Banks aided him progressively with full support and all the Chairmen of concerned Banks must be together hauled up mercilessly for strict punishment.

                            The news is that there has been a 'lapse' and so Mallya could flee the country. Nothing like that has happened. There's no way Mallya could have left the country without the complete support of the government. It seems that the BJP is no more saintly than the corrupt congress. Naqvi is reported to have said that the government will not let Mallya live in peace. Was the government sleeping all these months and now resorts to grandstanding after the defaulter has fled? Speaking of it, how difficult should it be to issue an Interpol red-corner notice against Mallya? It is clear that the congress and BJP are hand in glove in this matter.

                            MHA &amp; FinMin once learnt that about the financial scam of Mallaya could have taken a covert action to block his egress from land,sea and air. It is a mystery as the party which always was critical to Quatrrochi (Bofors) and Anderson (Bhopal) both by Congress and Rajiv Gandhi could allow an air gap for Mallaya to escape. Theoretically people like Mallaya always contribute to the party funds of all political parties BJP,Congress etc. Spilling his guts would create a dent in the "Holier than Thou" attitude of all the political parties. In the end it is the common man who was taken for a ride.

                            Two wrongs do not make aright. If UPA did not take any action when banks had come to now of his defaulter status under NDA also no prompt action was taken. Whole country knew that Kingfisher Airlines is inoperative and owes millions to the banks under FM. Why is he trying to justify the mistake? Every detail is appearing on business pages of our dailies. How can a defaulter slip away without being noticed?

                            This is quite sad state of affairs. The unsecured loans were given to Mallaya et al by remote-controlled regime of Mohammedan Singh and he started defaulting half a decade before BJP/NDA was elected. Is RaGa so ill-informed that he is raising the issue in the hope that memories are short and press will take his side regardless? Whatever the reason it is clear that those who thought RaGa, may not have been great orator, intellectual or original thinker, is at least upright and honest will be disappointed his petty politics.

                            Most of the comments are not from people with Banking background. The Loans to Mallya was not a single shot finance  and it has a story of 2-3 decades. All Banks did not join at one time, and<br/>
the consortium of bankers as on date had happened with the full knowledge of the finance ministry and the defects in the proposals as well as shortcomings in the proposal were also part of the<br/>
decision taking. The loans have not become bad overnight, it is a matter of almost one decade of the decay of the credibility of the airline!Merely by arresting a Large borrower and  barring him from even negotiating with others in the financial sector, may not draw any benefits for the<br/>
lenders already in problem. Comparing with small borrowers treatment with extremly large borrowers<br/>
is like giving same medicine to FLU and CANCER!We should not forget that the people who are accusing the current Govt, mainly the Ministers and leaders in the past Governments were once<br/>
running behind Mallya and family for many many things, and when Mallya became a problem, those people call him names and accuse the Gate keeper for letting the Thief OUT!<br/>
Where was the proper assessment when 9000 Crores wewre dumped on a small airline by one consortium which in reality means 17 banks owned by SINGLE Owner (Practically single lender).<br/>
Putting all eggs in one basket, when all eggs also belonged to one  person(GOVT)?
