DateTime::::2016-03-09T09:35:10+05:30



Islamabad:                             Pakistan today confirmed that it had shared intelligence with India on possible terror strikes in Gujarat and other parts of the country on Maha Shivratri festival.
Pakistan Interior Minister, Chaudhry Nisar Khan told the the Pakistan Senate yesterday that around 10 to 15 terrorists have entered India from Pakistan.
Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs, said that the confirmation establishes Islamabad's commitment towards fight against terrorism."Sharing of intelligence among various nations of the world is a routine practice and this happens around the world. However, this time it was somehow leaked to media. But this showed Pakistan's commitment to fight terrorism," Mr Aziz said.
According to media reports, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Lieutenant-General Naseer Khan Janjua had passed on the intelligence warning to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval on Saturday following which the special forces were deployed to Gujarat to back up state police.
The terror alert prompted massive mobilisation of state police personnel and the National Security Guard.
Security was beefed up at prominent temples, markets, railway stations, bus stands, malls, airports and other crowded places across cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Vijayawada, Bhopal and Chandigarh.

                            OK good. What about garbage burning issue which is killing hundreds of Indians daily? Why government is not acting on this? A new law should be enacted which should ban burning of garbage. Go and visit all villages, small towns, people do burn garbage daily. Do something about it, we r dying of smoke and dust it's creating. Jai hind. Namashkar.

                            PM Lynched...Yes u r a Joker...the only people who got lynched were those in Gujarat when the PM was CM.Feel sorry and sympathy for them. Stop associating the word Lynching to criticizing PM.It hurts the family and memory of actual people lynched in riots<br/><br/>
"I haven't seen a PM getting lynched in any country......media" looks like the only country u have been in your whole life is India. All over the world PMs,Presidents,Rulers...get criticized and even worse, overthrown or assassinated (including our former PM). Hope u get the chance to broaden your horizon by getting to travel outside your town, mingle in different circles and read something different from your usual party garbage.It will benefit u as well as the society, even though I'm not keeping much hope<br/>
(PS: Also look up the word "Rational". For someone who associated the word Lynched above,I don't think you have a clue.) Bless

                            I wonder if this is real intelligent information or just a gimmick to convince people and government of India by Pakistan that Pakistan government is sincere. Only time will tell. I am sure Indian intelligence will have the information who these people are. ISI must have given the names of the people who want to attack. This is a big question mark and I am sure nothing will come out of this. This is an exercise between India and Pakistani government to deceive people of both country.

                            There were some idiots not ready to believe this fact and think everything reported by the govt is fake news ax nd intended to divert attention!! Morons!!!! Because of such thinking I think India will never prosper. No country will bash their own prime minister as much as we do. You guys have a problem with everything that the govt does.

                            Is this the right hand giving intel to India and left hand instructing terrorists? So that they can officially claim cooperation with India and save themselves from any respo.It should better not like that. But the problem is one can not have faith/believe regarding Pak.
