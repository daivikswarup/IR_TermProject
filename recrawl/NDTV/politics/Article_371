Headline::::New Price Formula For Undeveloped Gas Finds Cleared By Union Cabinet

New Delhi:Â                             In a boost to firms like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Reliance Industries, the Cabinet today approved a new price formula for their undeveloped gas discoveries in difficult areas, which will lead to a near-doubling of rates.
While domestically-produced gas is currently priced at an average of rates in gas-surplus countries like the US, Canada and Russia, for deep-sea discoveries yet to be developed, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a price indexed to cost of alternative fuels -- naphtha and fuel oil as well as imported Liquefied Natural gas (LNG). Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that the price will be the lowest of weighted average of fuel oil and imported LNG or weighted average of fuel oil, naphtha and imported coal.
With the current rates, the price of gas will come to USD seven per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).
Gas price in India is currently at USD 3.82 per mmBtu, which will fall to USD 3.15 in April, a rate not enough to make up for the cost of deep-sea development.
Since this rate is not enough to incentivise exploration, the government approved the new price formula for undeveloped gas discoveries in deep-sea, ultra-deep sea and high-temperature, high-pressure areas using average of landed price of naphtha, fuel oil and LNG, he said.
About two dozen discoveries of the state-owned ONGC, Reliance Industries and the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) in KG Basin alone are languishing for want of right price.
"The new price will apply to undeveloped gas discoveries and not on currently producing fields," Mr Pradhan said.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2016-17, had announced a two-stage gas pricing freedom. "India is blessed with rich natural resources, including oil and gas. However, their discovery and exploitation has been below our potential," he had said in his Budget speech.
With near stagnation in domestic production and consequent rapid increase in imports, "the government is considering incentivising gas production from deep-water, ultra-deep-water and high-pressure, high-temperature areas, which are presently not exploited on account of higher cost and higher risks," he said.
"A proposal is under consideration for new discoveries and areas which are yet to commence production, first, to provide calibrated marketing freedom and second, to do so at a pre-determined ceiling price to be discovered on the principle of landed price of alternative fuels," Mr Jaitley said.
The Economic Survey, too, had rooted for market-determined arm's length pricing for domestic gas.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

                            New price  based on LL--Formula which means Legitimate--Loot Formula for Ambani who gave NOTES  which will ultimately be passed onto consumers who gave VOTES. NOTE(R)gets back in multiples but hapless VOTER? There would not have been a new formula unless there is no PRIVATE PLAYER.<br/>
If there is one thing which Congress too support govt is there which is nothing but LL--Formula.

                            Excellent Job done by GoI, MoP&amp;NG and the current establishment. If India takes decisions in such sincerity, then definitely "Acchhe Din" will come. Well Done!
