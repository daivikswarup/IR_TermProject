Headline::::Chasing Vijay Mallya, From London To His 'Secret' Country Home



DateTime::::2016-03-10T10:13:01+05:30



London/Hertforshire, England:                             The world's most famous can be seen at the Madame Tussauds wax museum on Baker Street in the heart of London. Two buildings away is the home of industrialist Vijay Mallya.
He has not been seen recently at this home; the Supreme Court has asked for a notice to be sent to him through the Indian Embassy in London believing he has been in the UK since March 2.
The court issued notice to Mr Mallya yesterday on a petition by 17 banks to stop him from leaving India over the massive debt owed to them by his grounded Kingfisher airlines. The government, however, told the court that he had already left last week.The amount owed by his company is around 9,000 crores, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the court.
Mr Mallya's "secret" country home in the UK was difficult to hunt down without an exact postal address.
 
'Ladywalk', Mallya's country home, is the biggest bungalow on Queen Hoo road.
But at the Tiwen village in Hertforshire, about an hour away from London, his fame served as a good guide.
Most locals know where Mr Mallya lives. "He visits the local pubs regularly. Even yesterday a lady in a Black Audi car with 'Force India' written on it was here to meet him. I can tell when he is in town because there is a buzz around he moves around in several fancy cars. His house is among the biggest in our county." said a villager.
Mr Mallya had several visitors in the last two days at this country home, the villagers noted.
"Ladywalk" is the biggest bungalow on Queen Hoo road. It is spread over 30 acres, barricaded with metal gates wall to wall and is more contemporary than Victorian, with CCTV cameras at the entrance.
The staff at the bungalow initially indicated that Vijay Mallya was in. But on learning that a media crew was asking, they clammed up and said Mr Mallya wasn't there.
State-of-the-art interiors and a battery of expensive cars accessorize the bungalow in the quiet, verdant English village. At the 'White Horse' pub a few meters away, the staff shared that 'VJ' (Vijay Mallya) is a regular. "The last time he was here not long ago, he came as part of a big group of young girls and two young men," said an employee.
Though he remains an Indian citizen, Mr Mallya, a Rajya Sabha member, has been a UK resident for almost 28 years.
On Monday, on a request from creditor banks, the court blocked a $75 million or Rs. 515 crore settlement between Mr Mallya and Diageo, which requires the businessman to step down as chairman of United Spirits.
But it has emerged that more than half of a $75 million (Rs. 515 crore) settlement due to Mr Mallya from the British firm Diageo has already been paid.

                            With all the delay caused to stop him from Leaving India such a waste of time and now chasing him in the unknown area. He may not return back to India forever. He seems to have enjoyed the life with all the loans he got from the 17 Banks that is enough for his life time and his generations to follow..

                            He always seems a step beyond the grip of the government guys.  Reason being that this runaway has lots of "friends" who are willing to do him a good turn for a consideration --in politics and in the bureaucracy. It would not be surprise if he has 'friends' even within the top guys of the concerned banks who warned him of impending disaster. Now let the court seize his one-fifth assets in India as the Attorney -general Mukul Rohatgi claimed and catch his son who is playing in Bollywood and damn the rules!!.Two can definitely play the game.

                            During 2008 to 2013, Congress and NCP help loot the PSU Banks, and all these industrialists become billionaires from millionaires. And RaGa always blaming 2 years old Govt for everything. NDA/BJP not taken utmost care to take speedy actions on Mallya. So, all leaders are same when question of public money is there.

                            It is not mistake the Vijay Mallya,It is mistake of Bank Officials and Politicians,How can give that much amount without security if any common man wants to take loan from the bank even 10,000 rupees also these so called bank bureaucrats,they can make so many things for sanctioning the loan.How they will give,and how our political administration tolerate this things.This is clearly shows how our system works for benefit of some individual persons only.

                            He has fled and govt can do nothing. All those who aided him (bank and govt officials, politicians) can be prosecuted by SIT instituted by the Supreme Court and put behind bar. This could prevent future Mallyas

Who is accountable for the 50,000 Cr plus sunk in Air India/Indian Airlines?

                            We have Subrarata Roy of Sahara languishing in Tihar jail for defaulting payment to investors. Mallya is enjoying his life in the UK after fooling the banks. Both are very well connected politically but the treatment is different one is in jail and the other has flown the country. It is the SC which is handling both the cases and it came down heavily on Subrata Roy confining him to Tihar jail for more than a year. But in the case of Mallya the SC is not even summoning him but sending a notice seeking his views. is it because he is an MP? Why is this anomaly?

                            It is eye opening for institutes like,IIM-Ahmedabad. They invited Vijaya Mallya for Convocation and to teach management lessons to students. What lesson one can learn from fraud. Similarly, IIM-A called Lalu Prasad Yadav. Was it to teach scam?  Such prominent institutes should apply their brain, while inviting any guest.

                            I had taken house building loan of Rs. 5.0 lakhs from SBI. Bank took six months to sanction it and atleast half a dozen time they called me to meet their six different officers, inspite they were knowing that I am a central government employee. Every time officers directed me to submit different kind of documents and interestingly they had already granted loan for the same building to other applicants and still they were so causious to verify the genuinity of the building and applicant as well. I appriciate their effort so that bank can get back thier money with interest in time, afterall it is tax payer's money. But I believe that same exercise they do not do while giving loan to the people like Vijay Mallya. Therefore, severe punishment should be given first to the bank officers, otherwise, this same tradition will go on in our country.

                            Years of sponsoring vijay mallya by the CONGRESS has led to this situation. The UPA has created this and are fully liable.Its onvious they were hand in glove. <br/>
The present govt appears to be doing something. But results must accrue. I will believe from results.<br/>
I expect NDTV to blame bjp and not the congress altogether.

                            China's Solution To Tyrannical economy-wrecking ignominous billionaire class is Execution. Last year China executed a mining tycoon, billionaire gangster as part of anti-corruption drive. Iran recently awarded death sentence to business man for corruption. Mallya ran away without paying salaries, service tax, Airport Taxes etc????  This cannot happen without timely help from Govt Officials and politicians. Get a red corner notice and get him and LalitModi arrested and extradited. The City of London is sovereign entity and are NOT part of the host country, with their own laws. It is a county within London where the local Money Changers (KID RAPISTS) reside. It is also colloquially known as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi in area. We dont need politicians willing to provide humanitarian assistance. we need moral and strong men like andrew jackson and thomas jefferson who had opposed rothschild financial tyranny. Mallya is having close connections with trillionaire money changers in Swiss Banks who had become the masters of many nations of the world

                            All bank officers who have sanctioned Mallya's loan should be arrested and put in jail for negligence in their duty. Collusion of bank officers and loan takers must be stopped urgently.
