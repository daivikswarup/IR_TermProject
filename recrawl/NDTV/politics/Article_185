Amritsar:                             A Pakistani intruder was today shot dead by Border Security Force (BSF) when he crossed into Indian territory during early hours today and refused to surrender before the troops patrolling the Indo-Pak border.
A BSF official said that the Pakistani intruder entered the Indian territory through DRD Border Out Post (BOP) falling in the Ferozepur sector.
    
The intruder was repeatedly asked to surrender but he kept marching towards the troops who were on night patrol. The BSF personnel then opened fire, killing him on the spot.
     
A mobile phone with a Pakistani sim was found near the body.

                            Story does not make sense. It is not human nature to continue walking knowing that you'll be shot. In all probability they probably killed one of their own thinking he was Pakistani. By not listening to your soldiers he was telling them that I am not Pakistani.
