New Delhi:                             Coming out in support of filmmaker Karan Johar for his remarks on intolerance, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday appeared to take a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that only "one person" can talk about his "mann ki baat".
"Karan Johar right. Only one person in this country can publicly talk about his mann ki baat. No one else can do that," Mr Kejriwal tweeted.
Referring to protests in FTII in Pune, Hyderabad University among others, the AAP chief said that students across the country are "angry" with the the Prime Minister."Students across the country are very angry with Modi ji -FTII, Hyd Univ, IITs, posting RSS people as VCs, ABVP goondaism," he tweeted.
Mr Johar had kicked up a storm with his remarks about freedom of expression being the biggest joke in the country on the inaugural day of the Jaipur Literature Festival on January 21.
"The talk about freedom of expression is the biggest joke I believe in the world. Democracy is the second biggest joke I think...I really wonder how are we really democratic? How is there freedom of expression? As a filmmaker, I feel bound at every level be it what I put out on celluloid or what I say in print," Mr Johar had said.

                            Now Karan Johar and AK should be sent to Pakistan.<br/>
BJP is very democratic party. It is not only run by PMO but views of student leaders and street goons are also supported by its top leaders.

                            I apperciate  his speeches too. talking nice and relevant thing can be a big quality of any politician. but problem is his speeches and action doesnt match. if he trust people like amit sha , smiriti irani, uma bharti, arun jaitly then i cant trust him. his team and his ground support like rss and abvp shows what kind of man he is. i apperciate him as a good politician. he understand the public of india and their emotion. most of our public are emotional fools, he is using his man ki bat and speeche to make us fool like nehru , indira did for years in india.

                            Kejri seems to be the only leader common man trust. He seems to have done a good job in Delhi. Unfortunate to rest of India, AAP seems to be reluctant for big expansion. Fact is the India was a racist country and still is, but slowly reducing the caste barriers. but recent events gives the picture that not taking strong action against racist people can reverse this progress in month which took years to develop.

                            It happens only in India ... everybody talks whatever they want to and then say that there is no freedom of speech, there is no tolerance, democracy is threatened etc. etc. I mean ... come on ... if there was no freedom of speech or no democracy then you wud have been jailed as it happened under Indira Gandhi. This highly educated and intelligent person is making himself a fool in front of everybody.

                            Employee tells boss ... there is a lot of intolerance in India under Narendra Modi, i want a transfer. Boss replies ... OK, we have vacancy in Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, Afganistan, Somalia, Nigeria etc.. Employee immediately replies ... No No i am OK here. Hence before all these people who are crying hoarse over intolerance must do a reality check for themselves. India is the most tolerant country in the world and this is not going to change however hard these hypocrite jokers like RaGa, AK, SRK, KJ, Kejri etc. cry. Why did the award wapsi stop suddenly immediately after bihar election results were out ? Did India suddenly become tolerant after the bihar elections. People are quite capable of seeing through the false propaganda unleashed by Congress and their cronies.
