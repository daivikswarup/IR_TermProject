Agra:                             Images of mass cheating that shamed Bihar last year have been replayed in Uttar Pradesh, where visuals from Class 12 board exams held last week in Agra and Mathura show students copying openly, relatives climbing walls to help them and chits being passed through windows.
Relatives are seen scrambling up boundary walls at an exam centre to get access to students in what appears to be mobile phone footage. A security guard is seen chasing some of them armed with a cane.
 
People are seen scrambling up boundary walls at an exam centre.
In Mathura, nine people including a superintendent of a school were suspended for allowing students to share their answers.The suspended teachers were later arrested after a senior district official stopped at an exam centre as part of a flying squad and caught blatant cheating in progress.
 
Mobile phone footage showed people trying to get access to the Centre.
"Similar answers were written by all the examinees appearing for the chemistry paper in Ratan Singh Inter College Daulatpur in Baldeo area. Nine invigilators and the centre superintendent were booked for mass cheating," said the official.
A year ago, photos of students cheating in Class 10 exams in Bihar drew international ridicule. Men were seen scaling the walls of an exam centre in the images that were highlighted in foreign newspapers. The men were apparently trying to pass cheat-sheets to students through windows, unchecked by supervisors.

                            No need to worry as UP is a pure secular state ruled by purest secular party SP and copying is the foundation of pure secularism and sedition against the nation is hall mark of pure secularism taught in teh secular universities like JNU in UP and praised by secular media editors, secular media owners, secular jornalists, secular politicians secular writers, tolerant bollywood actors. Pakistan, Saudi and USA will be proud of Indian secularism as it promotes sedition against India. Thanks to secularism.

                            All the people that are dragging the caste into this issue, how do you even know their caste by watching a 1 min video clip? Stop bringing religion and caste in to everything.

                            Take strong action against the invigilators. It is their responsibility. If they feel that despite their best efforts, there has been cheating in their centers, then the invigilators should report that and all exams at that center should be cancelled. You will soon know which are the problem centers. Then have a second round of exams for just those centers with heightened security.
