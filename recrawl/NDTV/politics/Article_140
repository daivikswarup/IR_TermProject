New Delhi: HighlightsMet department issues rain and thunderstorms warning on the day of event
The event has a huge open-air stage for artistes, enclosures for people
Rain could lead to waterlogging, traffic snarls on the road to the venue
                                The National Green Tribunal may have let Sri Sri Ravishankar's Art of Living to go ahead with the World Cultural Festival after a rap on the knuckles, but weather could play spoilsport at the largely open-air mega-fest.
 
The India Meteorological Department or IMD has issued a warning that "an intense western disturbance currently lying over Iran and neighbourhood would affect Indian sub-continent from March 11 onwards." That is also the day the festival begins.
 IMD says, "Rain or thundershowers could occur at most/many places over plains of northwest India." The venue of the event has a huge open-air stage, spread over an area occupied by six football fields, to accommodate the thousands of artistes who will take part in the fest. Besides, open enclosures have been put up to accommodate the more than 3.5 million people expected to attend it.
The IMD has warned, "Thunderstorm accompanied with strong winds and isolated hailstorm could occur over Delhi from March 11 to 13."
 
The rain could also lead to water logging and traffic snarls as most of the roads leading to the giant amphitheatre are mostly unpaved.
 
On Friday, PM Modi is to open the festival that will feature yoga and meditation sessions, peace prayers and cultural performances. A separate enclosure is being set up for him close to the gate but amid security concerns, it is not clear whether he will finally attend.

                            this is a conspiracy against sri sri sri sri (God knows how many sris). there is definitely a foreign hand to sabotage the hindu festival. Modi should warn Pakistan not to play such dangerous games with 56 inches. Arnab should expose the Congress hand in this and the jokers from the retired Army fatigues and RAW and Defence Analyst morons should beat their chests and shout loud to denounce the anti-India actions by Rahul against hindu community. I am going to file an FIR.

                            When judiciary and government fail, it's only nature that is left to deliver justice. Hope it pours cats and dogs, so bhaktas can truly enjoy!

                            It is not going to rain. Just wait and see. The program for world peace will be a huge success. All the so called intolerant brigade, secularists and fake environmentalists will start crying after that.
