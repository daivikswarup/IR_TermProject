New Delhi:Â                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today congratulated the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientists on the successful launch of the sixth navigation satellite IRNSS-1F into orbit.
"Successful launch of IRNSS-1F is an accomplishment we all take immense pride in. I salute the hard work of our scientists and ISRO," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India today successfully put into orbit its sixth navigation satellite IRNSS-1F by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C32) rocket.
With this success, India moved closer towards joining a select group of nations possessing their own satellite-based navigation system.
Named as the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), the system consists of a constellation of seven satellites, of which the sixth was put into orbit today.
