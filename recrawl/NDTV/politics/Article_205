Headline::::Ramdev's Food Park Gets Round-The-Clock Protection From Paramilitary CISF

Highlights35 armed commandos from CISF to protect Ramdev's food park in Haridwar
CISF director informed that the 'client' will bear the entire cost
The food park is the 8th entity to be guarded by the paramilitary force
                                Yoga guru Ramdev's food park in Haridwar will be protected around the clock by armed commandos from the paramilitary force of the Central Industrial Security Force or CISF.
CISF Director General Surender Singh said the "client"-- Patanjali Food and Herbal Park Private Limited-- will bear the entire cost of the deployment.
A squad of 35 CISF men had been assigned to the park in Uttarakhand at the facility last year after one person died following clashes between security guards at the food park and truckers who were upset with out-of-state operators being used.
It is highly unusual for the government to offer CISF cover to the private sector. The food park will be the eighth such unit which will be guarded by the paramilitary force after it was first mandated for such tasks after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 166 people were killed. The other seven companies guarded by the CISF include the Infosys campuses in Bengaluru, Mysore and Pune.
Officials said the annual expenditure for the CISF protection at the multi-acre food park is estimated to be about Rs. 40 lakhs and barracks and vehicles will also be provided by the "client".
Ramdev, a yoga expert whose business empire is worth thousands of crores of rupees and creates personal care and food products, is himself a 'Z' category protectee of central paramilitary forces, reserved for people assessed as especially vulnerable to terror threats.
Routine entry and exit at the food park will be regulated by the staff and private security hired by the client, said unnamed officials to news agency Press Trust of India.

                            Let's do a simple calculation. Baba Company will pay 40 lakhs per annum for a group of 35 personnel. It means Rs.9500 per month per personnel where as expenditure per personnel per months is over a lakh including their salary, PF contribution from Govt. HRA, pension, medical etc. In addition the expenditure towards weapons is too much. This is just a eye wash that, expenditure is done by Pvt. Company. One question is that if I am a capable individual and can bear the expenditure then CISF will also provide security for me also?

                            Business Guru, despite his yoga expertise, is a black dot on the fairness of India. If of course, we dare call India fair with all the black spots on its face in the form of corrupt, rapist and criminal murderers as its political and business leaders. In the long business list, Ambani, Adani and Ramdev stand out. Shame on you paying just over Rs. 9000/-month for risking the life to safeguard your money spinning machines. If people in saffron robes, considered to be free from materialistic connections can stoop so low to mint money, what to talk of the politicians who give protection to such anti nationals and provide them all facilities to beat their competitors.

                            Ridiculous use of professional resources. Is this what the state spends crores on training for? To act as 'bodyguards' for some baba? To say that Ramdev will pay for it is just an eyewash and not justification for deploying state resources. Let him get his own security. How many Tatas, Ambanis, Birlas etc have asked for state security in the past? Is the public simply expected to put up with such abuse? Modi has to stop this nonsense. The country is not going to stand for such blatant misuse of scarce resources. This is not some BJP vs Congress drama. Rather a case of Modi and his goons vs the Indian people.

                            If infosys is jewel of india, Prantanli is also producing something that is made in india.. No body is forcing consumer to buy this product &amp; still if they are making 4000Cr as revenues, why not give him the same perks as infosys!! Just because he is more lean towards BJP/Hindu culture, does not bar his co from getting perks other does.. Com-eon guys i am of independent mind &amp; i am not RSS but i am not communist who oppose any Hindu or Capitalist event..!! They are paying for services which included employment to 35 persons, tax etc.. Please open your mind &amp; think of entrepreneurship &amp; business as the only engine of prosperity!!

1. Is it First Time CISF given security to any Co.<br/>
2.Is 100s of Private cos are already not having same protection.<br/>
3.Is it free to Patanjali.<br/>
4.If Patanjali kind of co. may had started in US to fight with Foreign cos. Baba Ramdeve may had Received various awards subsidies from Government and appreciation from Media.<br/><br/>
