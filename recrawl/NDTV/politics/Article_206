New Delhi:                             515 National Security Guard (NSG) commandos protect the country's 16 VIPs who are all politicians, including Home Minister Rajnath Singh, L K Advani and Mulayam Singh Yadav.
Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parathibhai Choudhury said the National Security Guard is primarily a counter- terrorism force. "However, NSG has also been tasked with providing security to 16 protectees. The number of NSG security personnel deployed on VIP security is 515 as on February 1, 2016," he said replying to a written question in Lok Sabha.

                            We need the VIPs to take care of themselves. Besides, they are also worth one human life and theirs is not more valuable than our highly trained and respected Jawans. Who even respects these criminal politicans? To become an Indian actor/ politician, the only pre-requisite is to be born in those families without any qualifications but our jawans work very hard.
