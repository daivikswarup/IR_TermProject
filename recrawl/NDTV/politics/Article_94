New Delhi: HighlightsKey documents on Ishrat Jehan case are missing, says Home Minister
There should be no politics, no flip-flops on terror: Rajnath Singh
P Chidambaram is accused of rewriting affidavits with Ishrat's LeT links
                                The opposition Congress was under attack in Parliament today over the Ishrat Jehan case, with the ruling BJP accusing P Chidambaram of manipulating documents when he was home minister.
"Like Rajiv Gandhi was killed, would (PM Narendra) Modi have to die before the Congress took action?" questioned BJP lawmaker Nishikant Dubey, initiating a discussion in the Lok Sabha. He also referenced Sonia Gandhi's "Maut ke Saudagar (merchants of death)" barb for Narendra Modi and said: "Were they trying to do maut ka sauda (business over death)?"
Mr Chidambaram is accused of rewriting government documents to say that there was no proof that 19-year-old Ishrat Jehan, killed in 2004 by Gujarat police officers, was a terrorist.
The Gujarat police said Ishrat, and three others shot dead with her, were involved in a plot to kill then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh said key documents are missing from his ministry.
"Two letters from the then home secretary to the attorney general in 2009 have gone missing. The then attorney general had vetted two affidavits regarding the case. Those are also not available," Mr Singh said.
Without naming Mr Chidambaram, the home minister raised the alleged amendments.
"There should be no politics on terror. Be it the Ishrat Jehan or any other case, no government should do flip-flops," he said, adding: "Those who call themselves secular, they tried to give communal colour to terrorism, coined the term saffron terror. This happened for the first time in the world. We will not accept it in any way in the country."
Terrorist David Coleman Headley's statement to a Mumbai court that Ishrat was linked to the terror group Lashkar e Taiba revived the political row over the case.
Headley's statement was seized by the BJP to reiterate that the Congress portrayed Ishrat as an innocent student shot dead on the orders of the Gujarat government, mainly to tarnish Mr Modi.
 
"This was done to malign the Gujarat government and then Chief Minister (Narendra Modi). This was a conspiracy," Rajnath Singh said as Congress members shouted slogans relentlessly.

                            Walking out does not solve anything, it is the mark of cowards. If Congress has erred, they should own up.

                            Ishrat Jehan's case clearly exposes to what level Congress can stoop down to play politics. Their hatred for one man has pushed them to such an extent that they went about covering the case at the cost of national security. They were supported by the self claimed activists and some section of media. These people even after this much of revelations still deny any charges. Political differences should be ideological but here they were supporting a group which came into our country to finish off some of the political leaders including Modi in Gujarat. You still find some sickular media houses not giving the revelation the due coverage simply because of the animosity they have for the one man. It is not only the political party which was involved in the cover up be exposed but also these media houses which should be exposed. Truth should and  will come out one day. No doubt about it.

                            The congress would have applauded Ishrat Jehan and the LeT if Modi had been harmed in a terrorist action. What do you expect of the congress anyway?

                            If she was in Police custody / control (as mentioned in report that police was tailing her) and it was known that she had links with terrorists, why the hell was she to be killed in an encounter without questioning. She would have been far more valuable to get more information about the terrorists if not killed. If she was questioned, then there definitely would be records and data, just bring them out in public domain and end the discussion. Her being a terrorist cannot be a reason for fake encounter. I say fake because government agencies had all the chances to apprehend her alive.

                            Its shame on Home Minister statement about a girl who came with his friends to kill by empty hands to Modi when he was Gujrat CM. CM was in covered round the clock with VVIP security Is Gujrat CM was sitting on street corner ? Only on the basis of David Headley confession thru video conferencing. What is the proof Government is having about David Headley claimed on girl is authentic ? This is ridiculous saying two letters are missing from HM records, now a days when technology become advance even small firms are using servers to saved data, how can Home Ministry missed two letters ?
