Chennai: HighlightsIndian space agency ISRO to launch sixth navigation satellite IRNSS-1F
The satellite aims at providing navigation at par with US' GPS
The satellite will be launched today at 4pm from Sriharikota
                                Indian Space agency ISRO's sixth navigation satellite IRNSS-1F was launched on board trusted workhorse PSLV C32 today at 4:01 pm. The launch, originally slated for 4:00 pm, was delayed by a minute to avoid space debris.
The 54-and-half hour countdown began on Tuesday soon after the Mission Readiness Review Committee and Launch Authorisation Board cleared it "progressed normally", Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) officials said.
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C32 on its 34th mission has launched the IRNSS-1F, aimed at providing navigation accurately on par with the US-based Global Positioning System, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at the spaceport of Sriharikota about 110 km from Chennai. Indian Space Research Organisation to provide independent regional navigation satellite system on par with GPS, had launched five navigation satellites under the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).
While four satellites would be sufficient to start operations of the IRNSS system, the remaining three would make it more "accurate and efficient", an ISRO official said.
"With the launch of four satellites, we were able to provide navigation for 18 hours. But after fifth launch we increased the capacity to 24 hours with an accuracy of 20 metres. The sixth IRNSS-1F and seventh launch (IRNSS-1G) will be accurate and more efficient," said an ISRO official.
The five satellites already launched are IRNSS-1A on July 1, 2013, IRNSS-1B on April 4, 2014, IRNSS-1C on October 16, 2014, IRNSS-1D on March 28, 2015 and IRNSS-1E on January 20, 2016.
ISRO scientists plan to put all seven navigation satellites into orbit by March 2016. The last in the series is expected to be launched by month end.
For the IRNSS-1F launch, scientists have used the "XL" variant used in previous launches of IRNSS satellites, given its capacity to carry load.
Similar occasions where rocket with XL configuration were used were during launch of Chandrayaan-1, Mars Orbiter Mission, ASTROSAT besides the five IRNSS satellites.
     
Along with the navigation payload and ranging payload, the satellite also carries a "highly accurate Rubidium atomic clock" with it. The payload will transmit navigation service signals to the users.
     
The 44.4 metre tall IRNSS-1F has a liftoff mass of 1,425 kg and was launched in sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub GTO). It has a 12 year mission life.

                            It is an extremely proud moment that ISRO is progressing in its count down for the 32 launch of PSLV. It is also good to know that ISRO will shortly be completing the IRNNS navigational satellite.  While it is a proud achievement for ISRO,  I am not sure if govt would make mandatory for all mobile phone manufacturers to support IRNNS satellite signals  for GPS purpose. only then this huge investment and capability will be of any value.
