Bareilly: Highlights28-year-old woman gangraped in an empty private bus in Bareilly
Woman's 2-week old baby fell off her lap as she tried to fight assaulters
Woman allegedly raped by driver and conductor, cops looking for culprits
                                In one horrifying bus ride on Monday night, a woman in Uttar Pradesh was gang-raped and she lost her infant son while trying to fight off her attackers.
The 28-year-old woman boarded a mostly empty private bus last night with her two children, including a 14-day-old boy. She was heading back to Rampur, around 70 km away, after visiting her sister.
The woman reportedly slept off, urged by the driver and the conductor, and did not realise when all other passengers got off at a point.
The driver and the conductor allegedly assaulted her and when she was trying to fight them off, the baby fell from her lap.
They allegedly dumped her on the road and drove off. The police are looking for the alleged rapists.
The incident, which emerged as Women's Day was being celebrated in India and across the world on Tuesday, has chilling echoes of the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student by five men on a private bus.

                            Option 1 : Find these rapist, execute them, remove their vital organs and donate to hospital and rest of the body which cannot be used, give to their families to perform last rites.<br/><br/>
Option 2: Debate by intellectuals where we feel pity for the women and feel sorry for the child. And after Blah Blah Blah prepare for next debate. After all we are from the land of Rai ( Advice) Bahadur &amp; Rai saheb.

                            Brutal. Humanity is murdered every now &amp; then. When will men in this country change their view towards women? The difference between boys and girls is inculcated from the childhood, and at every level. This kind of mindset makes our society very much heterogeneous, causing sex related crimes.

                            And why should not we politicize it? And of course, why not blame the PMO while the state govt belongs to somebody else who must have set a record by now of rapes &amp; genocides(riots). <br/><br/>
As for us, Being humane--what the hell is that? Do we even realise how tragic this incident is? Are we really left with that intellect or should we take this as an issue of debates between Pro-Namo &amp; Anti-Namo?<br/><br/>
I doubt of they can ever get hold of the culprits considering the Law &amp; Order of the state, and even if we do, we shall have the Social Activists/ Human Rights to urge for their freedom !!<br/><br/>
As of now, we shall put fire on the screens for a day or two regarding this topic till the time the media will carefully shift our attention to WorldT20 or the thrilling chess game between India &amp; Pak Govt on the same.

                            This has to stop, and only way to do it is to execute the criminals by capital punishment. I am not sure why the majority gov of BJP is not doing it. MR Modi should now listen to some of his own speeches.. Hight time Mr PM, we voted for you, not for your deafening silence...

                            Keep releasing the accused without punishing them and this is what will happen even more. No one has the fear that they will get punished then how will the attitude change.

                            Not surprised at all..It is an everyday affair in UP nowadays. Couple of weeks ago, a girl was raped and murdered half a kilometer away from the CM's house in Lucknow. Two days later, a girl was found raped and murdered couple of Kilometers further away. Two days ago, a man was killed in broad daylight, just because he kept his hand on the windshield of a parked car. Same day, two people were shot dead by unidentified shooters using a banned firearm...What else to expect when half the cabinet of UP is filled with criminals...Except case 1, no arrests have been made so far...

                            Everyday a woman or a girl is raped. They are burnt, murdered. If this continues, people will loose faith in law and it will be on the spot judgement. Courts wake up.
