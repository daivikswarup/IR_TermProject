New Delhi:                             After positive signs from the Congress, the largest party in the Rajya Sabha, the government has put the real estate bill on the fast track.
The urgency is reflected by the government's move to get the bill listed on the Rajya Sabha as early as on Tuesday. Top sources in the government said, "There are bills already awaiting consideration and passing in the Rajya Sabha...But, if the opposition led by the Congress agrees, the government is ready to push the real estate bill before other bills."On Monday, Urban Development Minister M Venkiah Naidu struck a confident note when he said, "During this budget session of Parliament, the Real Estate Bill will become a reality."
In May last year, the government's bid to pass the bill was thwarted by a united opposition. Facing unbeatable opposition numbers, the government reluctantly moved a motion to send the bill to a select committee - an ad hoc house panel set up with a single agenda. The panel submitted its report on July 30, last year.
Last week, the Congress wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Naidu, asking them to pursue the bill in the first leg of the Budget session of Parliament. But, the party sent out an even stronger signal last week when its vice president, Rahul Gandhi, assured a group of homebuyers that the Congress will support the bill.
The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha in 2013. In December, the Union cabinet approved 20 major amendments to the bill that seeks to protect home buyers as well as help boost investments in the real estate industry.
Under the proposed law, projects on at least 500 sq metres of area or with eight flats will have to be registered with the proposed regulatory authority.
Builders will have to deposit at least 70 per cent of the sales proceeds, including land cost, in an escrow account to meet construction cost, compared with the earlier proposal for 50 per cent or less. Also, builders will have to pay interest to home buyers for delays and be liable for structural defects for five years, instead of two years earlier.

                            Why does NDTV always have to highlight the fact that Congress is the majority party in Rajya Sabha? Until the 2014 rout, Rajya Sabha news were not even mentioned in any of the news channels! Quite ironic..

                            useless to bring any law. builders already found a way around..they are not making proper sales agreement which describes project completion date. problem solved for them. Need is to make it mandatory for builders to submit sales agreement to govt authorities and buyers should be allowed to get as many copies as they need

                            First and foremost , all builders developers and promoters must be forced to have dedicated project accounts, by project and not by companies or groups. This is prevent recycling funds into more projects without directing funds to specific project at hand. <br/><br/>
Second the builders, developers and promoted must be compelled to have own the land as Registered land owner and must state to buyers undivided share of such land. Such share of land must be vested with the buyer immediately on initial payments.  Builders should not be allowed to launch a project with a mere power of attorney and must grant the Purchasers Clean and nil encumbrance certificates.  <br/><br/>
Thirdly Banks must lend money on dedicated project accounts and not on syndicated cumulative credit facilities. This is to prevent cumbersome and complicated processes in  purchasers seeking redress in Courts. Otherwise monies paid the Purchasers are applied to various  other projects of which the  Purchasers have no control. <br/><br/>
Fourthly  a time limit of 36 months shall be set for all projects after which a severe punitive penalty shall apply besides the compensation to the Purcahsers for delay. All reasons for delay must be negated <br/><br/>
Finally, how come every major , builders and promoters, developers across the nation, big and small show massive losses and yet have several other on going projects and launch many more without completing any of the ongoing projects. There is something very wrong at vigilance at IT Dept across the nation.
