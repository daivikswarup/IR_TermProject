                                                        India's numerous gurus are frequently surrounded by controversies. They have been accused of sexual misconduct, even murder, amassing illegal wealth and land in courts.
Now, the globally renowned Indian guru, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of the Art Of Living, is being accused of killing New Delhi's river.
Shankar is constructing a massive tent city for a weekend event with a stage that is the size of six football grounds, on the flood plain of the capital's beleaguered Yamuna River.River activists say the damage to the river's fragile floodplain will take many years to undo. A team of the National Green Tribunal that visited the site said that it would take nearly $ 1.8 million to restore the floodplains.
On Tuesday, the green court admonished the city's authorities for giving permission to the guru and for not monitoring the violation of its earlier order against all temporary and permanent structures near the banks.
The bearded guru wearing flowing white robes rose to fame teaching his disciples breathing techniques to relieve urban stress and advising them to pursue happiness. His foundation has nearly 10,000 centers around the world.
To celebrate 35 years of his work, he is hosting a three-day event along the river that is expected to attract over 3.5 million visitors, and about 37,000 artists who will sing, dance, meditate and perform yoga. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the event.
But Manoj Mishra, a long-time river activist, said that Shankar's foundation has denuded the banks of all vegetation, destroyed farmers' cauliflower crop, built mud paths, dumped debris.
"They have caused a public injury, not a private hurt. They have devastated almost the entire floodplain of the river," said Mishra, who leads a public campaign to save the river. "On one hand, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is known as the apostle of peace and non-violence. But there can be nothing more violent than what he is doing to the Yamuna River."
The government also sent military men to build pontoons for the event, enraging some residents.
On Monday, India's president, Pranab Mukherjee canceled his participation in the event because of the controversy.
The Yamuna River, on most days, looks more like a drain, foul-smelling and filled with trash. Residents largely ignore the river and rarely visit its banks, except on religious festivals when they fling thousands of plastic bags filled with offerings. Untreated sewage and industrial waste flow into the river and rampant construction along the banks have choked its flow over the years.
Its floodplains have been encroached upon by the Metro rail project, a massive temple and apartments.
The new age guru said he has government permission for the event and that his foundation is using eco-friendly materials and erecting only temporary structures. He added that his volunteers are also pouring enzymes into the river to clean it.
"Some people just want to gain fame by making these allegations. In the heart of heart, everyone knows it is a dead river. It is so polluted, so toxic. There is nothing left to pollute," said Shankar. "To say we are damaging the river is the biggest joke of the century."

                            This event by Sri Sri will bring huge economic benefits. Foreign fund will flow in through tourism and local businesses would benefit from the huge attendance. The river Yamuna is already a dead river full of human faeces and waste thrown for many years . Now these environmentalist have to do the beg and call of their foreign paymasters who keep them afloat through their sinister agenda.
