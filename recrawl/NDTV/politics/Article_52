New Delhi: HighlightsGreen court hearing petition to stop event as fine yet to be paid
PM Modi expected to kick off event on the banks of Yamuna at 3pm today
'Will go to jail but won't pay the 5 crore fine', said Sri Sri
                                Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's organization has told India's top environmental court that it cannot pay a 5-crore fine before the event begins today on the banks of the River Yamuna in Delhi. The Art of Living foundation said that it is a charitable organization and needs a month to collect the money; it also wants to use the five-crore penalty towards the creation of a biodiversity park, as ordered by the court earlier this week. On Wednesday, the National Green Tribunal cleared the three-day festival on the floodplains of the River Yamuna, berating both the organizers and government departments for failing to take enough steps to protect the venue's delicate ecosystem.  The court said its sanction for the event rests on conditions like a 5-crore penalty to be paid in advance, and a commitment from the organizers to create a biodiversity park after the festival ends.Yesterday, Sri Sri, 59, spiritual guru to millions, told NDTV, "We will go to jail but not pay a penny.  We have done nothing wrong."  The green court said hours later that his Art of Living Foundation had till today to comply with the penalty.
The festival, expected to draw lakhs of attendees, has created traffic jams on the main highway that connects the capital to the huge suburb of Noida.  
The event over the next three days will include musical performance son a seven-acre stage, mass meditation sessions and prayers led by Sanskrit scholars, the organization has said, with Sri Sri describing it as "a Cultural Olympics".
Activists who had asked for the event to be banned say construction at the venue has been allowed without any risk assessment to the environment, a claim that the organizers denounce as invalid.

                            I have lost all the respect I had for Sri Ravishankar and the Art of Living foundation after this. The court has made a judgement and if he wanted he could have appealed it or paid the fine and be done with it. But instead he is disrespecting the court and disobeying the judgement. This is the biggest problem in India, the absence of the rule of law. Hopefully the court will stand its ground and cancel the event.

                            I just saw - on searching google - a report submitted in 2013 by a 3 member committee to NGT - about absolute need to maintain 53 km. stretch of Yamuna in Delhi &amp; part of Uttar Pradesh and it was clearly recommended in Report that any recreational projects (this MEGA event - cultural program - is of course, recreational activity) proposed by DDA or any body, should not be considered at all on Yamuna River Bank. Art of Living is getting FREE PUBLICITY indirectly but they need to be punished - severely - the highest punishment as per law.

                            Mumbai, dated 7/12/2017: Mukesh Ambani's daughter Isha's wedding ceremony was celebrated in a grand scale today. The President and the Prime Minister of India, world business leaders, Reliance share holders and other invitees graced the event. It was estimated that a total of about 9 lakh people attended.<br/><br/>
As earlier reported, the ceremony was held on a specially built off-shore structure on the high seas, 7 kilometers form the coast. Apart from ONGC, the Indian army, navy and air-force were commissioned to handle the immense logistical and security challenges.<br/><br/>
Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that with such large number of attendees and the valuable international exposure for the economy, the government will bear all costs related to ONGC and military. He also stated that all patriotic and nationalistic Indians welcome this wholeheartedly, especially since the families of the bride and groom are all Hindus.
