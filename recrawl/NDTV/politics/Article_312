New Delhi:Â                             A former Mumbai Police commissioner and BJP lawmaker Satyapal Singh today said that as the SIT chairman he was allured by the then Congress-led UPA government to frame Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the alleged fake encounter case of Ishrat Jehan.
PM Narendra Modi was then the chief minister of Gujarat.
"I got a call from one of the top Congress leaders, who said that home minister has selected you especially for a mission and that mission is to prove the entire case a lie and you have to reach up to Gujarat chief minister," Mr Singh, a parliamentarian from Baghpat (Uttar Pradesh) said.
Mr Singh was speaking while participating in a discussion on the calling attention motion on alleged alteration of affidavit relating to Ishrat Jehan case.
"I was allured. I told this to then chief minister of Maharashtra and his secretary," he said.
"I told them that I can't do this work. My soul does not allow me to do so," he said while clarifying why he left to continue as the chairman of the SIT.
"Neither Congress nor BJP can pressurise me. I thought, whatever report I will submit, I will be targeted. So I made excuses of not knowing Gujarati and left," he said, adding that "I even told the home minister that I can't work under such circumstances."
Mr Singh also accused the then UPA government of pressurising the officers of CFSL for changing the report.
He also demanded a commission of enquiry to probe the matter thoroughly.

                            We should be proud that the Indian army recently sentenced its own soldiers to life imprisonment for fake encounter killings in Kashmir. If poor soldiers can be punished, why is this government manipulating to save a fat-cat politician like Amit Shah from exactly the same crime?<br/><br/>
Shame on our political class. Sacrificing soldiers while unabashedly saving their own skin!

                            Just at the time of last LS election, some bureaucrates &amp; CAG &amp; some old cong insects came out with their books on daily basis, One after another. What does it tell?? It was well-planned BJP strategy by inciting those people(when they can bribe TV &amp; other media, this wasn't that difficult!!)and defaming MMS and cong. <br/>
Exactly, similar plan is under way right now to save kaali dadhi, safed dadhi and fake encounter specialists of police force. It is for this reason, one after another started crying foul about the encounter and affidavit etc. Suddenly, David hedly has become their saint now.
