Patna: HighlightsBJP leader Shatrughan Sinha backs JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar
Sinha praised 'son of Bihar' Kanhaiya's speech as 'thought provoking'
Sinha's move being seen as yet another embarrassment for BJP
                                Bharatiya Janata Party leader Shatrughan Sinha today supported Jawaharlal Nehru Students Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, praising his speech that he delivered after being released from jail on six-month bail.
Mr Sinha dubbed Mr Kumar, who is facing sedition charges for participating in a JNU event held to commemorate the death anniversary of terrorist Afzal Guru, as "son of Bihar", who delivered a good and thought-provoking speech in the JNU campus after being released from Tihar jail.
He said Mr Kumar belongs to a poor family in a village in Bihar but proved that he has potential.
Earlier, Mr Sinha had expressed happiness when Mr Kumar was granted bail by the Delhi High Court. "Hope, wish and pray that he will prove himself worthy of the support that he received from everyone who felt he was wronged."
Unlike most of the BJP leaders, Mr Sinha said there was nothing wrong if Mr Kumar demanded azadi (freedom) from poverty, casteism, hunger besides his stand on freedom of expression under the rights provided by the Constitution.
Mr Sinha said he heard that several top leaders of the country, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, have lauded Mr Kumar and his speech.
In the last few months, Mr Sinha has openly expressed views that differ from the party line on issues such as "return of jungle raj" in Bihar to praising Mr Nitish Kumar around the state Assembly elections in which the BJP suffered an embarrassing defeat.
Mr Sinha's latest move is being viewed as yet another action causing embarrassment to the BJP.

                            Glad that there are still some people within the BJP who don't have their blinkers on all the time. <br/>
It's all too obvious that Kanhaiya Kumar has said nothing anti-national or even anything that is not completely true.

                            There is nothing wrong in demanding azaadi from corruption and poverty. Unfortunately, thanks to some clever political manipulation and a pliant media two incidents got overlapped. In the beginning, it was only about a certain posters and certain slogans. As the case progressed, Kanhaiya was arrested for which Delhi Police must give an explanation to the court. A group of lawyers took law into their hands for which they must be punished. But it still does not absolve the original parties to the original act of indiscretion.

                            Shatrughan Sinha is challenging the BJP at every step of the way but the hapless party can't act against him. In this case, the party finds itself in a bind. Its leaders dug their own graves by first branding him anti-national and then by remaining silent on his manhandling in the courts. This boy, without doubt, is a very clear thinker who not only articulated his speech well but also acquitted himself very sensibly and maturely in subsequent interviews with BD and RK. God Bless this young man in his struggle against the unreasonableness of the system.This nation needs many more KKs to put up a stronger front against the fascists.

                            Had Shatru was given a seat of power he would have talked differently. Had he been projected as cm candidate of Bihar Shatru would have mercilessly attacked Nitish. I find him silly.

                            Khamosh... Bewakoof aadmi.. Unfortunately, the BJP is very tolerant towards this moronic man who still thinks that he is on the 70mm screen. I wish he would stop his histrionics and let the government and party function without having to keep wasting time doing damage control for the stupid comment he passes. He is one bitter soul from the time he was overlooked for any cabinet position and is unable to keep himself khamosh.

                            Mr Shathru wants expulsion from the Party so that he can make Noise and get Sympathy for Reelection by joining another Party. But BJP is not taking any action.If he resigns on his own then a Full Stop to his Political Carrier.

The more you say something totally contrary to your Party, your statements will be making headlines and will be covered by these so called sickular, (un)biased media which will play it over and over again. Their target is Modi and only Modi.

                            Bongi, Comis and Presstis, plz bear in mind that this person is a student body leader. He is bound to face action if the student body he presides on in involved in anti-national activity. His speech was fantastic but the undertones were more about how the current day government has not given 15lacs, arhar daal has become costly and Sanghis are dividing nation. These are the lines which any pro-Comi, Congi or AAPtard will say and get full publicity by the Presstis. So he is not a new kid on the block he is a trained and doctored kid who is put forth because if the allegations made by him do not affect the current Opposition if they backfire. If the opposition has guts then why does it not take out an anti-government protest for giving everyone 15lacs, bringing daal prices down. Stop scratching each others back and focus on the PC and Ishrat cases Sickulars and Media Pundits

                            These politicians are ready to sell out their motherland just for the political benefits. We have witness the posters n propoganda on Afzal Guru's death Anniversary. If Afzal Guru was not Kanhaiyas icon then why he organised his death Anniversary. On 9th feb there was the banner of Afzal Guru who is declared terrorist by judiciaries.

                            Good to hear leaders like Shatrughan Sinha air their views boldly. Let's not see it as challenging the BJP leadership.  Yes, Kanhaiya's speech was indeed laudable.  Wish more BJP leaders, who i am sure in the heart of heart agrees with what Kanhaiya has said, come out in the open.  After all, don't we live in a democracy.

It is in our turn to decide to stand for the nation or to wait till its "barbaadi".  Now it is our turn to say "Bharath Mata Ki Jai" before they all come together and sell our great nation to Pakistan for their cheap political benefits.
