New Delhi:Â HighlightsVenkaiah Naidu slams Congress objections to Sri Sri event
Anything that is Hindu, Bharatiya, you object (to), he said
Festival opens in Delhi on Yamuna banks amid environmental concerns
                                Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has offered a strong defense of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's mega-festival that opens tomorrow in Delhi amid environmental concerns. "Anything that is Hindu, India, Bharatiya, you object," Mr Naidu said in response to the opposition Congress which says the government has abdicated its environmental responsibility by sanctioning the banks of the River Yamuna as the venue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has confirmed he will attend the opening of the "World Culture Festival" tomorrow, though President Pranab Mukherjee dropped out earlier this week. "The prestige of the entire country is at stake," Mr Naidu said, stressing that "Nearly 35 world leaders are expected."
India's environmental watchdog, the National Green Tribunal, has ordered Sri Sri's Art of Living Foundation to deposit a fine of five-crores ahead of the event. The 59-year-old guru told NDTV today that, "We will go to jail but will not pay a penny...we have done nothing wrong." The green court has said the organisers have till tomorrow to pay the money, warning that otherwise, "the law will take its own course."
In Parliament yesterday, the Congress led the opposition's attack on the government over the event that encompasses 1,000 acres on the Yamuna's floodplains; activists allege the precinct's delicate ecosystem will be irreversibly hurt by the temporary construction and the lakhs of attendees. The government was also asked why the army has been used to construct floating or pontoon bridges over the rivers.
Mr Naidu was unequivocal in declaring that the event, which will include meditation sessions, music performances and prayers by Sanskrit scholars, deserves government support. "Ravi Shankar is from India so you have objections," the minister said, targeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. "You went to an Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon concert and now you are objecting to a world cultural event," he said, referring to Mr Gandhi's recent visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University amid a major controversy over whether students there made seditious remarks while questioning the hanging of two convicts of terror attacks.
Critics claim that Sri Sri's alleged proximity to the Prime Minister, with whom he has meditated, has meant his festival was given all sorts of exemptions from green clearances that should have been mandatory for an event of this scale, given its location.

                            Anything related to Hinduism has become a bad word in present scenario. Pseudo-Secularism has done great damage to the cultural heritage of India.

                            Great, this is all we need now. BJP has made this an ego issue. <br/><br/>
So any (Hindu) godman can do anything under this govt it appears. All laws and rules be damned. If courts orders him to pay Rs 5 crores - he will just refuse. Nothing will happen. If bridge is required, army will build it. <br/><br/>
And finally, if anyone objects to these various violations of law - he is deemed anti-national. Any objectors are put into the Afzal Guru camp. Very easy. <br/><br/>
And of course, the final weapon - country's reputation is at stake. The moment i hear this, i know they are trying to cover up some wrongdoing. This is exactly what Congress said when they delayed and delayed the Commonwealth Games preparations. Finally everything had to be built at whatever cost - no matter because the country's image is at stake!!!<br/><br/>
How Modi's govt has fallen....

                            Absolutely right Mr. Naidu. There are only two groups which do not like Hindus &amp; hindu culture. The missionaries &amp; the commies. I don't include muslims because they don't have mostly the cultural hatred toward hindus as we have been together for to long. The whole issue has been once created by the commie-missionary combination. Which is also at work in maoist-naxal infested tribal areas. This issue once again has shown the true face of 'those three' electronic media houses those act as commie-missiy representatives.

                            Everybody knows that Sri Sri has only done good for the environment till today, so chances are what He's saying is true rather than believing these armchair specialists and AC studio talkers, NGT etc. He's said that not a single tree has been cut and only 4 trees are pruned. Do people who have made all these claims of environmental disaster have any proof that they've damaged the environment ? I've worked closely with Art of Living in the past and I'm quite sure Art of Living people won't damage the environment for any event. I smell something fishy here with people who are opposing this.

                            Sangh Parivar has moved to the next level. Earlier it was Babri issue and target was Muslims. Now it is Hindus who do not associate themselves with Sangh or its policies have become the target and also anyone who goes against the policies and decisions of the Sangh tribe. Scope of activity has been further widened to bring the 'anti-national' element into play along side the anti-Hindu philosophy. This is well-orchestrated campaign and one can clearly see the fact rank and file is involved.

                            Leaving aside the political rhetoric, does Mr. Naidu believe it is national pride to damage the environment in the name of culture? Why are such dignitaries including the PM attending it in spite of the Green Tribunal agreeing that there has been environmental damage? They could have declined if they really care about the environment and sent out a message for future event organizers, not matter of which faith. The BJP had pledged to clean the Yamuna (Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel said it) if elected in Delhi. So do politicians only care about causes if they get power, and not support them otherwise? Isn't preserving the environment as soon as possible not a necessary and worthy goal for any party, or do they need religion to preach that also?

Pls for heaven sake, try to keep our people together by speaking sensibly, an average citizen including me making such statements might still be accepted to an extent but you guys sitting in the highest posts of our nation's govt. are only giving the world a reason to mock us...n btw sir u r missing the catch stated by the petitioner that unlike kumbh mela or any other events which have been happening for years at designated &amp; allowed places, they cannot be compared to this been staged at a place which is banned from use for 25 years &amp; just as u used the army as a shield to defend ur actions in the recent days u have nw found a new shield " pride &amp; status of our nation" wow! u guys just don't give up only... :-)

                            Completely agree with Mr Naidu. If the ecosystem gets spoilt due to this "World Culture Festival",,, its not Sri Sri's fault,,,,, its environments fault. The Environment is Anti-Hindu, Anti-National and Pseudo-Secular. Ask the environment to leave India.

Spending public money by providing free govt service for private event of Sri Sri and flaunt all norms (whether environment, safety, security etc). Now they are trying to call all the people, who had raised voice against this illegal activity as anti-hindu &amp; anti-Bharatiya. Where are we going??? For everything RSS/BJP has only one defense Hindu, Bharatiya or Bharatmata.

                            First of all on one hand hes says this is supposed to be a World Culture Festival. So how is it Hindu festival? Secondly this wasnt the country's decision and plan to hold such an event. It was Sri Sri's, for the publicity and popularity of his own organisation. AOL has taken India, Indians and Rules and Law of the land for granted.

                            Sonia and Rahul are the biggest threat to national security. Hindus have been manipulated and insulted for far too long just because their culture was one of peace and compassion. Time has come that the Rajasic mindset of true Hindus should manifest and destroy all those who want to take our beloved Hindu India away. These people twist and turn facts and when Hindus get aggressive they call us intolerant. Yet they go on insulting the Hindu by objecting to an event of such greatness.

                            This is very unfortunate that a senior minister of the government is putting this issue Hindu vs rest. The issue is not that. The event is a private event. Sri Sri may be a great man, but he does not represent the entire HIndu community, sorry, this event is totally personal for Sri Sri and his trust. His followers will be there and I have no problem with the event as long as it does not impact the environment. Is Minster trying to say that "NGT" is anti-Hindu? It is NGT who is raising issue and no one else. This event can not be compared with 26th Jan, Kumbh and Amarnath yatra, those are events where most of the populations participate/or can participate, here this event is not in the same line. So, please do not make these type of non-sense comments (especially coming from a senior minister). Tomorrow, will give army and and other support to an event that I am going to organize for my followers?
