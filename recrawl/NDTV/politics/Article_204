Jaipur:                             Yoga guru Ramdev has accused some "unsocial elements" of trying to disturb the development plans of the Narendra Modi government by raising anti-national slogans.
"There are a few unsocial elements in the country who are trying to disturb the Modi government's developmental plans by raising anti-national slogans at JNU recently," said Ramdev, who had come to attend Bhartiya Kisan Sangh's Agri Expo-2016 at Muhana Mandi.
These elements are trying to divert the Modi government's sanklap (mission) of development, he said.
