New Delhi:                             After metros, security has been intensified in many other cities including Lucknow, Jaipur, Bhopal and Chandigarh over intelligence inputs that 10 terrorists from Pakistan may have entered India.
A high alert was sounded in Delhi and other metro cites yesterday after security agencies alerted that suspected Lashkar terrorists may have entered India via Gujarat and were planning a "big strike."
Sources in Islamabad said Pakistan's National Security Adviser Nasir Khan Janjua shared the information with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval on Saturday night that the 10 terrorists were planning a strike in Gujarat during the Shivratri festival on Monday.
While New Delhi did not confirm or deny this, security was strengthened across Gujarat and four teams of the National Security Guard commandos were sent to the state.
 
Security was increased across Gujarat on Saturday
Security has been increased at prominent temples, markets, railway stations, bus stands, malls, airports and other crowded places across cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Vijayawada, Bhopal and Chandigarh.
On Saturday, a Pakistani boat was seized by Border Security Force or BSF personnel in the Koteshwar creek area off the Kutch coast along the Indo-Pakistan border. But BSF officials had said its occupants fled upon seeing the security personnel and nothing suspicious was found.
Later in the day, a top army commander had said there were "disturbing inputs" about a possible terror attack in the country aimed at creating "maximum impact" during the Shivratri festival and the ongoing Parliament session.
