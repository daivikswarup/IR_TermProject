New Delhi:Â HighlightsComplaint against JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar after remarks on army
Kanhaiya Kumar: Women in Kashmir are raped by security personnel
Booked for sedition, a new complaint now filed by BJP youth wing
                                JNU students' union president Kanhaiya Kumar, who is out on bail in a sedition case, is facing ire of the BJP's youth wing for his remarks on the security forces in Kashmir.
Speaking on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA, Kanhaiya said, "No matter how much you try to stop us, we will speak up against human rights violations. We will raise our voice against AFSPA. While we have a lot of respect for our soldiers, we will still talk about the fact that in Kashmir women are raped by security personnel."Kanhaiya was addressing students at a late night march on the eve of International Women's Day on Wednesday. While he spoke of atrocities against women with examples of the war in Rwanda, he added, "You take example of Gujarat, women were not just killed but were raped first."The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha has filed a complaint in Vasant Vihar police station against Kanhaiya and JNU professor Nivedita Menon, saying they made "anti-national" statements.
"Despite the submission of an undertaking before court, Kanhaiya has yet again addressed a gathering of students and uttered poisonous words against the Indian Army, labelling them as rapists of Kashmiri Women," a BJYM statement said.
A senior police officer said the matter was being looked into, but added that "no FIR has been registered yet".
"JNU professor Nivedita Menon has been spewing hatred against the Indian Armed Forces in public meetings as well," the statement said, adding, "She made statements like it is recognized worldwide that India is illegally occupying Kashmir."
Ms Menon, who teaches at the Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory at the School of International Studies at JNU however said, "I don't believe anything I said was anti-national".
In Kanhaiya's defence, the All India Students Federation (AISF) said that his remarks were "in context of atrocities on women worldwide and not just in Kashmir," and that, "he in no way meant to demean the Army or any other force and he clarified that in his speech too."
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad or ABVP affiliated to the BJP, which was the first to raise an alarm over the February 9 event in JNU, issued a statement saying, "The judge in her order also advised Kanhaiya to not forget the contribution of those sacrificing lives on borders. His statement is an attack on Indian Army".
Kanhaiya was arrested on February 12 in a sedition case over an event on campus against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru during which anti-national slogans were allegedly raised. He was granted an interim bail for six months by Delhi High Court last week.

                            Menon, Kyear et al are going down the well trodden path that elevates total losers hate-filled lowlifes to instant intellectuals, national and international media darlings and celebrities. All that is required is make vicious comments against Hindus, Hinduism, BJP, Indian History and India. Bingo you have it!

                            Students go to university to study and improve their knowledge. They then need to do what is needed for humanity. Now we see bunch of students just talking unwanted things for the sake of publicity. This is a disgrace for our country. India is the most tolerant nation when compared to many countries. They should go and visit other countries to know what intolerance means really.

                            KK is going too far now. Someone should tell him not to meddle in Kashmir affairs. He should be informed that if our politicians had provided a political solution our Army CRPF and BSF soldiers would not be there. The fact that a few rape cases took place in the last 25 years does it mean the soldiers rape regularly. The Army has punished the few cases of rape that had taken place and there haven't been any cases for the last few years. There are more rape cases in Delhi in a year than in 25 years in Kashmir but that does not make all Delhities rapists!

                            The BJP's youth wing and the AVBP are a bunch of hot headed ppl. They are giving unnecessary publicity to Kanhaiya and his gang. They are just making a big issue out of this and providing a perfect platform for Kanhaiya to launch himself into politics. I can clearly see that there is another Kejriwal in making.<br/>
Kanhaiya on the other hand is carefully orchestrating his moves to make most out of the situation. <br/>
I am sure Kanhaiya and his gang must have raised such slogans before this event too. But all thanks to AVBP, ZEE tv &amp; Arnab Goswami , these ppl are featuring in all Indian media channels and newspapers.<br/>
Such useless comments should be ignored and that is the right step forward. Let it die a natural death.<br/>
The fabric of India is too strong to be affected by these petty sloganeers.<br/><br/>
We are are great Nation and ppl abroad think very highly of Indians. Even Pakistani's introduce themselves as Indians as they are ashamed of their Pakisthani identity.

Praise the lord ,there  might be a few instances of atrocities by the army  but look at the bigger picture on what they are doing for all of us<br/><br/>
I don't  know if one should support  ideology of this man ,on  every occasion this man has tried to demoralize the forces be it  the forces fighting in the naxal area or the in J.K.<br/><br/>
Freedom of speech....  there should be limit  to everything once in a while  its okay  but every time  you are speaking  you are trying to spew venom against the very forces sacrificing there life to allow us to execute our so called freedom of speech.

                            Kanhaiya makes it sound as though rapes are rampant in Kashmir. He must furnish details of cases that have not been reported or registered or action not been initiated basis which led him to make this statement. Any such incident is deplorable and calls for legal action against involved soldiers. But making sweeping statements as he has just done is also deplorable. If ever Kanhaiya is at the receiving end of terrorists in Kashmir, this very chap will cower and beg the very same Army he is castigating to save his life.

                            Dear ABVP and BJP remember the Buddha Jayanthi park rape case in which the prestigious Presidential bodyguards were involved. If the army could do it right under the nose of the president imagine what would have happened in Kashmir or Manipur. There was a conviction in this sordid affair and the concerned army personnel are bidding their time in jail for the heinous offense. Kanhaiya you are right we have to investigate your allegations. There was also an incident where some women in Manipur walked stark naked and called upon the Indian army to rape them in the Thagjam Manorama case. We cannot allow the army to go scot free. I also suggest that the right to bear arms should be made mandatory for all citizens. In this way people cannot commit atrocities on one another.

                            Mr.kanhiyas statement like this makes me feel that he is no more a student leader.he has become a political spokesperson and has to give absurd comments to stay in lime light.Let me tell we have 100s of student unions besides JNUSU.so just because you have support of JNU students doesn't means that you can comment anything against any one.I hope people select a more mature and sensible student then this fellow.You speak about complex things like Kashmir,our Constitution.let me ask you have you done anything for the people who suffered in the jat riots which is not much far from your college.i think you and your union should involve yourself in some constructive work rather then giving comments on Indian Army.

                            It clearly shows that JNU is producing such a bunch of anti-nationalists. His speeches well endorse the Rajnath Singh's statement against JNU.

                            A sad state of affairs. He was already on the wrong path with his views on various matters. Now he is emboldened by the support from section of the media and political class ensuring no action can be taken against him, however regressive and detrimental his views are with respect to national interest. It is sad that such views by some in JNU are regarded as the epitome of intellect and free speech by some.

                            What kind of shameless creatives are these peoples. One takes hefty salary from Government of India, which is ultimately paid by the taxpayers and the other's education is funded by GOI and both these criticize the very same state which is funding them. Only possible in India.

                            No Indian can accept such comments against our armed forces.Also we condemn this Professor for uttering language questioning the unity and integrity of India.This professor should also be arrested and thrown out of JNU. Government and High Court should take a note of activities of Kahnaiya and Professors of JNU. JNU is a den of anti national activities.Professors of JNU are encouraging and teaching their Maoist/Naxalite ideologies to students who are future of India and can be great danger to Unity and integrity of the Country.Govt should immediately take action and throw these Professors out of JNU. At the same time Kahnaiya and other students booked under sedition must be booked behind the bars, bail cancelled and throw them out of the JNU as they are polluting the atmosphere of the campus.

                            Yeah,  these BJP jokers who  otherwise are quite willing to use the army as bonded labour to  build bridges etc for their crony babas  etc -- suddenly discover their love for our soldiers  when it comes to Kanhaiya. As Kanhaiya rightly said thae army soldiers have more in common  with him than the fake nationalists of BJP.

Kanhayya never insulted army but that doesnt mean there were no fake encounters or rapes by army personels as well.. if a rape is committed by a army jawan, does it make nationalist rape? bhakts has 0 IQ.

                            No one ever support atrocities against anybody, particularly womenfolk !  But, 'we don't see things as they are instead we see things as we are' and that's very bad &amp; alarming - Leftists must change their fascist &amp; biased mind set first !   Kashmiri Pandits lost thier home for ever  - why were they brutally killed ?  Why were they thrown out of their homes ?  Why were the leftists and their stooges in literary &amp; cultural world silent when they were forced to move out their homes and women were raped by the Kashmiri militants ?
