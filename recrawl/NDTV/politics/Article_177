New Delhi:Â HighlightsBJP MP Hema Malini says no one can stop her from starting dance academy
Hema: Won't let politics ruin what I've waited to do for 20 years
Hema Malini allegedly grabbed land worth crores for a nominal price
                                Allegations that she illegally grabbed land for a dance academy at a nominal price notwithstanding, veteran actress-lawmaker Hema Malini asserts no can stop her from from establishing her institute.
A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Bombay High Court last month sought a direction to the city police commissioner to file a case of cheating and forgery against the yesteryear actress and Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse on charges of illegally allotting land.
Ms Malini said she has waited for 20 years to have her own dance academy, where classical dance forms would be taught, and she won't let "politics" ruin her plan.
"I have been waiting for this for 20 years and when I was about to get it so much hullabaloo was created that I got scared. People said, 'You leave it, why are you after this land? I said why should I leave something I have been wanting for so many years," Ms Malini told PTI in an interview."I want to impart my dance my music, I want to make an institute and teach children. How can they stop it? Why are they talking about some bloody politics and spoiling my thought and creation," she asked.
A trained Bharatnatyam dancer herself, Ms Malini said traditional Indian art forms are being distanced by people today and she wants to retain them by imparting co-curricular education to youth.
"Classical dance forms and music are slowly going away. It is very important to impart these to children..."
The 67-year-old actress also feels youngsters should be trained in the art forms of legendary artistes in the country to keep traditions alive.
Referring to the Padma Shri row involving veteran actress Asha Parekh in which Union Minister Nitin Gadkari claimed she lobbied for the award, Ms Malini said artists should be given their due respect, which is beyond these honours.
"There are so many legends in our country, what has government done for them till today? They should be recognised, artistes should be given respect, giving a Padma Shri or a Padma Vibhushan (is not enough) and that too when they run after and ask for it. Artistes want some recognition.
"Institutes should be named after these legendary artistes. Some institute should be named after Lata Mangeshkar. We should train kids in the music and dance of our legends, that's how we can keep the traditions alive."

                            No one is stopping you from opening a dance school you have every right to do so.....Just don't grab a public land for that buy land open a school simple. If you were just waiting for BJP to come in power and reward you for all the work you have done for them then its a deal. <br/><br/>
She should not get a land and if she wants then pay the market price and take it.

                            No one can stop her from anything. She is an MP from the great party. How could anyone dare to say anything? Maybe Zee network will show more doctored videos against anyone who opens their mouth against her. Or maybe they will fit beef in the house of the person who tries to stop her and send Sangeet Som to that house.

                            What a noble thought..... But, such thoughts can only be respected when intentions are noble..... First you grab land which is not yours and at totally underrated prices and secondly, after you setup your so called institution to train children, are you going to provide them free training???? absolutely not.... you will lobby only to the ambanis and adanis who will fill your bank accounts with their black money.... and this is exactly what you have been waiting for all these twenty years.... isn't the writing clear on the wall?????

                            Madam you have postponed your ideas for twenty years. Now you want to start to because you are getting government land. If you are turn lover of dance forms you would not have waited for government to allot land.

                            This is public land she wants at a throwaway price. She needs to clarify a lot of things - who will own the land? Will it be owned by a trust or some organization that she will control? That would be problematic. If its public land, then governance of the dance academy should be govt controlled. <br/><br/>
Besides free land, what other govt support will she get? <br/><br/>
Is she the right person to head such a govt academy? She is an actress. She is not known for her dance abilities. Maybe a veteran dancer would be a better choice. <br/><br/>
It seems that she is using her influence to set up an academy with public funds that she will effectively own and that will help promoter herself. People will not stand for that.

                            If there is any mala fide the allotment should be scrapped. We have had too many cases where public land is usurped ostensibly for public purposes but ultimately lands in private hands. Not only this case, all other similar cases should be examined and the land returned. And evict all those staying in government properties that have been turned into memorials for some worthless politician or the other. There needs to be a stringent law for this.

                            So funny and foolish to say that waited for 20 years to get land (for free) to teach dance!.  You should have spent from your pocket and did that.  I also want to teach many arts, like me lakhs of people are there.  No one gets land from government.  When will you understand Hema Malini???  You may be a good actress and appreciated by all, but in real life you are acting so arrogantly and foolishly.  In fact she was waiting for BJP to come to power.
