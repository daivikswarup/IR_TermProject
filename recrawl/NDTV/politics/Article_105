Kolkata:Â HighlightsActor Anupam Kher: No debate on intolerance, only the rich talk about it
Kher: Congress most tolerant for projecting Rahul as their PM candidate
The actor made these remarks at the Telegraph intolerance debate
                                Only the rich and the famous are talking of intolerance, there is no debate on the issue, actor Anupam Kher said on Saturday.
"This is a no debate. The rich and the famous are talking of intolerance. If you ask a man on the street, they won't talk about intolerance. All they want is food two times a day. Those with a champagne in a glass are only talking about it. Are you living in India or America," Mr Kher said at the Telegraph National Debate on intolerance in Kolkata.
He said the "biggest" form of intolerance in the country was during the emergency when all those people who spoke against the government were jailed.
Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, he said, "Congress is the most tolerant in India because they are tolerating a person whom they want to project as a prime minister of this country".
"If you can tolerate that person then you can tolerate anything in the world. This is ridiculous. Did you hear the word intolerance before the last eight months? This has been marketed to take revenge for the defeat in the last elections," Mr Kher said, adding, corruption is "not being talked about" in the last two years while in the last ten years corruption was the most talked about topic.
AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said in the last two years it has often appeared that intolerance is now part of the mainstream discourse.
Bollywood actress Kajol said there are different types of intolerance and political intolerance is only one of them.
"To make all social issues a political one is absolutely wrong. I also think that We have to work together to make a stronger and richer India and only then intolerance cease to exist. The debate on intolerance does not recognise this," she said.

                            Anupam Kher, You mean Rohith And Kanhaiya are rich. Common men don't talk about intolerance not because of its absence but due to their preoccupation in earning bread without butter. Tolerance debate is not just about religion, it is also about caste, poverty and other important issues dogging our masses. Do not attempt to limit this debate to just a conflict between Hindus and Muslims. Get out of your ivory tower, remove your saffron glasses and mingle with the people to get a feel of what are the ground realities.

                            He is playing around with the sentiments of Kashmiri Pandit's.why did he not March to the PMO demanding rehabilitation of pandits in J&amp;K.He is only maintaining that the previous govt's have neglected the issue.He wants to be in the good books of Modiji so that he can get a berth for himself in the parliament but he must understand that we have a very strong PM who can identify the genuine from fake and all his drama can never impress the PM , he will never get the much coveted seat in the parliament.Henceforth he must focus on the one best thing he is capable of  acting and earn his bread with dignity without having to lick  any ones feet.jai hind.

                            It is always the rich &amp; famous who got access to the chatter box. But the poor use their vote, and they spoke with their votes in 2014.

                            The comments of rich and famous make headlines whereas comments of common man and poor do not. Hope Anupam Kher is listening.
