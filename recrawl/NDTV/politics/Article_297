New Delhi:Â                             Amid a war of words between the government and opposition over his sudden 'disappearance' from the country, External Affairs Ministry on Thursday said it has not been asked to take any action against liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is facing legal proceedings for alleged loan defaults by his group to the tune of over Rs. 9000 crore.
"As far as Vijay Mallya is concerned MEA has not been asked to take any action," foreign ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
He was asked if the ministry was taking any action against Mr Mallya, who has left the country, as per the Attorney General's submission in the court on Wednesday.Asked about reports that Mr Mallya was in the UK, the spokesperson said, "We cannot comment on that beyond what the Attorney General said in court."
On Wednesday, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had told the Supreme Court that Mr Mallya left the country a week back.
The court issued a notice to Mr Mallya and sought his response within two weeks on pleas filed by a consortium of banks seeking direction for freezing his passport and his presence before the top court.
Since the court was informed that Mr Mallya has already left the country, probably for the UK, it allowed the plea of the Attorney General that the notice to him can be served through his official Rajya Sabha Email ID, Indian High Commission at London and also through counsel representing him before various high courts, Debt Recovery Tribunal and also through his Company.

                            The news is that the foreign ministry was not asked to stop mallaya as there was no court order. But NDTV is presenting the news as if the govt had helped him. Ask any kannadiga and he will tell you about his political clout.

                            Mallya has some obedient politician and a fleet of pets to loot in India and enjoy life in London. The obedient and pets are the real hellish creatures of India. This is the India as a gift of GREAT INDIAN LEADERS IN SIX DECADES to the people. THESE ARE THE WORTHLESS LAWMAKER POSSIBLE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. INDIAN LAWMAKERS ARE THE MOST WORTHLESS LAWMAKERS OF THE WORLD. They allow looters to be protected and common citizens to be looted.
