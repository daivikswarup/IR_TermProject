Patna:Â                             Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Prasad Yadav today alleged that the Centre is not cooperating the Bihar government and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to give something to the state during his visit scheduled for Saturday.
"We have created pressure on the Centre to fulfil Bihar's demands....We will take our rights. The Prime Minister is coming to Bihar on March 12 and he will have to give something to the state," he said.
Mr Yadav, who is also the road construction minister, said this while replying to a debate on the department's budgetary demand of Rs. 6,599.06 crore for next financial year.
He also alleged that the Prime Minister is misleading the nation over the pace of road construction.
"On umpteen occasions, the Prime Minister had said two km roads was being constructed per day during UPA regime and now it is 18 km per day. The Prime Minister is telling a big lie and misleading the nation," said Mr Yadav, who is the youngest son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
Citing NHAI figures, Mr Yadav said 2,844 km roads was constructed in 2012-13, during the UPA rule against 1,501 km of roads in 2014-15 during NDA regime which is 45 per cent less.
Similarly, 2,248 km roads was built in 2011-12 during UPA regime while 1,771 km roads was constructed in 2015-16 during the present dispensation under NDA, he said.
PM Modi will be in Bihar for a day to participate in the Patna High Court centenary celebrations programme on Saturday.
He would also dedicate the Digha-Sonepur rail-cum-road bridge at Hajipur.

                            What about Bihar Package announced before Bihar elections? Modi should be reminded of that because at this age he may become forgetful.
