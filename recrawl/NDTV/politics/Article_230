New Delhi: HighlightsNDTV Exclusive: Culture Minister sanctioned Rs. 2.25 cr in December
Govt funding to Vyakti Vikas Kendra Trust, run by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
Minister: Govt routinely backs events that promote tourism
                                As India's top environmental court today decided to give the go ahead to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's huge cultural festival on the banks of the River Yamuna with conditions and Rs. 5 crore fine, union ministers like Mahesh Sharma and Babul Supriyo defended the event, saying that the organisers have sought all required clearances.
NDTV has accessed details which show that in December, the Ministry of Culture, headed by Mahesh Sharma, sanctioned Rs. 2.25 crore for the three-day event of Sri Sri's Art of Living Foundation.The government funding was allotted to the Vyakti Vikas Kendra Trust in Bengaluru, run by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, as part of the Culture Ministry's programme of Financial Assistance to Cultural Organisations.
The festival is scheduled to start on Friday; its posters show the Ministry of Culture as one of a number of supporting organisations. The event, being organised over 1,000 acres, will damage the fragile ecosystem of the Yamuna, allege environmentalists who have taken the Art of Living Foundation to court.
 

Sanjeev Bhargava of the organisation SEHER, which organises cultural events, says a grant worth more than Rs. 2 crore from the government for an individual event is unheard of. "Normally, the Ministry at best would agree to give Rs. 15-20 lakh," he said. Bigger amounts, he says, are given as sustenance grants to organisations for an entire year.
Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, however, said that "the government routinely supports events that promote tourism and culture" and that "they (the organisers) have not done anything illegal or in clandestine manner."
It is true that the construction of a humongous stage, telecom towers, and installation of more than 600 portable toilets have been going on for weeks. With the National Green Tribunal making sharp observations about the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the potential damage to the environment, government agencies have, in quick succession, denied sanctioning the World Culture Festival.
But the organisers don't seem in need of funding. According to its submissions to the Ministry, the trust that received the government grant declared expenses of more than Rs. 100 crore in 2012 and over 90 crores the next year.

                            When did the breathing technique become a cultural event? Donation by government and government entities based on religion and pseudo culture should be banned altogether.

                            Good to know where my hard earned money taken through various taxes like multiple cess etc is being spent on. On top of this they even wanted a share of our PF amount also.

                            Farmers dying by the hundreds because their crops have failed and these clowns give Rs 2.25 crores to this man for some bizarre yoga event. Are they out of their minds?

                            I'm afraid the damage is already done. It's incredible to see how colluding parties can throw all caution to the winds and have their way.  Deeply regrettable.  AOL may well go ahead with the event. But their image and that of their leader is tarnished forever.

                            @Jacob: Why does not anyone question when there are grants given to people for religious piligrimage outside India, or for Christian missionaries. We Indians are becoming a bunch of Hypocrites, and only question those who are not considered as vote-banks.

                            Go in details of the amount collect you will see a big bunch of amount came from cooperates and govt orgnisations like  Ministry of Culture sanctioned. Also checked their earlier event accounts and other accounts like amount generation from courses. Also check whether they issue receipt to indiviual to whom they collect amount and issued 80G to them. Teachers worked as agent who got min 10% of the total generation of course (Part-1 course fee for A Grade Cities for 3 or 6 days is Rs. 2500/- to Rs. 3000/- etc) and for residential courses approx Rs. 6000/- to Rs. 8000/- for A grade cites). Here in later courses teachers have fixed 3 to 5 thousand + 10% of collection
