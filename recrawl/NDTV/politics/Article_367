                                                        Sri Sri Ravi Shankar talks to NDTV on green court's order.Here are the highlights:The magnitude of work, everyone normally welcomes it. Where people unite, 37,000 artists together on a stage like a cultural Olympics5 years ago we did a similar thing in Berlin, Germany.There is this schism in society where we don't trust each other. This event will provide balm to the people.We just wanted a piece of land and we said we will sweep the place and organise an eventIn India, one can be fined even when one follows all rulesWe have photos of every stage and we are going to present this in CourtWe have told the whole world about the programme, lakhs of people will comeIf someone says cultural activity is not recreation, nothing can be more bafflingIt is the World Cultural Event, it is being done for the public and bridges are for security onlyI have no regrets. I am happy that the stench of Yamuna is not there anymore when we reached there.

                            It is still a private event irrespective of the number of people participating.  How does number of people define whether it is private or not?  Anyway, the question is whether the event should be held where there is a judicial ruling against it?  This is a clear case of political patronage and misuse by the governing authorities.  Mark my words - this will become permanent structure!!!

                            The godman has the audacity to say he will not pay the fine only because he is well protected in the political echelons. Sri Sri, Baba Ramdev, Yogi adithyanath, Sadvi Prachi these are the people ruling the roost in this country today. What a shame !!

                            Ravishankar may have lakhs of followers but unfortunately he is a common man in the sight of law. He may have had similar event in other country but even a layman knows that there is something called law of land, everyone must follow the law wherever they are. He says the whole world knows about the program but does not get necessary clearance from the depts. Honestly, 4 football field size stage with huge landscape is a PIECE of land for ravi!! Can I a common man have 1/1000th portion of such land free?? It's shear arrogance knowing that the whole govt is backing him with crores. Don't worry Ravi, Feku will take care of the fine!! Real Acche din!!

                            He says its a public function, hence Army was used for labor class job ??? Few years ago when IPL, a sporting event organised by a government body like BCCI was denied support &amp; security because the CRPF and local police could not be stretched due to elections. IPL had to be shifted out to South Africa. Why was Army not called in for the IPL even if they could be called in for a religious event now ??

                            Ravi shankar ji..you might have amassed lot of good will in 35 years but with this program you have lost all that. <br/>
I think you need to attend some training program on what is a public event or private event. Mere attendance of people or some dance/bhajan activities doesn't make it a public event. <br/><br/>
In fact this insistence of yours goes on to prove how much you don't know which is the reason why you have exploited your relation ship with PM to make army work for you

                            Sri Sri, If you have that kind of money why don't you do something better instead of organizing a cultural  event, you could partly (or wholly) sponsor the ISRO's satellite launch, build toilets, build schools, hospitals, something that will do a lot of good for our people, instead of merely congregating in huge numbers.

                            Mr Balasubramanium - please have your head examined. How is he not a private person?? Just bcoz you and a few others have defined him as God. In a country of illiterates its very easy to become one!! and wealth and flashing of it with some asanas thrown in earns a lot of respect from illiterate masses. Dont be one of them.

                            Really sad that a cultural event which would done great pride to India has put to this fate by the unimaginative and imprudent planning by the organisers. Law of the land should apply equally and any aberration is unacceptable under any pretext. This is just another instance. Surprised at the NGT finding that even though the act is illegal, it can not be stopped as much preparation has already been done. It should have been more rational and just to stop any act found illegal even though it is ongoing at the very moment when it is found illegal. In any case this is not such a thing that it can not be postponed or changed to another location.

                            Thanks to media, Sonia Gandhi and her missionaries we have a perfect case of someone's reputation being destroyed only because he is promoting yoga, which is Hindu in nature. Sri Sri might have went overboard in preparation for this event but nothing could be farther from truth than saying that it is a private event.
