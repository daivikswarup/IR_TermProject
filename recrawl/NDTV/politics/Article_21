Ludhiana:                             Two unidentified assailants today fired shots at a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Shakha but there were no casualties as the ground was vacant, at new Kidwai Nagar Park, police said.
The incident took place today when two motorcycle- borne persons fired shots at the Shakha ahead of the assembly sangh sanyamsevaks, they said.
The eyewitnesses said that sound of two gun shots were heard.
Police said that the unidentified miscreants were wearing monkey caps and hence could not be identified.
DCP Narinder Bhargva said that the police party rushed to the spot after receiving the information. No one was injured in the firing as assembly of sangh sanyamsewaks was yet to start, the DCP said.
It may be recalled that terrorists attacked RSS Shakha at Dresi ground in Ludhiana in May 1991 in which five volunteers were gunned down and 15 others were badly injured.
