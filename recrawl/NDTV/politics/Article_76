Bihat:Â                             Away from the bustle of International Women's Day celebrations, Meena Devi, mother of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, is worried over the life threat to her son and has demanded adequate security for him.
"I am tense for my son's safety and security following death threat to him by Hinduvta forces," Meena Devi, in her early 50s, told news agency IANS today.
"If Kanhaiya was attacked in the court, who will guarantee us of his security when he has returned to JNU campus and will visit outside campus," Ms Meena Devi, who works as 'sevika' at an Anganwadi centre, said.
"My son is also son of the country, his security is concern of the government. Kanhaiya's life is under threat, I am worried," she said. "We can only ask the government to ensure his safety and security. It is for the government to decide."
Ms Meena Devi recalled that she, her husband Jai Shankar Singh and other family members were happy after Mr Kumar was released on bail.
"Our happiness did not last long... We are afraid for his safety and security," she said.
"Hinduvta forces can target Kanhaiya for his pro-people stand and his vocal support for freedom from hunger to poverty and casteism," she added.
Mr Kanhaiya's home village Bihat is hardly three km from Barauni town in Begusarai district, considered a stronghold of the Left politics in Bihar.

                            Ammaji it is we who need security from that criminal nalayak beta of yours. His followers are on the spree and have hacked a rss man in kerala today. If you are so worried about his safety you should have given him good views about society and not the leftists. Now please keep him at home and save our nation.

                            Anarchism and Anti-national activities, under the Garb of Azadi for expression, is THE  way to get "comfort, richness and prominence".
