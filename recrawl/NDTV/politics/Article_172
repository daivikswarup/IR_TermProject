                                Eight Maoists, including five women, were killed in a gun-battle this morning on the border between Chhattisgarh and Telangana. A local Maoist commander is among those killed, say the police.
Officials said the Telangana and Chhattisgarh police launched a joint operation after learning that notorious Maoist leader Hari Kishan was hiding in the forests in the Khammam region.
Sources say the Greyhounds, an elite anti-Maoist force set up by Andhra Pradesh, led the operation. Chhattisgarh has sent choppers to the site.
Weapons including AK-47 rifles and explosives have been found along with the bodies of the Maoists, say police sources.

                            Doesn't matter if they were children or women. They were Maoists. They have milled hundreds of our CRPF personnel. Let's stop thinking with a Leftist ideology and kills these enemies of the land. <br/><br/>
I'm sorry to say this but we should "learn" from Pakistan. Yeah, Pakistan. The Pakistani government has changed so many criminals in the last year or two that the crime rate and terrorism has considerably come down there. That's what happens what people fear the law. And here in India the Supreme Court stays the death sentence of a criminal because of some petitions by "Human Rights activists". <br/><br/>
How can a person who denies another person's human rights have human rights?<br/><br/>
It's time we went hard on terror. Don't listen to Shashi Tharoor's ideas of abolishing death sentence. He's an elitist with fascist ideas. Look at USA(where death sentence is in existence) not UK.
