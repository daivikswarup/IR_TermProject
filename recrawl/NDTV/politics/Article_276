New Delhi:Â                             India will spare no efforts to rescue father Tom Uzhunnalil, who has gone missing in Yemen after the ISIS terrorist group attacked a care home run by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
"Yemen is a conflict zone. We do not have Embassy there. But we will spare no efforts to rescue Father Tom Uzhunnalil," External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted.
The minister noted that though there was Indian Embassy in Yemen, there was a camp office in Djibouti. She also corrected the number of Indians killed in the attack from four to one.
Gunmen stormed the refuge for the elderly on Friday, killing a Yemeni guard before tying up and shooting 15 other employees.
Four foreign nuns, including an Indian, working as nurses were among those killed.
