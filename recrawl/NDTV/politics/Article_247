New Delhi:Â HighlightsOpposition showers praise on Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in Lok Sabha
AAP MP Bhagwant Maan: Swaraj doing good job saving our people abroad
BJD MP and RJD MP join AAP MPs in praising Swaraj during question hour
                                In a rare moment of bonhomie between the treasury and opposition benches in parliament, union External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today earned praise from the opposition members in the Lok Sabha.
"I want to thank Sushma Swaraj ji. She is doing an exceptionally good job to save our people abroad," Aam Aadmi Party's Bhagwant Maan said in the Lok Sabha during question hour.
"Recently, 13 people of my constituency were made slaves in Saudi Arabia. I went to meet external affairs ministry officials who acted immediately. As a result, all these people and eight others were saved and finally returned safely," Mr Maan said.
Another AAP parliamentarian Dharamveer Gandhi also hailed the minister.
"I will not ask any question. I have stood up only to thank the minister. We always get her help whenever needed. She has done a lot for the people of Punjab," Mr Gandhi said.
Biju Janata Dal leader Baijayant Panda also praised Ms Swaraj, saying, "As a minister, her response has been outstanding."
Rashtriya Janata Dal member Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav hailed the external affairs minister for her reply in Hindi even though the questions were put in English.
"I will thank Sushma ji for speaking in Hindi. Despite questions being asked in English, she has replied in Hindi, which is good. There are some members in the house who despite knowing Hindi very well, respond only in English," he said.
At this point, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan wondered aloud: "There is no question but thanks only!"
On her part, the minister thanked all the members for their encouragement.
"I thank all those who thanked me," she said with folded hands.

                            Few ministers are working hard and giving results to the nation - Sushma Swaraj in MEA, Nitin Gadkari in Road &amp; Transport, Suresh Prabhu in Railways, Piyush Goyal in Power &amp; Coal. I wish Rajnath Singh in Home Ministry also works like them and improves the corrupt police force of India. The country needs bold, unprecedented and never before reforms in many sectors, police being one of them.

Smriti is doing fine but her work is also the toughest. She has to clean the filth of last 30-40yrs of commie hegemony in education system of India.

                            Madam Sushma is one of the BJP finest persons. I wonder whether she can take over the education ministry from Smriti Irani she just do a lot of drama in the floor of the house. Smriti Irani didnt do any work in the ground, apart from dividing the country and writing letters to the VC torturing students based on caste. I am 100% sure Madam Sushma would have handled the issue in the Indian Interest. I hope Prime Minister Modi appeciates Sushma too. I also want to thank you Madam Sushma for her relentless work to the Indians abroad, thank you thank you and please do you have any chance to take over the education ministry that would be awesome.

                            Just a few months back, the same people had asked for her resignation: For allegedly helping Lalit Modi while he was being chased by various Indian Govt agencies. To top it, her daughter was one of Lalit Modi's lawyers and her husband had business relations with Lalit.

                            So an MP thanks the minister because she replied in Hindi despite the question being asked in English by a person who knew Hindi. The same thing cuts the other way, my dear. If a person who knows English very well replies to a person south of the Vindhya mountains in Hindi, despite the latter not knowing the language, no one calls it as the now infamous word - "Intolerance"
