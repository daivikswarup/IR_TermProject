                                An Air India flight made an emergency landing today at the Bhopal airport moments after take-off, after a bird hit one of its engines.
The Mumbai-bound Air India Flight 634 returned to the airport immediately because of an engine failure, an official said.
"A bird was sucked into the right engine 5-6 minutes after take-off," said Vishrut Acharya, an Air India official.
"The engine is being serviced... we are making sure all passengers will be flown to their respective destinations today," he added.
The passengers were sent to a hotel and are likely to be put on another flight to Mumbai in the afternoon.
The flight is expected to take off soon after repairs.

                            Why not report it like, Air India Pilot Lands the plane safely after bird hit Engine? Remember Sullenberger who was hailed a hero after landing in the Hudson? This is just one engine, but it takes a lot of guts and skill to land it safely after a bird hit. The heading is like Air India made an emergency landing coz they din fuel the plane enough. Lol.
