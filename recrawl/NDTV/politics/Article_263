Jammu:Â                             Jammu and Kashmir Congress today blamed BJP and PDP for the ongoing political uncertainty in the state and accused them of "hoodwinking" the people.
"BJP and PDP are responsible for the present political crisis and chaos in the state. Only Congress represents aspirations of the people and this is the party which can ensure justice to the people of all the three regions of the state," Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee president Ghulam Ahmed Mir told a rally in Khour area of Jammu.
Referring to the stalemate over government formation in the state, Mir accused PDP and BJP of misleading people in the name of agenda of alliance.
"People are being treated as slaves by both the parties and the present political drama staged by them is another attempt to hoodwink the people like they did in the Assembly elections," Mr Mir said.
