Nalanda, Bihar:                             A Bihar lawmaker, accused of raping a minor, has surrendered in a court in Nalanda district. The surrender came a month after an arrest warrant was issued in his name.
Raj Ballabh Yadav, who was suspended by his party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days.
The lawmaker from Nawada has been accused of raping a minor girl at his home on February 6. He has been absconding since the girl's family lodged a complaint on February 9 and an arrest warrant was issued by Deputy Inspector General of Police Shalin.
His anticipatory bail plea got rejected by a court.
A court in Bihar Sharif town had ordered that Mr Yadav's property be attached. The government suspended the licenses of his three fire arms -- a rifle, a pistol and a double-barrelled gun.
Mr Yadav served as minister in the Rabri Devi government in the past.
"We will take him on police remand soon. His surrender has only happened because of sustained pressure by the police," said Sunil Kumar, Additional Director General of the Bihar Police.

                            Under BJP government, criminals get protection; under Nitish they rightly get arrested. BJP MLA in Delhi was bragging about assaulting the people in the court premises. So, where is the Jungle Raj?
