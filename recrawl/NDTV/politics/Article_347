New Delhi: HighlightsIn Rajya Sabha, PM Modi rebuts Congress' criticism of government policies
PM: You're seeing my work with a microscope but never critiqued your own
PM: If we attack Congress, it's reported as an attack on opposition
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi quoted from a Nida Fazli ghazal to throw a challenge to the opposition, particularly the Congress, in his reply in the Rajya Sabha to the motion of thanks on the President's Address today.
The lines from the ghazal translate to, "If you have the courage, then show me you can tread my path."
The tone of the PM's speech in the Upper House was less combative than the one in the Lok Sabha last week, where he had taken on Rahul Gandhi in a point-by-point rebuttal of the Congress vice-president's speech attacking the government during the debate in that house.The PM's counter-attack on the Congress, however, continued. "Death has a blessing. It never gets blamed for anything. If somebody dies, the blame goes to reasons like cancer, age... Death itself is never blamed or defamed. Sometimes I feel that Congress also has this blessing... Congress never gets the blame," PM Modi said in the Rajya Sabha, where the Congress is the largest party and the government is in a minority.
He rebutted the criticism of Congress leaders of his government's policies by detailing schemes and initiatives, also telling the opposition party, "You are looking at my work through a microscope. Had you used but a binocular and critiqued your own initiatives while you were in power then it would have been better."
The Prime Minister also added, "If they had done so much hard work when they were in power, they wouldn't be here," blaming previous Congress governments for the challenges and crises the country finds itself in. "What we have inherited from you... We are getting tired trying to clean up the mess," PM Modi said.
When the Opposition benches raised a noise over his reiteration that the government aims at doubling farmer incomes by 2022, PM Modi said, "I'm not an economist like Manmohan Singh, I don't have his immense intellect. But I'm from a humble upbringing, have witnessed hardships of poverty... Can farmer incomes be doubled by 2022? If we make sure that soil health cards are used effectively then yes it's a real possibility."
Dr Manmohan Singh, PM Modi's predecessor is a Congress lawmaker in the Rajya Sabha and was present in the House.

                            Congress senseless behavior will put them at single digit from 44 seats. GST or any other reform bill is necessity, and one can not  disturb the Parliament by raising issues like, Kanhaia or Vemula. India is wast country and there are number of sad incidence occurred every day in one part or another. NDA is eligible for big salute, as their sincerity and efforts remained terrific. Now they should do those things, where parliament approval is not require. People will punish RaGa and others (who looted the country for years) for their negative attitude. No media house can save such people.

                            Feku can only play victim card to hide his inefficiency... Was Congress not blamed for 2G scam, CWG scam, Coal scam &amp; rightly so. Those who are running the show, if not performing well will be blamed. Congress is not ruling now, so why blame Congress. Do some good work for the country and people will praise your work. Well now, if you are still wondering why people are blaming  you see the list. 1) Prise Rise   2) You promised the moon on black money issue, but no visible progress. 3) Inspite of crude hovering $30, petrol prices is still hight 4) half baked policy without visible outcome 5) Cess after cess. There are lot more but these are non political ones, list of political is endless

                            This is where Congress is winning. Maharashtra Beef Ban, Riots, Church attacks, and mismanagement of JNU. BJP needs to learn more lessons, but should not get tired of all these mud-slinging should go ahead with reforms

                            I have not seen such a nautanki person like him. It is unfortunate that we people have elected such a illetrate communal and fake person on supreme position of prime minister. I don't think having so many literate and educated persons in India still now a days such a environment has created that we are divided into 2 groups. After more than 69 years  of independent our generation will still need to prove the patriotism because of this silent goon and his battalion.

                            Actually Modi lies,that were told to grab votes , before elections have been exposed. And then on, people have started looking for alternative. Congress started capitalising on that and it seemed to work. Modiji, you should not have lied in the first place.

                            Bas abb rone pe a gaye! for two years all he has done is calls names to Congress. And today he accepts in his speech that all work were started by previous govt. He is just carrying it forward. Calling names and taunting the opposition in his every para of the speech...I think he is making more enemies than friends in the house. I think he brings such bad repute to the position of a PM. Mr. Yechurry had a point when he said if the PM can call out our names and taunt us we should be given a chance to respond back to him.

                            Farmers suicides have increased in India. Half of the existing farmers would be in the graves in 2022. So automaticaly the income of remaining farmers will double. Bravo PM, you arr always with the calculations.

                            @Master: If Congress has even a drop of shame they should cooperate with PM in his efforts for all round development of India. In spite of all the criticisms Mr. Modi has shown his sincerity in making India strong. Thanks to his leadership.

                            Is he whining? What's the meaning of opposition? What did he do differently when he was in Opposition, praise all the action of the ruling? With responsibility comes accountability? Instead of looking who is complaining why doesn't he address what's at fault? Maybe he meant Army constructing Shri Shri's stage 'Make in India' project and with his yagna India will prosper. Everyone chant 'Ache din aagaya'

                            This is what BJP did last 10 years like criticizing govt actions  ... Why couldn't BJP use binocular now and look into common people problem ? why are they only worried about corporate problems? why are they not taking any action against bribe , black money? despite crude oil price came down to 35 $ from 130 $ , why petrol/diesel  price not reduced much? other countries reduced oil price to 50% ? why not in India?  why is our govt support GMO when most countries are supporting organic farming ?

                            I think  there are lot of people like  Mani Shanker on NDTV comments page who just cant digest Modi.<br/><br/>
Everybody knows  that  some of the ministers  in Modi government  are doing very well ( Piyush Goel , Gadkari , Sushma).<br/><br/>
Most of the people in the world and India know  that  this intolerance thing is being marketed by Media  for the opposition it was always there and will stay there  irrespective of any government.<br/><br/>
If you ask  me who is the most nuatanki politician today  , I 'll  say Arvind K  , Modi has  promised few things  and not delivered  but we can punish him when  he asks  for  votes in 2019  by not electing him.<br/><br/>
For  gods sake as Indians let the government work as its been elected by us  for 5 years  and throw it out if it is not up to our expectation in 2019.<br/><br/>
If we can let a lame government to work for 10 years (UPA )  why  not let this govt work for 5 years as few good things seems to be happening besides the media and opposition being trying there best to uproot this government before 5 years.<br/><br/>
We as Indians have been through bad times with other govt  emergency , war etc  situation today are far better.<br/><br/>
Media as a whole is  not at all helping they are just worried about  TRP and are trying to sensationalize anything which is not relevant.<br/><br/>
My only suggestion to the  Indian  people is please introspect and think  what is good for the country and let the government work  we will get our chance in 2019  and can decide Modi stays or goes , we have given him 5 years  so  let him work.<br/><br/>
As a Indian  we are where we are after more than 65 years of our independence everyone knows which party has ruled the most number of years and  most  responsible for where we are.<br/><br/>
Opposition can unite or divide  but people of the country  are smart  and will elect  who  they think is the best in 2019.
