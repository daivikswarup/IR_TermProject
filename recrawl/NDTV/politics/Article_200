Headline::::'Modiji's Fair And Lovely Yojna To Convert Black Money,' Says Rahul Gandhi



DateTime::::2016-03-03T07:35:09+05:30



New Delhi:Â                             Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi addressed lawmakers in Lok Sabha, attacking the Modi government over black money among other issues. He said Modiji brought a 'Fair and Lovely Yojna' to convert black money into white and blamed him of destroying UPA's work against insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir and terrorism.Here are the highlights of Rahul Gandhi's Parliament address:There's Modi Ji 'Fair and Lovely Yojna', kale dhan to kaise gora banaya jaye (How to convert black money into white).Modi ji had promised employment. When you ask people have they been given employment, nobody is raising their hands.Modi ji said I have not seen a scheme as bad as MGNREGA. He said it is a failed scheme and it has destroyed the nation, but I will not remove it so people can see UPA's mistake.But Arun Jaitley came to me and said that it's a very good scheme. I told him, why don't you say this to your boss?When money was allotted to MGNREGA, I closed my eyes and thought it was Chidambaram presenting the Budget.On the JNU rowThe JNU students' union president Kanhaiya Kumar gave a 20-minute speech on the JNU campus. I have heard the speech. He never said a word against the country, and you have still put him in jail.The income of 40 per cent of the students' parents in JNU, is less than Rs. 6,000. Why are you behind JNU? Because they are poor, weak, Dalits and Tribals? You want them to stay behind? We will not let this happen. You will not be able to crush JNU or the poor of the country.I want to speak a little bit about religion. Tell me, which book says that we should thrash our teachers. Why were JNU teachers, students and media beaten outside the Patiala House courts? And when they were, why did your government not even say a word?On RSSYou have been taught by your RSS teachers that there's only one truth in the universe - Your Own.That nobody's opinion matters. PM can't run the country based on just his own opinion.
	Country is not the PM, and PM is not the country.On the Naga Peace AccordPM said that he'd solved the Nagaland crisis. Our Chief Ministers had not briefed us about anything, so we called them and they said they hadn't heard anything of the sort.Even the Home Minister had no idea about this. Did he know about the accord? Did the Nagaland chief minister know about the accord?And where has it gone now? Gone with the wind?On India-Pakistan relationsPakistan sent trained killers into the heart of Mumbai. 200 people killed, butchered. The op to stop them was on, our soldiers, citizens dying.Our government begged the then CM of Gujarat, not to go to Mumbai. And he went there and grabbed his headlines while our people died.It is the work in J&K that the UPA did, that makes us proud. By the end we had broken the back of insurgency.But what does the PM do? He decides to have a cup of tea with Nawaz Sharif.PM destroyed our work in Jammu and Kashmir when he went to meet Pakistan PM Nawaz. This is because he thinks only his opinion matters.He did not consult the country's able bureaucrats and experts. he disrespected the flag and destroyed the conversations with the country's citizens.PM just has to listen to his country, listen to Rajnath Singh ji, Smriti Irani ji, Sushma Swaraj ji. Listen to your MPs.We are not your enemies, listen to us as well, we don't hate you. Just give the people the dignity of their word and listen to them.

                            Even after 10 years of experience as politician, he doesn't able to come out of KG of political student.<br/><br/>
His speech doesn't make any sense. He forgets that he speaks in parliament (and not in public / election rally) and as one of the tallest leader of Congress. His speech should be like statements and should have power that all MPs should forced to listen themselves instead of laughing on him.<br/><br/>
He is following path of Mr. Sindhiya, Mr. Pilot, Mr. Gagoi, Mr. Hooda - all these are dynasty leaders and elected mainly because of their father's name. Following him RG is taking himself at bottom of bottom level.

                            Is this for real? Rahul Gandhi is so stupid and immature that every word emanating from his mouth is only good for larvae food. A man with a criminal charge along with his mother is behaving typically like a mafioso, insensitive and oblivious of his sins. The whole Congress should be ashamed of a man like RG, but neigh, not so because everyone of them has cheated and robbed India not only of its wealth of money but also knowledge and spirituality.

                            I think what Rahul has said on the floor of the house is enough to cause worry in the minds of treasury benches including PM. The govt. has failed to maintain its words on black money at the same time it has opened the door for legitimizing black in to white through a meager amount of interest forget about penalty. They do not talk about Rs.15L each in the account of common man which they had promised during elections now they have taxed doubly the hard earned money of poor people in EPF account. What a gift the new govt. is being given by the govt.on daily basis. Rahul Gandhi has rightly said that present govt. is anti poor and anti dalits and according to them whosoever is in disagreement of the central govt. or BJP or RSS is anti national as their definition of patriotism and nationalism has been drafted by Nagpur which is not acceptable to most of the Indians. Thus their action on Kanhaiya and other students in JNU is really inspired by fascist ideology based on principals inspired by Adolf Hitler Who is villain of world and it is more so in the case of Present govt.which is a product of Nagpur.

                            Now bhakts who love nautankis of their leaders won't find a sane voice very pleasurable. But truth is Mr. Rahul Gandhi speaks the truth that many of us feel about BJP/RSS. The one statement that "I am not from RSS, I make mistake." means those people don't know whether they are lying or making mistake as they don't care what the truth or right thing is.

                            Sorry Rahul, can't take this. For 10 years when you were in power you did nothing. For 60 years that your party was in power, we still have people below poverty line, worst Human Development Index, the lot of Muslims remain unchanged (Saachar Committee Report), Dalits still ostracised...and the list goes on. Today you've the cheek to advice the Govt/PM? Time to change your sycophant speechwriters Rahul.

                            I may not fully agree with the content, but I think it is a good speech. We have to listen to each other and give respect to each other. Or else we will become a different type of Taliban ruled country.

                            Any one supporting RG and Congress have to be crook and scam artist. And if ever RG become a PM then he'll will become loose and scams and corruption will reach height of Himalayas. India and Indian will be better off without Gandhi dynasty if not then your children's future will be ruined for next generation. This mentally retarded Idiot is no good to become  Sarpanch of a village.  Only crooks and corrupt scam artist only will make him a leader so what out for people who walk with Rahul. At least learn a lesson from Robert Vadras Haryana Land scams.

                            It is clear someone has listed all these and he said all these to make sure that people take him seriously. Rather than a list of issues, why don't u concentrate on taking up one at a time and make sure it reaches a logical conclusion.

                            India and Indian will be better of without scam artist and corrupt congress.  In sixty years even poor congress leader become a rich with black money.  This Gov. Giving them opportunity to come out clean if not same congress will blame Gov. For witch hunting. India and Indian will be better of without Rahul and Gandhi dynasty. Rahul is not even worth to become Sarpanch of a smallest village.  Only corrupt and Scam artist will make him a leader so watch out for those people.

                            The problem with RAGA is, he wants more time, 4 months not enough. He wants to bring all his SWISS/ITALY/COLUMBIA money to India. It takes lot of time..

                            "But what does the PM do? He decides to have a cup of tea with Nawaz Sharif."<br/>
It is like blame to whatever Modi do. If Modi reaches Nawaz for peaceful resolution of issue, he get blamed. <br/>
If Modi does not reach to Nawaz, even then he would be blamed for not reaching to him for peaceful negotiations.

                            Pappu Gandhi again vomiting the mugged up lines from his notebooks. I don't know why parliament's time is wasted for such a moron. He raised many questions as usual just to get some limelight but I have one question for the Nation - that who could tolerate if Pappu Gandhi becomes PM. Real emigration of people would take place then, and only such morons and poor foolish voters would remain.
