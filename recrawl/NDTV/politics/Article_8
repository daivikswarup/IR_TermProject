Headline::::Vijay Mallya Tweets, 'Did Not Flee, Am An International Businessman'



DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:38:29+05:30



New Delhi:                             Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who faces pressure to repay nearly a billion dollars owed to banks by his collapsed airline, tweeted early this morning that he is "not an absconder" and would comply with the law.
In a series of tweets, Mr Mallya also alleged a "witch-hunt" by the media.

The 60-year-old industrialist reacted to reports that he left the country despite a warning or look-out notice to airports to stop him from flying abroad. It has emerged that the CBI had changed the nature of the lookout notice to "providing information about his travel plans".
A group of 17 banks owed enormous debt by Mr Mallya's grounded Kingfisher Airlines had asked the Supreme Court to stop him from leaving the country but the government told the court that he had left on March 2.
Mr Mallya, dubbed the "king of good times" over his extravagant lifestyle and larger-than-life persona, was granted huge loans by many state-run banks without adequate security for his Kingfisher Airlines even though it was clear the company was collapsing.
His departure, possibly to the UK, in the middle of attempts to recover the unpaid debts caused a row in Parliament yesterday, with the Congress charging the government with being a party in his "escape".

                            So Mr Mallya, from your tweet you made it look like your intentions are good. So you should also give a date by when you will clear all your debt? <br/>

                            Sounds like a plan Mr. Mallya. Come back and pay the debts and create an example. Would be a good lesson for Ambani's and Adani.

                            You don't need to abscond Mallya when law-keepers are there to protect lawmakers/lawbreakers like you. It seems you are quite sure of your clean act of sponging the financial system sans any personal obligations to repay.

                            Don't take his words for face  value. He played such gimmicks earlier too and all were found fake. Courts and central govt should quickly proceed with recovery process. Also lender banks officials too should be interrogated and arrested.

                            Why is the media making such a hue &amp; cry or the banks getting so worked up ? Past years Mallya has been in &amp; out of the country. No one has touched him till now. Now what happened ?

                            He is a business man and not a criminal. Media is over reacting. Loss and gain are part of any business. It is criminal if he acted like sathyam raju.

                            The looters of hard earned tax payer's money are protected by Indian politicians and their kith and keens who serve these absconders. The real enemies of India are these politicians and bureaucrats of India. The corrupt politicians are more dangerous than terrorists or enemy countries.

                            Its true. Once media trial starts, everything vanishes. He might have used and misused all the things but without giving him a chance, media made and declared him a culprit. Plz note that I am not at all a supporter on him.
