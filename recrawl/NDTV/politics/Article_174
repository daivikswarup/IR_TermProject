New Delhi:Â                             BJP today hit back at Rahul Gandhi for accusing the government of "crushing" the poor, saying the problems of poverty and unemployment were created by previous Congress governments and the Modi dispensation is working to solve them with its schemes.
Making light of the Congress vice president's charge, BJP said it was a case of "pot calling the kettle black" and alleged that he believed in shouting "untruth" day after day to make it sound credible.
"These are baseless allegations. This is a case of pot calling the kettle black. Congress ruled for 60 years and there is still widespread poverty and unemployment. There is shortage of power and water. They have created these problems while the Modi government is working to solve them.""Whether it is Mudra and life, health and crop insurance schemes, these are aimed at the welfare of the poor and weaker sections," BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said, calling the government pro-poor.
If Mr Gandhi is sincere about benefiting the poor, his party should allow Parliament to run so that issues concerning the poor can be debated and laws aimed at their welfare be passed, he said. "He should do some homework."
Linking the Rohith Vemula and Kanhaiya Kumar issues with rights of the marginalised, Mr Gandhi on Monday accused the government of "crushing" the weak and the poor who demand their rights.

                            congress has a lot to answer to the public! The billions of dollars of corruption during their time would have helped the same poor.
