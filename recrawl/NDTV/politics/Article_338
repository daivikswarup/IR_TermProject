New Delhi: HighlightsCulture Minister declares he will be attending the Sri Sri event
Mahesh Sharma: Opportunity to show India's cultural event across globe
Questions are being raised on extent of govt's involvement in the event
                                As the government faces questions over the extent of its involvement in Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's mega festival on the banks of the river Yamuna, union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma unabashedly declared that he would attend the event.
 
"The law will take its course but as the Culture Minister I want to say that through this event, we have the opportunity to showcase India's cultural events across the globe," Mr Sharma told reporters this morning.
 
"People are coming from all walks of life from all the countries to attend this event. We should respect them and their culture."
 
The three-day World Culture Festival is to start on Friday, but it is shadowed by uncertainty as the National Green Tribunal hears a petition citing grave environmental damage to the Yamuna flood plains.
 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to open the event but concerns of his elite security, the Special Protection Group, makes for a big reason for him to cancel his attendance.
 
His Culture Minister, however, showed no such reservation.
 
Asked whether he would attend the festival, Mahesh Sharma said: "Yes I will."
 
He labored the point that "as cultural minister, I would say that with these kind of events, India's cultural aspect will reach a new height."
 
The government was questioned by the National Green Tribunal how the mega festival was cleared.
 
A seven-acre stage has been set up for over 35,000 artistes and visitors from 150 countries. Art of Living has denied any major construction on the river banks but temporary bridges and mobile towers have been built and dirt tracks and a parking area are also coming up, according to a blueprint accessed by NDTV.
 
Art of Living claims that it has more than 20 approvals for the event.
