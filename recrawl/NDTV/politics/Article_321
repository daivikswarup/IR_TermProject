                                                        The iron gates at the king-size countryside home of Vijay Mallya in England, firmly closed to the media, open mostly to visitors in fancy cars.
An Indian couple decided to try their luck anyway. They have a connection, they insist.
Prabhakar Kaza and his wife Geeta are retired employees of the State Bank of India, which is owed 1,500 crores loaned to Mr Mallya's collapsed airline Kingfisher.
They live 10 miles away from Mr Mallya's home in Tewin village, North of London.
The State Bank leads a group of 17 banks trying to recover nearly Rs. 9,000 crore in debts from Mr Mallya.
"It is an emotional issue for us. We draw pension. We understand he borrowed for business but now it is time to pay back." said Prabhakar Kaza.
Far away from his troubles in India, Mr Mallya is known to locals as "VJ", the "rich man from India" who bought a house from Formula One ace Lewis Hamilton and has a fleet of expensive cars.
"I have seen him around only once not long ago but I keep hearing of him and his love for cars and speed'' said Antony Bill, who lives in Tewin village.
Not far from Queen Hoo road where Mr Mallya's mansion is, Pradeep Kumar runs a convenience store. "His staff often comes here to buy stuff. There is some construction work going on in the property. They tell me interesting stories of his riches and lifestyle." said Mr Kumar.Vijay Mallya has joined the club of high profile and controversial Indians taking shelter in the UK at a time they are wanted by authorities in India.
Britain offers easy access to exotic locations in Europe and extradition from here is a long and complicated process.
Others wanted by Indian authorities are Indian Premier League (IPL) founder Lalit Modi and Tiger Hanif, accused in the 1993 Gujarat bomb attacks.
Mr Mallya owns one of the teams in the cricket league founded by Mr Modi.

                            I am not an economist. I am not sure what this means to Indian economy and finally affects a common man. I can assume a very little, considering huge sums in several political scams. However, having flown KingFisher during Good Times, would like add a fact for the record: Dr. Mallya tried his level best to introduce world class Air Travel Service in India and succeeded to great extent despite losses. He even sold his family silver for a loss making Airlines to keep afloat in the skies, for us to have a 5 star flying experience.<br/>
I am not a shrewd businessman. However, I strongly feel that buying off Air Deccan and paying huge sums to an otherwise worthless Airliner was his only and greatest mishap in running KingFisher. He made business loss there. Mind you, he brought better service flying those Deccan Aircrafts, re-painted and re-branded and almost for the same cost for an Indian Air traveler and adding the world class service that he always believed an Indian should experience during an Air Travel. He is the best host that an Indian businessman can ever be or can ever become. Period.<br/>
As far business loss and settling with banks, I do not know any details and cannot comment. One thing, if any, I have to criticize strongly against Dr. Mallya is â€“ KingFisher not having paid the employees. Whatever the excuse, the employees should have been paid and Dr. Mallya, in exile or not, should arrange to pay the outstanding salaries to the employees. Once done, he is as good as or, in most ways, a better businessman India ever had who treated his customers as guests who visited his home.

                            Rumor Mill--Modi and Mallya collaborating in England with some renowned local thieves. Founded 'West England Company' to run EPL for lucrative employment to English sons of the soil.

                            Britain is a haven for money laundering of illicitly gained money by thugs like Mallya. The law only acts against the poor. This politically connected thug Mallya will live in britain under the protection of the british establishment!

                            Vijay Mallya is an interesting chap. Somehow, I feel sorry for him. I sincerely hope he pays back his  employees with interest at least.

                            Let's see if the intellectuals will use their international connections to get Mallya back to India. This is a genuine cause. Nayantara ji, Mr. Chomsky are you listening?

                            I agree to great extent as all Airlines were in problem till time oil prices dropped. But there was mismanagement also in operations as that was key reason for fall of KF and that included deccan and over spending. <br/>
KF own me also for two flights which got cancelled but they  never returned the money<br/>
Same time a company is separate legal entity different from its shareholders. You can only limited way go to promoters to extent of guarantee  or case of fraud.
