New Delhi:Â HighlightsKilling Rajiv Gandhi LTTE's biggest mistake: Leader's excerpt in new book
LTTE never officially admitted to killing former PM Rajiv Gandhi
Tamil Nadu has written to Centre asking its view on freeing Rajiv killers
                                Assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was the Tamil Tigers' biggest mistake, a new book quotes the late LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham as saying.
Balasingham told Norway's former Special Envoy to Sri Lanka Erik Solheim that LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and his feared intelligence chief Pottu Amman initially denied their involvement in the killing.
But they admitted the truth to Balasingham "a few weeks" after the May 21, 1991 assassination, says Mark Salter's book "To End A Civil War" (Hurst & Company, London).The just released 549-page book is the most exhaustive account of the Norwegian-led peace process that sought to end three decades of conflict in Sri Lanka.
The conflict finally ended when the Sri Lankan military crushed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009, wiping out its entire leadership including Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman.
"Perhaps most controversially, in terms of official LTTE policies, Balasingham conceded that the killing of Rajiv Gandhi was the biggest mistake the LTTE had ever made," says the book.
The LTTE has never officially admitted to killing Mr Gandhi, who was blown up by a Sri Lankan Tamil woman suicide bomber at an election rally near Chennai.
Privately, Balasingham told the Norwegians that Mr Gandhi's killing "was a complete disaster".
According to Mr Solheim, Balasingham put the decision to kill Mr Gandhi to Prabhakaran's desire for revenge for Tamils killed by Indian troops when they were deployed in Sri Lanka in 1987-90, and a belief that Gandhi may again send the troops to Sri Lanka if he returned to power.
Mr Solheim also says that although Balasingham, who in his final year was based in London and died of cancer in December 2006, wanted to reach out to the US and Europe, his real affinity was with India.
"Thus at the end of his life in 2006, Balasingham went so far as to try and 'apologize' to India for this misdeed (assassination)."
After Mr Gandhi's assassination, India outlawed the LTTE - which was earlier based in Tamil Nadu and enjoyed New Delhi's blessings - and declared Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman proclaimed offenders.
In contrast, Balasingham had no hesitation in admitting that the LTTE assassinated moderate Tamil leader and academic Neelan Tiruchelvam - who was critical of the Tamil Tigers -- in July 1999 on a Colombo street.
When the Norwegians, Mr Solheim included, confronted Balasingham on the killing, the book quotes the latter as saying point-blank: "Yes, we killed him and if you listen to me I will tell you why."
The book quotes Solheim as saying that Balasingham once referred to Prabhakaran as a "warlord" and said the LTTE needed to transform into a political entity.
Balasingham also told Mr Solheim, who is now based in Paris: "You must never underestimate the capacity for violence of these guys (LTTE)."
According to Mr Solheim, Balasingham "was very frank with us, including admitting to the LTTE's mistakes.
"Over time I came to regard Bala highly and to consider him as a great human being as well as a good friend."

                            What is the use of publishing the truth now? Will it bring back our assassinated Prime Minister back from the dead? Highlighting this is only going to deepen the wounds of India's countrymen.

                            This is not correct. Rajiv Gandhi was killed because he did not care for Tamils and sent IPKF to help sri lankan army. Sri Lanka used IPKF as sheilds which triggered anger amongst tamil people in Sri lanka.

                            Mr. Rajiv was told by experts (including Mr. PV Narasimha Rao) not to send army to Sri Lanka....He did not listen....paid the price in the end...

                            Food or bad. It's a costly mistake. Rajiv sending ipkf may be a mistake, but what ipkf did to tamilians in SL was a blunder.<br/><br/>
LTTE may have thought that if Rajiv was voted back to power, then there will be more troubles. Hence this blunder.

                            Violence begets violence. Whether it was violence by the Srilankan govt or by the LTTE or by the IPKF, all led to many innocents being killed. But we seem to remember and react only when hi-profile killings. Let there be peace.

                            1. Killing Rajiv was LTTE's biggest blunder.<br/>
2. Similarly, sending IPKF was Rajiv's biggest blunder. Neither of it helped either of them.<br/>
3. Anton was one of the good interface between LTTE and the West. When Anton died in 2006 of natural causes, LTTE lost its best negotiator.<br/>
4. During Ranil's PM period - 2001-2004 - LTTE had a good chance to reform itself into a Political outfit and govern the NE province. They were not satisfied with the Province status, and post-Sep11th LTTE had no chance of winning international sympathy for a seperate country. Their window for freedom closed much earlier. They precipitated their provincial chances when Ranil was offering it.<br/><br/>
Anyways, history is replete with blunders. One more to it.

                            God bless the young soul of Rajiv Gandhi, an untimely departure of a young statesman who gave India advanced technology in every walk of life but remained victim of communal / castiest forces in country during his tenure. Communal / castiest politics dictated the country's politics since 1990's till today, weakening of congress , all proving disastrous for secular democratic india. Only recovery / solution is by reviving the grand old Congress party, it's values which represents entire fabric of Indian republic. BJP just don't represent landia,please understand .

                            Please do not comment here when you do not have any first hand information from a srilankan tamil. I have friends who escaped and studied in India and You would never dream of a downfall. A tourist operator with 100 cabs at colombo of tamil origin came to be a driver in India till his retirement. A tamil tea estate owner landed in inda with nothing to restart life here. A 7 year old girl dumped in a garbage bin to avoid ipkf firing was in India still feeling the trauma of loss of her parents when IPKFkilled the people and burnt their houses on the street in which they lost 2 soliders in street fight with LTTE.

                            1) Come and speak with Srilankan refugees. They will sing you what IPKF did to their women and children. <br/>
2) LTTE didnt jumped out of cocoons. They are oppressed and supressed people who choose to fight back.<br/>
3) Srilankan army didnt crushed LTTE all alone but with aid of atleast 5 other nations.<br/>
4) Killing a statesman like Rajeev is a blunder but its a sum of all wrongful situations

                            The sending of IKPF was the biggest blunder of sending Indians to kill Indians in Lanka. It was aided by Natvar Singh the angry old then  external minister.

                            It shouldn't have happened but if anyone cared to dig out the misdeamours of IPKF and  New Delhi's change in policy to support the srilankan govt ... It will paint the picture. This is a classic case similar to Palestine struggle, when India could support yaser Arafat miles away, it shunned the neighbour. Wrong policy   , but as Bala singham said, yes it was the biggest blunder by LTTE, even a kid knows that except New Delhi.

                            GOOD LTTE lost. If LLTE had won the war it would have been big trouble for India. India would be in the position of turkey with ISIS breathing down its neck. Post ealem in SRILANKA , the target was to generate TAMIL COUNTRY out of TN. LTTE was a deadly terrorist organization. USA , CHINA realized this and assisted SRILANKAN army.

                            Just of Rs 9000 Crore, this guy will not fled. Also even if he comes back, recovering the cumulative loan of Rs 9000 crore (issued to a Private company) from an individual will be really difficult task for the Banks. <br/><br/>
If Bank could not secure the loan before issuing it, then simply it is Bank's failure. Baaki sab baakwas and sansani.

Tamil were against this and started peaceful protest and you google the atrocities committed by then SL Gov. TAMILS are demand self respect. Will you accept "TAMIL only act" in democratic India.<br/>
Singapore is the best example for people doubt their intentions.

                            And is the 'alliance' and submission to the DMK, which is very sympathetic to and supports Prabhakaran as a Hero even today, also not the 'biggest' mistake of the Congress?
