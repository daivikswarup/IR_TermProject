                                                        The city sessions court rejected the bail plea of Patel quota agitation leader Hardik Patel in a case of alleged sedition, observing that he might repeat the offence.
Additional Sessions judge NG Dave rejected Mr Patel's application filed in January after the Ahmedabad police's filed a chargesheet against him.Upholding the prosecution's argument that Mr Patelmight indulge in similar acts if released, the judge noted that the violent agitation led by him caused a loss of property worth Rs. 40 crore last year.
Mr Patel's lawyer Dinesh Chaudhury said he will file an appeal in the High Court.
Advocate Chaudhury had argued that sedition is a colonial law enacted by the British to suppress the voice of freedom fighters and it had been invoked wrongfully against the Patel leader who was only fighting for his community.
He also said that the police, who had recorded Mr Patel's telephonic conversations, failed to link it with the violence during the agitation.
Mr Patel and three others have been charged with Indian Penal Code sections 124(A) (sedition), 121 (A) (conspiracy to wage war against government) and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy).
They are accused of inciting the violence to mount pressure on the government for accepting the demand of reservations for the Patel community.
