New Delhi:                             It is absurd to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi for everything, Union Minister Jitendra Singh today said while disapproving of Delhi government's way of treating bureaucrats.
He was reacting on the suspension of two officials by Delhi Government, which was later termed as non est by the Centre.In a series of tweets, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had yesterday accused Prime Minister Modi of "firing at the AAP government from the shoulders of Lt Governor" and claimed "DANICS and IAS associations in Delhi have become full-fledged B teams of BJP".
"It is absurd to target the Prime Minister for everything. It is an attempt to gain cheap publicity in the PM's name," Mr Singh told reporters.
The Minister said without allegation or evidence, there is no basis to charge anybody. "In the present time no allegation or charges carry any weightage if it is devoid of any weightage. There is no evidence to prove that (officers as B team of BJP).
"By and large present government has created work friendly atmosphere for bureaucrats. We are committed to give good governance and dedicated to provide work friendly atmosphere. Bureaucracy is essential tool of good governance.
So if you do not create good atmosphere, how would you give the good governance. Anything adverse would necessarily affect the good governance," Mr Singh, Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, said.
He said that so far no representation has been received from IAS officers association or from any DANICS officer working under Delhi government.
To a question on working of the CBI, Mr Singh said the investigating agency was earlier used to work under UPA's control. "But ever since our NDA government has taken over, the CBI has been working independently. Government does not interfere in its working," the Minister said.
He said the government has from today done away with interviews for recruitments to junior level posts.
"The idea is to provide level playing field. It would also give economic benefit to state governments as they will save on the cost of interviews," Mr Singh said.
