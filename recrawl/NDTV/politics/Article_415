Headline::::Team Sri Sri To Deposit Rs. 25 Lakh Today, Rest Within Three Weeks

New Delhi: HighlightsArt of Living deposits Rs. 25 lakhs today
Court gives Art of Living three weeks to pay the balance
5-crore compensation must be paid, green court has saidSri Sri Ravi Shankar's organization has told India's top environmental court that it cannot deposit the five crores ordered by judges before the event begins today on the banks of the River Yamuna in Delhi.  The spiritual leader's Art of Living foundation said it will pay 25 lakhs today and the rest within three weeks.
However, the organizers of the three-day festival which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said they want the five-crore payment to go towards the cost of creating a biodiversity park at the venue, which covers 1,000 acres on the Yamuna's floodplains.
Yesterday, Sri Sri, 59, told NDTV, "We will go to jail but not pay a penny.  We have done nothing wrong."  The court remarked that the comment "is not expected from someone of Sri Sri's stature" while declaring that the five crores will be treated not as a fine but as compensation for damages to the environment.  
 

On Wednesday, the National Green Tribunal berated both the organizers and the government for failing to protect the venue's delicate ecosystem.  The court then asked for five crores with the warning of more to follow, and said a park must be created after the festival ends.
After today, the Art of Living will owe the court 4.75 crores. If it does not pay up, the green tribunal said it will collect part of a 2.5 crore grant that has been sanctioned by the Culture Ministry for the foundation.
"There is no controversy.  Sri Sri is known for resolving controversies," said Home Minister Rajnath Singh.  
Sri Sri has described the event as a "Cultural Olympics" with musical performances on a seven-acre stage, mass meditation sessions and prayers led by Sanskrit scholars.

                            I have lost all the respect I had for Sri Ravishankar and the Art of Living foundation after this. The court has made a judgement and if he wanted he could have appealed it or paid the fine and be done with it. But instead he is disrespecting the court and disobeying the judgement. This is the biggest problem in India, the absence of the rule of law. Hopefully the court will stand its ground and cancel the event.

                            Mumbai, dated 7/12/2017: Mukesh Ambani's daughter Isha's wedding ceremony was celebrated in a grand scale today. The President and the Prime Minister of India, world business leaders, Reliance share holders and other invitees graced the event. It was estimated that a total of about 9 lakh people attended.<br/><br/>
As earlier reported, the ceremony was held on a specially built off-shore structure on the high seas, 7 kilometers form the coast. Apart from ONGC, the Indian army, navy and air-force were commissioned to handle the immense logistical and security challenges.<br/><br/>
Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that with such large number of attendees and the valuable international exposure for the economy, the government will bear all costs related to ONGC and military. He also stated that all patriotic and nationalistic Indians welcome this wholeheartedly, especially since the families of the bride and groom are all Hindus.

                            I just saw - on searching google - a report submitted in 2013 by a 3 member committee to NGT - about absolute need to maintain 53 km. stretch of Yamuna in Delhi &amp; part of Uttar Pradesh and it was clearly recommended in Report that any recreational projects (this MEGA event - cultural program - is of course, recreational activity) proposed by DDA or any body, should not be considered at all on Yamuna River Bank. Art of Living is getting FREE PUBLICITY indirectly but they need to be punished - severely - the highest punishment as per law.

Absolute rubbish. It took this long for AOL to realize that it does not have the money and needs one month to organize it? Complete rubbish. Sri Sri Ravishankar is a politician and BJP is supporting him tacitly. PERIOD.

                            Cancel the event NOW and send out a LOUD AND CLEAR message that no one is above the law. If the NGT shows leniency in this case, it will send out a very wrong signal to others. If a judgment has been passed, it HAS to be implemented, no matter what or who is involved. Make an example of Sri Sri to show who calls the shot. This is the chance. Don't falter or get swayed by the fact that preparations are at an advanced stage and there are foreign performers involved. The law of the land must prevail.

                            The Modi government has a given another reason for the opposition to stall the Parliament and blame the opposition for not passing important bills like GST. The govt must be cautious on such things. Such things make me feel that this govt does not have the experience and wisdom to govern.

                            Before accusing Sri Ravishankar of all the wrong doing, can we try to put ourselves in his shoes and look at this issue? Lets say we have bought a land from a realtor. The land was reclaimed by destroying a lake and the realtor guy somehow got an approval bribing officials. We didn't know all this. We start to build an house on the place getting a loan of 50 lacs and half of the house has been built already. Now another official comes in says the construction is illegal and he takes me to court. Do you think law should prevail and we should give back the land and stop the construction? Should we stop the construction, pay the loan interest and still continue paying rent to the rented house? The court should have intervened before the construction started. The amount of money would have just gone to waste and no money would have been gained to pay for anything.

                            The dignitaries or the leaders who have cancelled should not have done this act of cancellation in the last minute. It does not prove their wisdom as dignitaries or the leaders when Sri Sri &amp; AOL fraternity is holding them in High esteem. It only brings out their weakness not to speak their mind, which shows they are not COMPLETE LEADERS. I feel pained &amp; not sure How Sri Sri is feeling about this.<br/><br/>
As it is said "SAB KA SUNNA DILL KA KARNA"<br/><br/>

It has become commonplace for court orders to be ignored- first by the police last month and now, by these so-called do-gooders. They have hundreds of crores to build huge stages and other infrastructure but no money to pay fines!!

                            Sri Sri is also a human being and definitely made mistake in saying these words.  As a good piece loving person let him offer his apology.  Of course Art of Living has so many avenues of not paying this amount legally by appealing before the Higher court and asking for STAY of the particular words or sentence of the NGT order etc.  I do not know why Sri Sri uttered these words instead he would have chosen to say no comments, or his legal experts will do as per Law etc.

                            Green court should show some respect, any event if there is a fine that will come after conclusion of the event and based on damage. If media report correct then judge talking like politician.

                            Where were you critics when the event organization had started ???<br/>
NDTV and its self absorbed follwers are hell bent on defaming all good that prevails of Bharat.<br/>
Free Speech ofcourse.

                            99.99% of us DO NOT deserve to have opinion on anything. You know how our minds work. On one moment, you catch the thought of environmental destruction and prejudice of memories flow into the mind against Sri Sri. Then after some time some other thoughts enter the mind : you think about Twenty Twenty world cup and centuries. then in another moment , your mind watches a beautiful car, a woman or house. Then the mind suddenly remembers the taste of having a vada pav and goes for it. Understand that our minds are just jumping here and there. Most of us do not have any purpose in life. But we comment freely and then our mind ceaselessly keeps jumping on different things day in an day out. This Sri Sri calls an "uncentered" mind, life living without a purpose...

                            How the fine print is missed out, depends on how things are reported. Possibly, the NGT decision is win-win for all, since the AOL is not paying 'fine' but the compensation for environment; and the NGT getting what it sought from AOL before the event can be allowed.<br/><br/>
Most of the comments always (including mine, most of the times) based on the headline of the report. This is what most of the public is made to form an opinion. The facts are reported but the public opinion made to be biased through headlines.
