New Delhi:Â HighlightsPlea to dismiss action against some Gujarat cops admitted by Top Court
Cops are accused of killing Ishrat Jehan in a fake encounter in 2004
Plea after testimony by David Headley who said Ishrat was a 'LeT bomber'
                                The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a plea seeking dismissal of criminal prosecution, suspension and other actions taken against Gujarat cops in the 2004 alleged fake encounter killing of Ishrat Jehan in view of recent testimony of jailed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative David Headley.
Headley, the Pakistani-American terrorist, had told to a Mumbai court that Jehan was a LeT operative.
"Let it be listed. We will see it then," a bench of Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice UU Lalit said when advocate ML Sharma mentioned the matter for its urgent hearing.Mr Sharma said that the statement of Headley is significant as it conclusively establishes the fact that Jehan was an LeT operative.
Gujarat Police personnel, including the then DIG DG Vanzara, are facing trial in a Mumbai court for their alleged role in the encounter.
The plea, which cited the recent statements before a special court recorded by Headley, who allegedly conspired with LeT in plotting the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, said the facts are now undisputed that all four persons killed by Gujarat Police, including Ishrat Jehan, were terrorists.
"The judicial proceeding and statement of David Headley, who conspired with LeT in plotting the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, stated via video conference and recorded in the special court at Mumbai that four persons, including Ishrat Jehan who were killed in June 2004 by Gujarat Police, were a part of LeT terrorist organisation belonging to Pakistan and they were assigned to kill then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi," it said.
The plea sought a direction to close criminal proceedings and action taken in FIRs lodged by CBI against the Gujarat Police personnel and others, saying it was unconstitutional within the judicial facts and evidences of Headley.
It also sought a direction from the court declaring that killing of a terrorist is not an offence under Indian law and proper compensation be paid to the state police personnel in the interest of justice.
It also wanted initiation of suo motu perjury/contempt proceedings against the then Home Minister and CBI Director for concealing true facts before the Supreme Court and the Gujarat High Court and for filing a false affidavit pertaining to facts about Ishrat Jehan case.

                            P Chidambaram should be punished by Court for change in affidavit by himself and than based on it Gujarat HC ordered for CBI inquiry.<br/><br/>
Else Mr. Pillai (PS of HMO then), Mr. Narayan (then NSA Head), Mr. Ibrahim (IB Head than) all have declared that it was joint intelligence operation by IB &amp; State police. But Mr. Chidambaram changed affidavit for personal gain in politics which took 7 years of police officers in jail...! People who are serving nation remain in jail and their family faced lots of mental stress..! Imagine...this probably happened only in India...<br/><br/>
Mr. Chidambaram should be punished by court in such a way that in future no politician can dare to change such affidavit / facts due to political reason.

                            There should a SIT which should probe the issue of changing the affidavit by the then Home Minister. It should also look into the case denovo, as based on this revised affidavit the courts formed their opinion and jailed Police officials in the Fake Encounter. The issue of implicating Mr Rajendra Kumar of IB and the role of politicians from UPA alleged to have played a role to implicate Mr Rajendra Kumar, in turn  thereby  attempting to implicate Amit Shah and Mr Narendra Modi should also form part of this SIT. Terrorism is a very serious matter concerning the security of the nation. It cannot be a political tool to target political opponents. The recent exposures by Mr GK Pillai is a matter of concern and very serious how the country was being run. We are sure The Honourable Supreme Court will take a correct view and uphold justice. The guilty whoever it may should be punished in a prompt and quick judicial process and truth must come out.
