New Delhi:¬†HighlightsCPI rules out using JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar for poll campaigns
Party wants him to focus on student politics and his case: CPI Sources
Kanhaiya was arrested on sedition charges, is currently out on bail
                                Student leader Kanhaiya Kumar - whose recent arrest on sedition charges had forged a nationwide controversy -- should have a slow initiation into politics, the Communist Party of India or CPI has decided.Mr Kumar -- JNU students' union president who belongs to a group affiliated to the CPI -- was expected to campaign for the Left parties in the coming assembly elections in Bengal and Kerala. There were expectations in some quarters that he would directly dive into electoral politics.But on Monday, the CPI national executive which met in Hyderabad, decided against a straight plunge into active politics for Mr Kumar -- thus ruling out using him directly for election campaigns.
Top sources in the CPI, however, said the party was not going to waste Mr Kumar, who is seen as a promising young leader. "The party will use him as a force multiplier among students across various states," he said.
A leader said Mr Kumar is first expected to visit Bihar, where Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has already hailed him as a rising star.
He will also visit the academic institutions that witnessed student unrest over the last few months - including the Hyderabad university, where the suicide of scholar Rohith Vemula had generated a huge political controversy.
Mr Kumar is also expected to visit IIT Madras, where students have been protesting since last May. A visit to other academic institutions which have witnessed student unrest -- like Pune film institute FTII, Kolkata's Jadhavpur Universiy and the Allahabad university are also on the cards.
"The party wants him to focus on student politics and the legal case that he faces," a leader said.

                            Good to see....30 years old called student..! <br/><br/>
At the age of 28 to 30 - most people have completed first phase of their career and have 5 years to 8 years of experience in their resume.<br/><br/>
This guy is doing his PhD and making his career in politics with public money stipend....! His thoughts on Indian army, India as nation, regarding Kashmir &amp; Afzal Guru are well known and Left want to make him youth icon with help of few media and so called great award wining editors...! God bless the nation...!

                            Let me understand<br/><br/>
If his age is 30 so hypothetically his father age would be 50 years. It's now 67 years since we got Independence, in this 67 years congress ruled for 60 years and still his family is earning 3k per month so let me understand what Azadi he is talking about.

                            Surprisingly none of the politicians are advising this not so young nearly 30 year old student to complete his studies and stand on his own feet and not on subsidised sustenance...

                            1)change the profile picture first since it is CPI decision<br/>
2) It is good that CPI wants to delay since he is a fresh criminal and bench marking for CPI is seasoned criminals<br/>
3) Also it gives opportunity for CPI to distance at a later point of time if charges against him are proved

                            Another Shotgun Sinha of Bollywood fame arising from the stinking dunghill called Bihar.Nitish Kumar will embrace anyone from Bihar as long as it suits his political career. Perhaps D.Raja the CPI leader,typical of his Tamil origins would have seen him as his prospective son-in-law cum political addition to the family.and India pays for such dumb acts.

                            CPI is not strong in Kerala. It is CPI(M) who is the torch bearer. CPI has ideological differences with the Marxists. Only the long hair Panniyan is known outside Kerala. I think this is the first time after the formation of CPI(M) that the CPI was able to stay in news for considerable time. But he is going to fade into oblivion like the rest of the CPI members. He is part of a weak party.

                            Kanhaiya, one career advice. Want to make it large? Join Congress. CPI has no future for you. In congress you will get real chance, but only after RaGa's cartoons are over, and he decides not to put another Gandhi in as a surprise. You can make a good politician for sure, if not a good person.

                            Surely, he has all the qualities of a puppet. He is being played by vested interests. Why does he not quit studies join active politics, become MP MLA and cause more issues than solve them. Instead of going to all these institutions why not work to solve the issues more productively.<br/>
He got his 2 min fame, he is happy all the people supporting him are happy.

                            A PHD student, with great skills and knowledge, being one of the future leader of INDIA, will be very proud of if it happens. There are very less educated people in Politics. With proper guidelines, im sure he would be a very good Leader for INDIA, We the whole world lack Good Leaders, <br/><br/>
Narendra Modi is one among them..

                            He's not smart enough to enter politics. First his research is faulty showing he's not smart enough to do proper research. You open mouth only after mind is on gear with proper research info.

                            He is not campaigning because he knows that even those who want to vote for left will stay away. No one in their right mind supports celebrating Azfal who was responsible for killing many innocents country men during parliament attack. Tears of our army men wife, children and relatives not yet dried. Left knows this too well and hence not interested to bring him to campaign even he wants to. rest is smoke
