New Delhi:Â HighlightsAir India crew had a fight on board their plane
Delhi-Trivandrum flight delayed by several hours
VVIPs on board included parliamentarians, plane stalled on tarmac
                                Air India today gave VVIPS a taste of what the aam passenger confronts all too often.
The national carrier's Delhi-Thiruvanthapuram flight was to take off at 5.45 pm. Passengers boarded the plane on time. But the flight didn't take off -- till 8 pm, the plane was stalled on the tarmac. Not because of technical glitches or urgent last-minute security checks, but because the crew members weren't getting along.
On board were top CPM leader Prakash Karat, three parliamentarians and 16 IAS officers. Despite that, no senior Air India official arrived to get things moving. Â 
One of the parliamentarians, NK Premachandran, told NDTV, "Boarding was over. The flight was ready to take off. Suddenly there was a quarrel between the flight crew members. All the MPs and officials witnessed the flare-up. And due to that, the flight is still standing at the airport". He added, "Neither is the flight taking off, nor are we being allowed to get off."
Â 
The flight was delayed by two hours.
Another angry MP who did not wish to be named said he plans to raise the delay in Parliament.
The two crew members have been suspended by Air India. "No indiscipline will be tolerated," said Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani.

                            Air India is beyond repair. But can we cut the "VVIP" nonsense? The report says, "On board were top CPM leader Prakash Karat, three parliamentarians and 16 IAS officers..." When did these losers (Karat in particular) become VVIP's? Can we please stop using such servile nomenclature?

                            It is a shame for Air India. I think it is time it was dismantled and sold away. It is better not to have a national airline to be ashamed.

                            The vindictive Morarji Desai nationalised this airline which was, previously one of the best in the world.  Well after it was virtually defunct, Praful Patel spent billions of dollars buying aircraft for this airline!  It should have, instead been privatised or liquidated!  It is not too late.  It can still be either liquidated or sold.  Only crew meeting minimum standards should be hired.  All others should be sacked!

                            Air India should be shut down and/or privatized, but not to Vijay Mallaya kind of person. Staff of Air India believes is "What the hell is customer service" ... There logo should be changed from Namaste posing Maharajah to frowning Maharajah saying "Don't You Dare Come"

                            Air India is a good National carrier. Due to few stray incidents, entire AI can't be blamed. Such undisciplined staff members should be shown the door. No mercy against them. They are expected to maintain the decorum and carry their image in front of the travelers what so ever the difference of opinion is prevailing amongst the crew members.

                            Enough is Enough!! How much more of Public Money is going to be infused into this Non-Performing Entity. Since Government is infusing millions of money, there is no worry for these AIR INDIA to perform, as everyone gets Salary &amp; Increments. There is not Performance Based Pay System here. they go by Government Pay Scale.<br/><br/>
Please Close Down this Money Gobbler or Privatize this Airline... But not to people like Mallya

                            Premachandran is a hoisted and dummy parliamentarian who never raised any issue at the parliament.Now he wants to raise Air India Delay in the parliament. What is he ever going to do in Kochi or Trivandrum, if he gets  back on time. <br/><br/>
This kind of delays in Air India and Indian Airlines are notoriously famous for years. This kind of delays and impromptu cancellations of flights are too common in private airlines in India. Air Coasta takes the prime award for this and no one knows how this airline ever got a license to operate.

                            Check with that loser Prakash Karat- he may have been behind the fight in the name of the "People". As for raising it in Parliament, will someone tell that unnamed Parliamentarian that when the MPs themselves behave like spoilt brats. why blame these monthly paid servants. People should have  pride in their work which is not there with these Air India staff.
