New Delhi:¬†HighlightsAttempt to slap student leader Kanhaiya Kumar at JNU campus
Wanted to teach him lesson for anti-India slogans, says outsider
Kanhaiya fined last year for harassing woman student, shows document
                                A man tried to assault student leader Kanhaiya Kumar at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) this evening, claiming he wanted to "teach him a lesson" for "abusing the country, raising anti-India slogans". The man, who is not from the university, was escorted off campus by security.
"The man attacked me amidst all these people. But he was still escorted out of here without any harm," said Mr Kumar to reporters. "An 11 lakh award was offered for my head, I thought 'no problem, India is a poor country," he said, referring to recent posters in Delhi which asked for him to be killed. The man who put them up claims to head an organization called the "Purvanchal Sena" and has been arrested.
Last month, the arrest of Mr Kumar on sedition charges catapulted the government into an enormous controversy with accusations that is trying to crush dissent and free speech at colleges. Mr Kumar, who heads a Left students union, was granted bail and delivered an impassioned speech upon his return to campus with rave reviews for his oratory skills.He has denied that he made anti-India remarks at an earlier event on campus, but says he will fight what he describes as the divisive policies of the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Kanhaiya Kumar, arrested on charges of sedition, was released on bail earlier this month.
Mr Kumar today also occupied another major controversy with the emergence of a university document that shows he was fined last year for misbehaving and threatening a woman student. Describing his act as "serious in nature and unbecoming of a student of JNU", university officials fined him Rs. 3,000.
The university has confirmed the letter's authenticity, claims news agency Press Trust of India. "I am shocked to see how a misogynist like Kanhaiya is being hailed as revolutionary," the woman who he harassed was reported as saying.
"We do respect the girl's right to criticise Kanhaiya but we want to reiterate that he has always stood for gender justice," said a statement from the union that is headed by Mr Kumar.

I know there is one reporter always behind Kanhaiya because NDTV can offord it for making India more Secular, is the reporter following up with Kanhaiya is also wounded or is he OK?

Isn't it even worse on Union's part? They made an offender their president. Probably he harasses women and men equally and hence this union believed that he stood for gender equality.

                            Kanhaiya never presented himself as a prophet but as a Student leader who is recognized by majority of JNU students and now majority of Indian youth. He is entitle to make mistakes like past student leaders like Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Mamata Banerji, Arun Jaitley, Sitaram Yachuri, Venkaiya Naidu, Jyoti Basu, Shashi Tharoor, Shekhar Gupta and many more. Are Mohan and Modi, though never were Student leader, always behaved like a spotless prophet?

                            at this point whether he is right or wrong ,  each attempt to castrate kanhiya will only grow his stature . And he can easily milk this in the deeply casteist Bihar. <br/><br/>
If I were a BJP strategist I would just leave him alone . Also I talked to a lot of SC students and whatever gains BJP made among the community in 2014 have not only been lost but further damaged after vemula and kanhiya twin episodes <br/><br/>
also ask your "fringe" to just shut up

                            Everybody wants to bask in his popularity handed over to him, whatever the real lesson here is that partial media could be dangerous, it was media who implicated him for false sloganeering for which he's getting abused and it was media too who made him a hero without checking his background, hence media and all these outlets aren't exempted from criticism and its partially a culprit in whatever is happening...

                            Modi-Shah should stop playing with the aware and fed up section of society. This is like dried wood. Stop doing experiments started by Congress in 1984 and then carried on by BJP.<br/>
The country is at stake.

                            This media channel should move to Paki ISI HQ very soon and live on grants. The enemy is within reach after being exposed by their own actions. This commie channel should be boycotted by all corporates... they will shut down as they are already in the red.

                            For whole life he will be attacked, as people of the country are not NDTV journalists, and they are too angry on this nonsense freedom of speech. Any fool in this world won't allow such indiscipline. Knhaiya is lucky that he is in India.

                            Wan wan, he was not the president of the JNU Union when he intimidated and assisted a fellow woman student, so he should not be demonised! What an analogy ? Ms Burkha Dutt , you told us that you saw a glitter in his eyes which showed his passion that he wanted Azadi within India ! Imagine what this guy can do to women being a leader that you project him to be !

                            Now who arranged this attack? <br/>
Kongi/ FekJP/ Lefti/ just an attaker?? whoever they are.. <br/>
KK is pawn in the game.. the sooner he realises it, it better for him before the attack becomes life-threatning.. God bless and Good Luck
