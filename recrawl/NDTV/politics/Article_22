Raipur:                             
	Employees of the Chhattisgarh government will now be able to attend 'shakhas' of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) with the ruling BJP lifting the ban on their participation in 'non-political activities' of the Sangh Parivar.
	The opposition Congress has dubbed the move as "harmful to democratic process".
	The state government has revoked the ban, which was imposed during undivided Madhya Pradesh, barring government employees from participating in RSS's activities, Special Secretary, General Administration Department, DD Singh told PTI.
	The order in this connection was issued by the department last week, he said.The order, issued in undivided Madhya Pradesh, specified that participating in RSS activities or functions by government employees would be a violation of the Civil Services rules, Mr Singh said.
	In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, also ruled by BJP, the ban was lifted a few years back, but was still in place in Chhattisgarh, and has been removed now, he said.
	However, he said the ban on participating in political activities is still in force.
	The opposition Congress has protested against the move saying it will harm the democratic system of the country.
	"The move will dilute the difference between government and a political party. RSS has been claiming to be a social-service apolitical outfit but everyone is well aware of the fact that they are running the BJP from backdoor. Hence, association of government employees with such organisation will harm the democratic process," said TS Singhdeo, Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly.

                            Shakhas sounds like a community evacuation under the Khaki. BJP/RSS/VHP think that they can enforce their ideology quickly because time is running out on them. The public is watching these antics!

                            Right move. When you being a Govt muslim servant can go to the mosque and support kashmiri separatist and same way a Govt Hindu servant can go to temple. Why they can not attend RSS. It is not a banned organisation. Owashis can be MLA and PMs. Why can not a Hindus go to RSS.

                            This is a good move, RSS is nationalist organization of India. There are BJP supporters in RSS but not all RSS workers are BJP supporters. Shankar Singh vaghela of gujarat is one of the example. I remember my childhood days when my parents used to bar me from participating in RSS activities because of my fathers govt job.

                            Well done Raman singh. It is a good step and  I am sure Chattisgarh will develop a lot.<br/><br/>
I request all the people who do no know about RSS to visit the shakhas in the morning and physically see what is done by the swayamsevaks.<br/>
In the shakhas we pray Bharat mata, Read one subhashitam, sing one patriotic song, discuss about medical camps, Tell one patriotic story of Freedoms fighters. That is all sir.
