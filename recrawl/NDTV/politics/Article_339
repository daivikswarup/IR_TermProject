                            today it is Mr. Ravi Shankar tomorrow it will Ramdev.<br/>
Indian Army for Private Event? unheard of in Indian History.<br/>
Is it not Tax Payers Money being involved? why Not a single Khaki Chaddi is shouting now?<br/>
why this favoritism? why not the same at Pragati Maidan? or for that matter in Delhi Stadium by paying the requisite fee to Delhi Cricket Board where this is crunch of funds which were looted and Kiriti Azad is fighting for justice.<br/>
Shameful, destroying the natural beauty and abode of so many Animals? are they different from Cows?

                            Unfortunately the media in India is worst than that of anywhere in the world.

                            300 of the 360 degrees shown in this photo is just a road and some cars. Why don't you just show a regular photo? What are you trying to prove?

                            I think that it would be very inappropriate for the PM to attend such an event regardless , of whether  damage to the environment has been done or not. The president has done the right thing by distancing himself from this ill advised carnival on the banks of the Yamuna.Certainly the organisers had no business to put up pictures of the PM and President.  Haven't  insane jokers like Sakshi Maharaj, "educationists"  with dubious qualifications like Dinanath Batra , and controversial yoga gurus like Baba Ramdev done enough damage to the credibility of the BJP? Do they want to add to the list with Sri Sri? Why is the BJP having such a death wish? Modi can really do great things if only he sheds these millstones around his neck. If he doesn't give these trouble makers the boot he will definitely lose the next election.
