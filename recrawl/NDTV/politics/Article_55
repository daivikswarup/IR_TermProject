New Delhi:                             Government today said the concept of marital rape cannot be "suitably applied in the Indian context" due to factors like poverty, illiteracy and religious beliefs.
"It is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors like level of education/ illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament etc," Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.She was asked whether government plans to criminalise marital rape.
This is not the first time that an NDA minister has made a remark on marital rape.
Last year, Minister of State for Home, Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary made similar remark when he said that, "the concept of marital rape does not apply in India as marriage is treated as sacred here."
Mr Chaudhary, in a reply to DMK's K Kanimozhi, said: "It is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including level of education, illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat marriage as a sacrament."

                            Maneka Ji, please press the government to make necessary changes in  section 498A and Domestic Violence (DV)act. We are not appealing to scrap these laws....we just want it made unbiased.

                            Thanks Maneka Ji.....we salute and we are proud of you. You are probably the first women and child development minister of India who thought of the male rights. Had marital rape been enacted it must have been misused against men.

                            Yes, protecting the custom of ignorance is more important in India than protecting a housewife being beaten to pulp by a husband because he thinks he has the ultimate right over his wife for next seven births.
