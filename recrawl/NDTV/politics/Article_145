Lucknow:Â                             Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan today charged BJP-led central government with meting out "step motherly treatment" to Uttar Pradesh, alleging that the state was not provided with funds meant for different schemes.
"You won the election in the name of Ganga and it is your duty to give funds for its cleaning...not a single paisa has been given to the state and this reality should come before the people," Mr Khan said in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.
"Grant for the Jal Nigam has not been given following which its staff has not got salaries," he said, alleging that the people of the state have been cheated.
The Parliamentary Affairs Minister said the BJP has already accepted it will not win the upcoming UP Assembly polls after tasting defeat in Delhi and Bihar, and thus not a single smart city project was allotted to the state.
"They (BJP) have thrown their hands up even before the fight. How can a soldier who has accepted defeat fight the war," Mr Khan asked.
Contesting the minister's claims, BJP leader Satish Mahana said the state did not send the required proposal for the smart city project.
He also asked as to why the ruling SP, which had nothing to do either with Delhi or Bihar, was happy with BJP's showing in the states.
Mr Khan, however, claimed the state was the first to send a smart city proposal to the Centre.
