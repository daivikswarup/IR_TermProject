New Delhi:                             Home Minister Rajnath Singh today reviewed the internal security situation in the country in the wake of inputs that 10 suspected Lashkar- e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists have entered India from Pakistan through Gujarat.
At a high-level meeting, attended by top security officials including Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi and Director of Intelligence Bureau Dineshwar Sharma, Mr Singh took stock of the situation and the steps taken to prevent any possible terror attacks. The Home Minister was briefed that four National Security Guards (NSG) teams have taken position in different locations in Gujarat and would rush to any place if there is any emergency, official sources said.
Mr Singh also reviewed the steps taken to beef up security in strategic locations, religious sites and industrial spots in Gujarat and metro cities apprehending threats, they said.
However, so far there is no clue about the suspected terrorists, who were believed to have entered Gujarat, which could be their prime target.
An alert has already been sounded in Gujarat and other major metropolitan centres by central security agencies following reports that the 10 terrorists have entered the western state to carry out attacks against high-value targets.
A similar alert has also been sent to Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chandigarh.
In view of the January 2 terror attack in Pathankot airbase, security agencies were not taking any chances and all possible steps are being taken to prevent any possible terror attacks, sources said.

                            So Rajnath spent a few hours on Twitter and read a lot of tweets from fake accounts? That would be a lot of help!
