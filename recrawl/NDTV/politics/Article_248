New Delhi:Â                             PM Modi is replying in Parliament on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address at the start of the Budget session.Here are the highlightsIn President's Address, one thing that was said that has a positive effect on everyone. He said that House should function and we should have a debate. All of us have considered his advice seriously and the House in running smoothly. I want to thank all members for itQuestion Hour is an asset of the members. This is their way of cornering the government and making the executive accountable. Ministers too are kept on their toesLast time 169 starred questions, but only 7 got chance. We have lost 42 hours due to disruptions in HouseIn the session before that, of 270 starred questions, only 6 were discussed and we lost 72 hours.To give answers to members, minister have had to work late at nightDeath has never been be defamed, no allegations have been made on death. Someone dies due to cancer, blame is on cancer. It seems Congress has a similar boon. If we criticise Congress, media says Opposition attacked, it never says Congress attacked. If we say against Sharad Ji and Maya ji, papers will report attack on BSP, JD(U). Congress never gets defamedIt's true that regimes, governments have changed over the time. Now we are in power.It's important to push for a quantum jump in governance. Transparency is the cornerstone of 'Good Governance'Earlier the country was plagued with nepotism and corruptionDemocracy runs on effective policies, not the will of a lone entityMany of our projects worth 15 lakh crore were stalled. But I'm pleased to announce to the house all of those projects are now operationalGovernment has emphasised on decentralization. Earlier these projects were forwarded to Delhi, and we all know what used to happen, they used to get stalled in some way or the otherWe established 10 regional offices to handle these projects. We have given states more rights to handle matters pertaining to environment clearancesGood governance also relies on effective delivery. Lots of talk in the Oppn about Jan Dhan scheme.I'm grateful to Ghulam Nabi for highlighting problems with Jan Dhan in Bhopal. He compiled list of people who haven't got a Jan Dhan account yetYou used a microscope and picked apart faults in Jan Dhan scheme. Had you used a binocular and critiqued your own initiatives while you were in power then it'd have been betterIt's true that regimes, governments have changed over the time.

Had you used a binocular and critiqued your own initiatives while you were in power then it'd have been betterSubsidy worth crores will be saved by targeted subsidy program in Chandigarh. This is not about saving a few rupeesIt's about getting rid of unofficial middlemen, and giving benefits straight to the peopleTwo types of people are there in the world: Those who work and those who take credit for the work that's doneIn 2008, Skill Development program also fostered a great skill: Making committees after committeesIn 2013 it was decided that National Skill Development Agency be made and all the other committees be shut downThe problem with you was that you knew how to do but you lacked the will to do anythingWe must emphasise on apprenticeship programme, youth want to work but are shown the door when they have no experience to show for itWhy can't we all get together and decide that by 2022 we will double the income of our farmersI'm not an economist like Manmohan Singh, don't have his immense intellectBut I'm from a humble upbringing, have witnessed hardships of povertyQuotes from MS Swaminathan latest article, "Seeds have been sown for agriculture transformation and for attracting and retaining youth in farming. The dawn of a new era in farming is in sight."Can farmer incomes be doubled by 2022? If we make sure that soil health cards are used effectively then yes it's a real possibility

                            Transparency is the cornerstone. Yes correct. So tell the people who doctored the videos about the jnu students. Be transparent about one issue at least. Every stupid decision taken by your government is against the common man and the is nothing transparent about then either. Swach bharat cess,  krishi kalyan cess etc to name a few

                            Given the kind of road blocking, what the Government is managing in terms of policy and governance initiatives is really admirable. This year's budget is also a welcome shift in vision, while retaining focus on priorities. The Congress is still smarting from its loss is apparent by the kind of issues they keep raking up, whether JNU, intolerance or some statement by some Hindutva radical. For writing this I will be branded sanghi, another cheap offensive (pun intended) by the so called secular liberals. Koi gaal nahi, burnol laga lo

                            @raja iyer...you should understand what's like going down the drain ...had it still been the corrupt congress you could have tested that also. Should have faith in someone working so hard for the country to bring it to glory ...can't the congress..pseudo seculars and leftist and the ngos let him work for 5 years ... are they so afraid about there existence that they have started to interrupt every step of him that's being taken in the interest of our country.

                            Modi was CM of Gujarat for 12+ years and the Gujarat Metro project was started on March 2004 and still not yet even completed 1 km. Can you please answer this Modi?

                            @Raja Iyer: Have the basic quality to look at things on merit. It doesn't matter whether a good thing is done by A or B as long as it's done. People like you just jump the gun and are ready with your fingers to type negatives with a preset notion. People like you are always a pain for any nation, but fortunately, that's always a minority and countries survive and grow despite elements like you.<br/>
