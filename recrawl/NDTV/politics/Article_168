New Delhi:                             India has asked Pakistan to inform it at least five days in advance about the visit by its Joint Investigation Team (JIT) in connection with the Pathankot terror attack, official sources said.
Pakistan has formed a five-member Joint Investigation Team to probe the Pathankot terror attack and it is expected to arrive in the country soon.On Wednesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz had said the team may visit India in the next few days.
Earlier, a six-member Special Investigation Team was set up by the Pakistan government for conducting an initial probe into the January 2 attack based on the leads given by India.
India had said Masood Azhar, head of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, masterminded the attack and sought action against him and other perpetrators.
Last month, Pakistan had lodged an FIR in the Pathankot terror attack case which was seen by India as a "step forward" in bringing the perpetrators of the strike to justice.
The FIR was filed against "unknown persons" though India had named Masood Azhar as the mastermind of the strike. India had submitted evidence to show that the six perpetrators who attacked the air base came from across the border.
Meanwhile, asked if there could be a meeting between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz on the sidelines of SAARC foreign ministers meeting in Kathmandu in mid-March, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup said "as of now, I have no such information and there is no schedule so far."

                            I can understand. India needs 5 days to create fake evidence whilst concealing the genuine ones.
