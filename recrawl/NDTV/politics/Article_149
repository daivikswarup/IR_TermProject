New Delhi:Â                             After a three hour long meeting of its Central Election Committee (CEC), the BJP announced the names of 88 candidates for the Assam Assembly polls this evening. It also declared its first list for West Bengal.
Union Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, party's Chief Ministerial candidate, will contest from Majuli - a reserved seat for tribals - one of the world's largest river islands and the seat of a powerful Vaishanavite monastery.
