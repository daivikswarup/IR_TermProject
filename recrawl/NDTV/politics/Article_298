Srinagar:                             Soldiers working to rescue the thousands of people who still remain stranded in Srinagar have been asked to remain "very calm" if they are pelted with stones by angry crowds, a senior army officer told NDTV today."Our assessment is that crowds are being provoked," said Lieutenant General Subrata Saha, General Officer Commanding the 15 Corps.  " Incidents of stone-pelting are a hindrance  to our rescue and relief operations and are denying people their right to be rescued," he said, while stressing,  "I have instructed my men to be very calm if incidents of stone pelting take place."The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been ravaged by the worst floods in over a century. The army, air force and navy have engineered a massive operation that has so far brought more than one lakh people to safety. (Here is How You Can Help)But recently, army trucks have been attacked with stones as they tried to deliver supplies in Srinagar; the air force yesterday said it was scaling back on its winching  operations- roping up stranded people into helicopters - after threats of stones being hurled.  (Also Read: Air Force Scales Back Rescue Ops)In Srinagar, where the River Jhelum burst into the streets after becoming swollen with unusually heavy rain, anger among the people is simmering over what they describe as the detachment of the state government, which they say has failed to provide any assistance in the crisis. Speaking to NDTV, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said he is not interested in "a credit game." He also said, "I had no government", pointing out that several of his top ministers were stranded in the floods and it was impossible to contact them because phone networks had been knocked out. ('I Had No Government', Omar Abdullah Tells NDTV)The chief minister also said that the stones are being  thrown not by frustrated residents -whose anger is understandable, he said - but by "disruptive elements" seeking "to fish in troubled waters"

                            Why........nd where are the bludy Gilanis &amp; Yaseen Maliks etc who were shouting everyday. Why are they not helping their people from floods. Are they enjoying parties with hafeez in pakisstan where they have escaped floods. And what about Mufti and his daughter and PDP. Have they all ran away from JK. It is the army and centre which has been doing all relief work. Its time people of kashmir realise this and this is the best oppertunity.

                            Why are the defence forces being called in for every calamity? The state governments don't even bother to be self sufficient just because the defence would come and rescue. That too in a state where the locals insist upon savagery.As a person belonging to a defence family I clearly understand the pain our forces undergo to rescue such ungrateful people. Let the separatists rescue them. Where the hell are they now? Their wagging tongues seem silent when it comes to welfare of Kashmiris

                            The gall of some of these Kashmiri guys to pelt stones at the Indian army!! Why dont they ask their Hurriyat leaders and Pakistan handlers to come and rescue them. It is as if they feel India is obliged to rescue them so that they can continue their anti-national activties. Disgusting

                            The soldiers are helping people to evacuate them from troubled area.Those idiots who throw stones for helping them and disturbing soldiers who are unarmed and might get dangerously hurt during their live saving operation should not stay calm.It again terrorist supporters living all over J &amp; K area including Srinagar need to be shot down without any hesitation. Why our soldiers should suffer in the area where they are trying to save lives of thousands victimized in worst flood.It is total wrong decision of Army General asking our soldiers to remain calm against stone throwing stupid people who dont respect our soldiers trying to help them.No need to help such idiots and it is best to let them die rather than saving them who are hindrance to evacuation operation.

                            if Army retaliates , all separatist and secessionist would be successful in their design of provoking forces, Its good so much media is present to stop any rumour otherwise these would go to any extent of spreading rumour . Its a good design to allow media for free reporting. Well thought of media management by Modi. Identify such people and expose them in front of public , at least they should know who cares for them

                            This is an another glaring example of greatness of Indian forces engaged in rescue work in Kashmir.They have been asked to remain calm even if attacked by miscreants.it implies,soldiers while on duty will not get provoked if attacked by miscreants but will continue with their work of evacuation and delivering supplies to stranded people. Chief Minister has said that these are the people who want to fish in troubled water. Miscreants in Kashmir have always been acting on orders of their masters across the border.Pakistan's propaganda machinery has been completely put out of function on seeing tremendous work being done by Indian forces to save lives of Kashmiri people. Islamabad is unnerved,disturbed and totally frustrated.Its anti-India mechanism was dislodged by Kashmiri people themselves when Pak sponsored tribals had raided Kashmir. Again in 1965, It was a group of Kashmiri Gujjars in uphill areas of the Valley who were the first to inform Indian authorities about infiltration of intruders from Pakistan into India...Now,at this time, City of Srinagar is full of stories of bravery,courage and sacrifices of Indian Army men and Air Force..People of Kashmir shall remain indebted to Indian soldiers for their heroic deeds,for ever...and ever.

                            Let these people die if they continue to attack our soldiers. If we kill then it is murder. If nature does then it is calamity.

                            @kumar, I know what the defence forces does. my husband leaves the house each day for such things being posted in J and K, we also understand very clearly about the attitude of the state and local governments regarding the defence forces. also why do we have the state police. ndrf and other organizations when the defence does everything?? are they just for a roll call? to eat into the tax payers money? I live in J and K, I see things first hand in this state.

                            The stone pelters should be and must be treated strictly. Why should anyone pelt stone at Indian Army personnel who are working so hard to save lives of Indians. Anyone pelting stone is a criminal and must be punished.

                            My sincere opinion is once this episode of evacuation/ assistance of providing the foods/clothing etc.. through army is over, ALL the jawans/ personnel s who worked the entire battalion should be awarded suitably for their service done. Also , the defense personnel s income should be increased above the regular central staff with good incentives. I am aware that at present they do have a bit above the regular government staff , am asking the Government to consider for more their selfless services.

                            The Military has proved their might in the rescue and rehabilitation process also - where the local administration had totally failed. Even the separatists and critics of Army had to seek their help to get saved from the nature's fury. Their pay roll master the ISI could do nothing against the nature's fury.It is time the people of Kashmir understood that and separatists are shown the place they belong to. It is time the people of Kashmir recognised the sacrifices of the military even risking own life many often. It is also time the people aligned with the main stream politics and shown the door to the Abdulla and Mehbooba dynasties. Kashmir Legislature has already violated the Constitutional provision as to foreign policy by taking a different stand from the centre as to talks with the rogue nation Pakistan. Therefore, Art 370 has no significance now and Kashmir should be fully aligned with the Indian union with safe guarding provisions only to protect its beauty.

                            Immediate task before the State administration is to rehabilitate thousands and thousands of people displaced by devastating floods. Houses located on banks of the river have mostly become unliveable because they remained submerged in water for days together,rendering their foundations,supporting pillars and walls weak..A massive survey will have to be taken before these are declared fit for living.There is an acute shortage of food supplies and essential commodities..In fact,administration will have to reach out to almost every family for providing help in food and essential commodities,.Availability of medicines in hospitals has reached near zero supply. Drinking water resources are to be restored immediately,as pure drinking water is in a short supply,terribly. Over and above all this and the most important,administration shall have to move swiftly to prevent outbreak of epidemic.A huge task force of sanitation workers will have to be mobilised for this work..A total rehabilitation and reconstruction will have to be taken to restore normalcy in the city as well as in other parts of the Valley...However,with will power,confidence and determination ,people of Kashmir will be able to accomplish it quickly...
