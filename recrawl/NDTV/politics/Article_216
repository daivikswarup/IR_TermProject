New Delhi: HighlightsPM's security team assesses Sri Sri event in Delhi as unsafe zone
SPG team that carried out security assessment says area too large & open
Art of Living event to be held on the flood plains of the river Yamuna
                                The Art of Living cultural event by the Yamuna river in Delhi has run into more rough weather. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on the list of invitees for the event but the assessment of the Special Protection Group or SPG that is responsible for his security has said area is not secure enough for him to be there.
The SPG always carries out a security assessment of a venue the prime minister is to visit. In the second phase the elite force secures the area and works with local police and agencies to provide a shield to the Prime Minister.Delhi's top security and intelligence agencies have been battling a huge security concern from the time they were informed that both the President and Prime Minister are on the list of invitees of the World Cultural Festival being organised by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's Art of Living.
A top security official said, "When President Pranab Mukherjee sent out a polite no to attending the event, the security matrix was partially relieved."
Another official explained, "The scale of the event is like the Republic Day Parade. But, the Rajpath lawns (the parade venue) are sanitised long before January 26 are taken over by the army. This can't happen here." The venue for the event is the flood plains of the Yamuna, bordering Uttar Pradesh.
The SPG team that carried out the security assessment feels that the area is too large and open. The force feels the venue is unsuitable for controlled access. The force has been on a high alert since the Pathankot Airbase attack in January. Recent intelligence reports that terrorists from Pakistan have infiltrated India looking to strike big have only compounded the SPG's worries. If Mr Modi does attend the event, it will need a vast security cover, officials say.
The country's top environment court will decide today on whether to allow the event to take place after allegations that it will cause irreparable damage to the river bed.

                            This event is planned to bring peace and cultures together by singing, dancing and meditation by masses. These kinds of events should be highly encouraged by media rather than only focusing on negative or fearful news. We had enough of Dadri and Kaliachak riots, enough of JNU. Time is spread peace and positive news.

                            Dear Friends<br/><br/>
Sri Sri is a con artist of the first order. They use immense pressure on volunteers. everyone is brainwashed, thy have targets to recruit more and for donation and to ensure every one does his Kriya Yoga. He makes money handover fist with his ruthless sister. Both this fellow and the Isha Yogi chap are real scammers. They live an opulent life. Shame of the so called sheep followers.

                            the deployment of army was justified as security needed.....but it was never so....it was wastage of country's resources for private event......<br/><br/>

                            Everybody who are crying foul on this event, and betting their emotions on NGT-environment, permanent damage to Yamuna, where they were when IP Thermal station, Yamuna bank metro station,CWG village and hundreds of metro pillars were built foreever on the banks of Yamuna ? What irreversible damage can a 3 day event can make ?

                            All that army and Modi does feel safe? Or has Modi realised that once again, he's put his foot in it? Case of foot and mouth disease more likely than security issues. Bunch of clowns! They can never get it right.

I am flying from north america Only for this event. I am hoping top environment court definitely does not want me sit in front of it for 3 days instead of attending the festival

                            was there a need to put the words not so safe within commas? ...is media there to serve the news or steer public opinion? ...ndtv in particular have been cleverly serving the news with innuendos to form its readers opinion....let the reader decide sir, not YOU
