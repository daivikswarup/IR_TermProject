Nagaur: HighlightsThree-day RSS meeting will discuss key challenges that the BJP's ideological mentor says are facing the country. 
                                Top bosses of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS begin a three-day meeting in the Rajasthan town of Nagaur today to discuss key challenges that the BJP's ideological mentor says are facing the country. The meeting is being most watched, however, to see if a change in uniform will be announced.
The RSS will assess proposals that its famous khaki flared knee-length shorts should give way to full length trousers in blue or grey.
"Several proposals have come up for change in Ganvesh (uniform) and this will be discussed in the meeting...This will be about replacing knickers with full pants. Several proposals regarding its colour are also there but the colour will not be khakhi," senior RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya said on Thursday.
He said that the issue was debated in 2010 but there was no consensus and so it was deferred for five years. Discussion resumed last year, he added.
 
Amit Shah arrived in Nagaur on Thursday
Mr Vaidya said the meeting in Nagaur, between Jodhpur and Bikaner and over 250 km from state capital Jaipur, will be attended by RSS workers and leaders from all over the country.
Also attending are leaders of organisations affiliated to the RSS, including the BJP, whose president Amit Shah arrived in Nagaur on Thursday.
 
Among issues listed for discussion at the meeting are affordable healthcare and education.
The Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the highest decision making body of what is called the Sangh parivar or family, meets every year in March.
The RSS's khaki shorts have defined its cadres for over nine decades. But many senior members have reportedly suggested that a new uniform could attract more young people.
The RSS, set up in 1925, describes itself as the world's largest voluntary organization with six million members.

                            This is definitely the most interesting news in the history of India. Nothing can be bigger than deciding the color of pants of the largest gay organisation in the world. Great job!

                            RSS is the reason that India is not being ruled by Sharia law otherwise parties like Congress and Left would have long consumed the Constitution to replace it with Sharia Law. Communals won't like this but that's the fact. Period.

                            Happy to see  where their priorities lie. There are no other pressing concerns in the country. Wow!  What a bunch of morons.  I think their new uniforms should be saris. It's supposed to make you look slim so it's perfect. These guys are such a pathetic bunch and they r supposed to be  in charge of the preservation of all things Hindu? Boy are we in trouble.  Actually maybe this ll keep them occupied and out of our collective lives for a while.

                            Why dont they just change it to jackboots and swastikas and stop pretending they are anything but a bunch of nazi-worshipping thugs salivating for varna supremacy and subjugation of everybody who doesnt subscribe to their medieval worldview. They are so alike the islamo-fascists that they claim to despise, it would be comical if not for the fact that they are deadly serious about their delusions of grandeur.

                            The major challenge is how to tackle growing anti-nationals in the country and the change of dress will be bottom of the agenda if they find time.
