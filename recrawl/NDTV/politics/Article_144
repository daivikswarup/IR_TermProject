New Delhi:Â                             Hitting out at Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan for his "PM met Dawood" claim, BJP today asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to either prove his Cabinet colleague's charges or apologise for the "baseless remark".
BJP also targeted Mr Khan over the Muzaffarnagar riots and slammed him for "touching new low in his practice of vote bank politics", saying his remarks are a "desperate attempt to hide the failures of Akhilesh government and divide people".
"Azam Khan should either prove his charges or Akhilesh Yadav should apologise for levelling such malicious and baseless charges against the PM," BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma said.
"Muzaffarnagar riots are Azam Khan's creation. It was under his pressure that UP police failed to act against molesters in Muzaffarnagar. This inaction sowed the seeds of riots which took a communal colour."
"All probes have highlighted Azam Khan's role in Muzaffarnagar riots. His latest remarks make up yet another attempt to divide the society for appeasement and vote bank politics, and to cover up for Akhilesh government's governance failures in UP," Mr Sharma said.
Training the guns on Mr Yadav, the BJP leader said despite his young age and engineering education, the UP Chief Minister has been "unable to break free from the appeasement brand of his father Mulayam Singh and fundamentalist Azam Khan".
"Akhilesh Yadav's performance as UP Chief Minister has been disappointing. His image is in tatters.
"His cabinet colleague's false charges against the PM are a means of deflecting attention from SP's failings, and attempts to polarise people as UP elections draw closer," Mr Sharma said.
BJP alleged that all UP leaders be it Mayawati, Mulayam Singh or those from Congress have ruined the state and are now trying to create an atmosphere of negativity and hurdles in the path of PM Modi.
"UP citizens don't have to access to even basic power, water, health and education facilities. Law and order situation is deteriorating with each passing day.
"The state is being run by Azam Khan which is why its crime graph is rising. Akhilesh Yadav has no control left over the UP administration nor can he rein in Azam Khan, known for his controversial remarks," Mr Sharma said.
Government had yesterday rubbished as "false and baseless" the allegation of Mr Khan, who plumbed new depths to claim that the Prime Minister had met underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Lahore at the residence of his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif during his Christmas Day visit.

                            Who would take Azam Khan seriously? Only Akilesh because of the much vaunted vote bank politics. He is more at home with his buffaloes than humans. So leave him to bellow there.

                            I am sure he is right because Azam khan is in touch with dawood and dawood asked to Aazam khan before attending the party
