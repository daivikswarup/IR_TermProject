Headline::::Democracy And Freedom Of Expression Are 'Jokes': Director Karan Johar



DateTime::::2016-01-22T17:17:43+05:30



Mumbai:                             Freedom of expression is "the biggest joke", said Karan Johar, one of Bollywood's most successful film directors, at the Jaipur Literature Festival.  
"How are we democratic?  How is there freedom of expression?" he asked, stating "Everywhere I go, I am scared, I am scared I am saying something in Jaipur, and God knows who'll file a case when I reach home. So I have become some kind of an FIR king now."
He also referred to the country's archaic laws which criminialize homosexuality.  Reminding his audience that he has never openly said he is gay - "I have not yet revealed (that)," he said in Jaipur  -  he stated,   "Revealing in today's time will land you in jail...we're in a tough country to speak about your personal life."With his comments, Mr Johar, 43, will be seen as having joined a small group of Bollywood heavyweights who have expressed their concern about moral policing and an atmosphere of increasing intolerance in India. The government has rejected those charges made by some intellectuals, writers and artists.
Late last year, top actors Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan faced a furious online backlash after they said that they are concerned about a growing "cultural and religious intolerance".  A barrage of invective on Twitter summarized them as anti-nationalist.
Aamir Khan, 50, spoke in November about a sense of "insecurity" and "fear" spreading in the country and revealed that his wife had questioned whether the couple should leave the country with their young son.  
A few week before that,  Shah Rukh Khan referred to "extreme intolerance in India" after the lynching of a Muslim man in  Dadri in Haryana over incorrect reports that he had beef in his home.

                            No need to scare. Just give a proper thought before you say something. It should not hurt anyone's feeling. That's it..

                            These jokers from Bollywood have done enough &amp; more damage to our country's "culture &amp; unity". Please IGNORE and black out statements from these professionals, wherein everything  is "Illusion" only. Bollywood may be a commercially important client for medias, more for electronic medias. But, some timesyou people  have to do little "service" to the nation also !!!

                            When you are in public life and enjoying perks, there are certain responsibilities attached to it. People who have fans all over the country can influence their audience and hence should restrict themselves while expressing their views. <br/><br/>
You people are leaders in your own field and should not create negative perception of our great Country.

                            people disagreeing with you is not intolerance. they filing a case against you is them exercising their freedom of expression. couldn't the organizers find somebody better than the director of "student of the year" to speak at India's premier literary festival?

                            if you wish to know what intolerance against Muslims than got to ANY MIDDLE-EASTERN Country like Saudi Arabia or Iran or any western country like the United States.

                            With freedom of Speech and expression comes great responsibility and not Bakwas. Otherwise move to any middle eastern country if you want to see what anti-muslim looks like in the current world.

                            Karan Johar seems to have different definition of democracy and freedom The fact that democracy is rule of law and Johar can not breach them is expressed by his fear that he has done breached a rule and that is why he apprehends some or other FIR against him. Such illiterate actors are sahme. Freedom of speech does not mean he can do everything--which he does is few reality shows That time he does not fear freedom of speech

                            This is called in Hindi as," Bahati Ganga Mein Haath Dho Lena." Any Tom Dick and Aamir Or Karan utters a few words like Intolerance, Freedom Of Expression, Disastrous Situation, Curb on speech...blah blah... and gets his 2 minutes of " INTELLECTUAL" fame. No qualification or authority on the subject is required. Only condition is that it should indirectly blame BJP &amp; yippee you are "Intellectual"!!!

                            Karan Only your opinion is secular and democratic intelligent and well thought through !  The joy of India is that even I have a right to think that my ideas are just as secular democratic intelligent and well thought through. If someone has put an FIR against what you have said - well thank god that it is a democratic country that allows them to do so !!  Otherwise you would be living in Saudi. So far the public has been very kind and appreciated all that Bollywood has produced ! People like amir sharukh and karan cannot understand why some people oppose them. 1. Karan they have been givin a right by their country to speak against your opinion. 2.  What makes you thing only your opinion is correct and valid.

                            This is the best example of how tolerant are we and our government is. Will anybody dare to speak against their country and motherland? Of course not and if one does, will end up in jail only. India is the only country where you can blabber against and still walks free. Sometime it make us think that we are so coward to take harsh actions against these people.....

Surely, FIRs are scary affair .... something should be done to avoid such harassment. This has been there since decades, but you feel free now to speak about it .... this is truly victory of democracy.

You never felt this country is intolerant when Salman Rushdie was given death threats? you never felt some idiots announced 51 crore bounty fo rthe head of Charlie Hebdo editor? PLEASE STOP HIPOCRACY. It's fashion in Bollywood now a days to say India is intolerant. would you and your other Bollywood friends roam freely in this country if this country is intolerant?<br/>

                            Karan Johar- Pathetic opportunism remarks by you.... Does this so called intolerance has started only now after new govt coming to power or was it not prevailing earlier ... All over India people of all Religion , caste , Gender just file FIR against Film personalities ( some are genuine complaint and some are for publicity )- This has been going for long time and by making such comments now you are indulging in Dirty Politics  .... For every democratic act , there has to be some limit or Lakshan Rekha and no body has got absolute rights to hurt sentiments of others ..... Celebrities must behave in dignified manner but alas.. You have failed and you have started debate once again.. may be some ulterior motive... Your actions are highly condemnable ..

                            Freedom of expression, right to criticise, making fun of others cannot be absolute right. A wise person will not speak anything, which he himself will not like to hear. Crying Intolerance has been latest trend. The Media and Opposition are only eager to highlight such  behaviour for obvious reasons. The so called Intellectuals who have joined this trend lately and some who are victims of this herd mentality are crying Intolerance without understanding the reality.

That was not only 'intolerance', but anticipating and executing what the Congress top would desire.
