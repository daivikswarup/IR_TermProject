New Delhi:Â HighlightsOpposition attacks govt in parliament over Sri Sri event on Yamuna bank
Finance Minister Jaitley: Will the matter be heard here or green court?
Green Tribunal today gave a go-ahead to the event but with conditions
                                The government faced opposition anger in Parliament today over the mega festival organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's Art of Living on the banks of the river Yamuna.
Hours before the three-day World Culture festival, set to open on Friday, was given the go-ahead by the National Green Tribunal with fines and conditions, opposition members confronted the government in the Rajya Sabha."I am not against any cultural festival. But the question arises, what about environment, biodiversity and ecology of this country?" questioned Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.
Union Minister Arun Jaitley shot back: "Will the matter will be heard here or the NGT (National Green Tribunal)?"
Over 1,000 acres on the Yamuna banks have been converted into a makeshift village for the festival that will feature yoga and meditation sessions, peace prayers and cultural performances.
A seven-acre stage has been set up for over 35,000 artistes and visitors from 150 countries. Art of Living has denied any major construction on the river banks but temporary bridges and mobile towers have been built and dirt tracks and a parking area are also coming up, according to a blueprint accessed by NDTV.
Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: "All functions have been given all clearances. As far as Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is concerned, he has launched a campaign to clean the environment in the country. He has started a programme to clean the Yamuna. We should not question his intention."
Members also questioned the use of official resources for the function.
"Can the Indian Army be roped into building two bridges leading up across the Yamuna? I think it's highly irregular that the army is used to build bridges for a private event," said Left leader Sitaram Yechury.
The Green Tribunal, hearing a petition that cites lasting damage to the fragile ecosystem of the Yamuna river, questioned who cleared the event.
Mr Azad said: "Why was no environment clearance taken? The tribunal asked who gave the permission to build bridges over the Yamuna? All construction over the Yamuna will be deemed illegal. Has that been take into consideration?"

                            The Indian Army can't be used for such private events. Period.

                            The Ravi Shankar event was not planned in a day. Many government officers and departments must have known about it from the start. Yet, such a huge exercise was allowed to be taken? Seven acres of stage? On a river bed? Really India.

                            I am not concerned about environment, I am also not concerned about Yamuna, biodiversity etc. A not for profit organization have money to organize such a big event is matter of concern. A 'baba' has such impact that Army is deployed to organize a private function. This is the matter of concern.

                            What a mockery of institutions. Looks like India will never learn from its mistakes. Looks what happened in Chennai just because the rivers were all encroached and buffer zones were completely wiped out. Current damages to Yammuna is a disaster in making. And look the kind of excuses being argued by Sris followers. These kind of events happened in past as well and hence no issues. And they dont even know what they are comparing it against. The Bangalore event was in an airfield with no damage to environment. The Yanni event @ Taj was on the plains not by levelling and damaging the wet lands. And after all how come this private party event (35 years of AOL) became a national event so that Army can be put in service. And what a foolish thing to compare it to Common Wealth Games, Asian Games etc which are true National Events. This is called sheer misuse of influence at power centers. Hope these Gurus start focusing on their own empires and not start messing with state governance !!

                            Why are surprised? Isn't "Opposition" suppose to only bat for minority sentiments and oppose anything remotely connected to Majority values or interests?

                            Did you heard about Yanni and his concert at Yamuna? Did you heard benny and johan dayal? Did you heard about slaughter houses on bank of Yamuna? Did you heard about drainage openly loaded in Yamuna? Did you see Muslims Openly doing Friday prayer on street of kolkala, delhi, Mumbai? <br/><br/>
Army... Why army should protect JNU student who raised anti india slogans? Why army should protect Kashmiri youth who flag ISIS? Why should army do service for anti nationals, jihadi and similar kind of people<br/><br/>
Your Favorite Kanaiya kumar just told that " indian army doing rape in karshmir" ...ok Then let us take our army from Kashmir and put into work similar to Sri sri event. that would be more helpful.<br/><br/><br/>
All about service, if Your favorite keriwal could accept Karachi literature festival then why not army do some cultural service?

                            If Indian army is utilized for any purpose, the entire cost has to be borne by the organizers and it is not free. I remind you that the bill was sent to state government for Pathankot operation as it was done for 26/11 Bombay attack.

                            Whatever criticism there is should have come about much earlier. What was the environment ministry doing when the request for permission were filed in a timely manner by the Art of Living? Why were the papers not processed earlier? Why were objections not raised at that time?Â <br/><br/>
On the flip side,Â large congregations such as these and other religious, spiritual and  political gatherings should not be allowed anywhere. The exception being traditional melas and temple  and other religious gatherings that have been happening regularly for a very long time. Do we even realize the size of the carbon footprint we leave behind after an event like this? All for some Neta to yell his rhetoric, or a bunch of people to drift into lala land, for a few hours, or some spiritual guru to preach his sermon. We learn all kinds of nonsense from the west. Why can't we learn some things that matter, for a change?<br/><br/>
And Sri Sri's contention that any other country would allow it - Of course they would. Why would they say no to tourism, and more money? Whether they would have the best interest of the environment when they agree is debatable.

                            Preparation should have been on the way months before. Why it is an issue suddenly?<br/><br/>
Army builds temporary bridges across Ganga and Yamuna every year for many functions. Why it is big deal now?<br/><br/>
This is taken as issue just to attack government to stop parliament function and not to allow any reforms in this country. I seriously doubt credibility of the people raising this now.

                            Government gives subsidy to the people in JNU who want India's "barbaadi" and who say "Pakistan Zindabad". If that is ok, then nothing wrong with this also.

                            Its not a private party or marriage function of Mulayam or Lalu family.  Nothing wrong in using Army for such kind of Public event. Because people who are suppose to attend ,most of them are common people. And their safety &amp; convenience is very very important. Also it gives Money &amp; some work to the Army guys who are sitting in Delhi cantonment without any work.<br/><br/>
And those who are now all of sudden very much concerned about fragile environment of Yamuna bank are requested to please try to walk along Yamuna in Delhi which is filled with Garbage &amp; Slums.

Environmental disaster yet to be ascertained is not ok but anti national, seditious behaviour is ok, because you and your party is anti hindu in all your actions though not said.
