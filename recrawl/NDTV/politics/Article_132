New Delhi:Â                             With the National Green Tribunal clearing the decks for a three-day cultural extravaganza of Art of Living Foundation on the flood plains of Yamuna river, the Centre today said such temporary programmes or structures "do not" require environment clearances.
"NGT has given permission to them. We had already clarified to NGT that these kinds of programmes and temporary structures do not require environmental clearances under the environmental law and environment notification," Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadedar told news agency PTI.
Amid a raging row over environmental degradation, the green body today cleared the decks for the cultural event scheduled to begin from March 11, but imposed a fine of Rs. 5 crore on Art of Living as environmental compensation.
After posing tough questions, the tribunal also slapped fine of Rs. five lakh on Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Rs. 1 lakh on Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for not discharging statutory functions.
The tribunal's order came on the pleas by NGOs and environmentalists who had sought cancellation of the festival, saying it would seriously endanger the fragile ecosystem on the riverbed.
More than 35 lakh people are expected to arrive at the 'World Cultural Festival'.
