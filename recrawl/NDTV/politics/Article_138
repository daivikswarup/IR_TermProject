New Delhi: Highlights'Unbecoming of Sri Sri to say he would go to jail than pay fine': Court
Sri Sri told NDTV he would go to jail but won't pay the 5 crore fine
Green court, on Tuesday, allowed the 3-day festival with conditions
                                Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's comment that he would "go to jail but not pay fine" for his mega event on the banks of the river Yamuna was sharply disapproved by the country's top environmental court, which said it was unbecoming of him.
"Is it correct that you made a statement that you will not pay Rs. 5 crore fine and rather go to jail?" the National Green Tribunal asked the spiritual guru's Art of Living foundation in a hearing hours ahead of the grand opening of its "World Culture Festival".
The tribunal said it did not expect that kind of comment from Sri Sri Ravi Shankar t as "he has a high stature".
The world famous spiritual guru had made the declaration in interviews to NDTV and other media.
"We have not done anything wrong...we will go to jail but not pay a penny," he told NDTV.
On Tuesday, the tribunal allowed the three-day festival on the banks of the river Yamuna but asked the organisers to pay a fine of Rs. 5 crore for extensive damage to the flood plains, cited by environmentalists.
Art of Living today did not refuse to pay the fine but asked for four weeks to come up with the amount saying it is a "charitable trust" and cannot collect Rs. 5 crore "so quickly in a day".

                            Shameful. Before I have lots of respect for this guy, but now he is no more different that vijay Mallya or Lalit modi. What a lawlessness of Indian govt?
