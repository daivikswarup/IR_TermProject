New Delhi: HighlightsFinance Minister defends black money scheme: 'Not amnesty, has a penalty'
Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi called the scheme 'fair and lovely'
Jaitley attacks Rahul recalling an income disclosure scheme in 1997
                                Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today defended his government's new black or untaxed money scheme announced in the Budget last week, saying "its not an amnesty scheme, it has a penalty."
Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, the minister also attacked the main opposition Congress party, whose leader Rahul Gandhi tore into the government last week over what he called the "fair and lovely scheme."
"When you make comments on steps we are taking from foreign black money to domestic black money to filing prosecutions and assessments, please honestly compare your own track records in this regard," Mr Jaitley said, recalling an income disclosure scheme announced in 1997 by the then Congress government and its finance minister P Chidambaram.
"In 1997, you said, please make declaration of undisclosed income by just paying 30 per cent tax and nothing more, and declare it at the 1987 value. Most declarants were children and women. The immediate effect was that there was no buoyancy in tax collection next year," Mr Jaitley said alleging that the proposal had led the honest tax payer to the courts.
"We have told people if you have any income which has escaped assessment, declare it today, over and above the tax as of the market value today, pay a 50 per cent penalty. So this is not an amnesty scheme, in which there is a 50 per cent penalty," the minister said.Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly attacked the government since the Budget announcement last week. "Those who have black money can pay some tax and simply convert it into white. It's a Fair & Lovely scheme", he had said in the Lok Sabha during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President's address.
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party had tweeted, "BJP vowed to bring back black money thro enforcement, not thro amnesty schemes. This is wat Chidambaram also did. What is the difference? (sic)"
Both the opposition leaders had accused the government of offering amnesty to tax evaders, but punishing the honest salaried class by proposing to tax withdrawals from the Employees Provident Fund, a retirement benefit fund.
Earlier today, Mr Jaitley announced in Parliament that the government is withdrawing the new EPF tax and will conduct a "comprehensive review" of the proposal.

                            Very good decision FM else it would have affected you severely in coming election. Salaried people are the one who pay tax honestly in this county. Think of some innovative idea istead of penalizing middel class.

                            Mr.FM it's a shame that your policies announced in the budget are proving to be an additional burden on the common man. Instead of acknowledging that your are still taking potshots at people who pointed out the flaw and objected to them. How shameless can this government get

                            I like Islamic taxing - Make all money white by paying 2.5 percent taxes. On slab make 10 to 20% only. People will get their black money out. Also just fix 2.5% above 20,000 per month. Any earning person getting 20,000 per month should pay 2.5 percent like Zakat. The Muslims should pay 2.5% Jaziya tax. Let people spend the money instead of hiding it. They can build nice bunglows. They can keep more servants. They can have more cars. Let money should move. Bring Islamic type of taxing. The European countries and UK also considering.

                            It is a good scheme and always was. While of course this won't bring back all the black money people have been claiming has been stashed away, I expect it to bring several thousand crores in form of taxes and penalties.

                            Sometimes it's confusing as to which is the ruling party and which is opposition ? There is only time for street smart dialogue , charges and counter charges . Wish this Govt showed the same energy it shows while responding to the opposition in concentrating on good governance .

                            Mr. Jaitley always wonders how much Rahul knows! Calls him 'expert without knowledge'. Rattled by Rahul's speech 'fair &amp; lovely scheme' now responds to him. Just wait and watch, those who look others down they themselves will automatically be downed. Every one of us is a human and this is the nature of law. It has already begun through Mr. Jaitley's knowledge about economy and Mr. Modi's political analysis about the need of the poor and middle class salaried common man through this Union Budget 16-17.

                            @Feku in india: To the point.....Bharatiya Jhumla Party can only have expertise in Jhumla's. Unfortunately they have no talent yet but to give divisive, narrow minded comments. When it comes to economy, it is a travesty that  BJP has thrown only mediocre FMs....jaitely, sinha n jaswant.......what are their expertise in economic matters and issues. They just follow the congress policy, twist and rename it, recycle and repackage. They are only good at this. They are a total disappointment. Modi went on foreign jaunts to do a PR exercise for himself, and not the country. In fact he insulted Indians and India in his foreign trips for his own ego and self-grandisement. His grand standing has done nothing to Indian economy nor social life.
