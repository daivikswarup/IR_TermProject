Headline::::'Will Lose My Job' If I Speak On Beef Ban, Says Chief Economic Adviser

Mumbai: HighlightsChief Economic Adviser refuses to answer student's question on beef ban
Arvind Subramanian: Don't want to lose my job talking about beef ban 
Student had asked if beef ban will have adverse impact on rural economy
                                Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian refused to answer a question on beef ban saying he did not want "to lose his job".
"You know that if I answer this question I will lose my job. But thank you nevertheless for asking the question," he said on Tuesday while interacting with students of the Mumbai University.He was asked if the beef ban will have any adverse impact on the farmers' incomes or the rural economy, and his reply was met with a round of applause.
The remark by Mr Subramanian, who is on leave from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington since October 2014, comes days after he spoke about the adverse impact of social tensions on development.
"The way you react to social cleavages has a critical impact on economic development. India is a wonderful example. What have reservations done, what have they not done, what has religion done, what has it not done, illustrate the general principle that these things have a huge impact," he had said during a lecture in Bengaluru.
Beef ban became a national issue after a man was lynched by a mob in Dadri on the outskirts of Delhi last year on the suspicion of stocking beef at house.

Even people handpicked by him are scared to even express their opinion, forget taking decisions... The most important thing we are losing under modi is democracy, economy can be gained anytime

                            Mr. Subramanian should talk about Economics and Media also should give him due space for his expert comments. Beef Ban and etc are not the issues for which he was called during interaction with University Students. It seems Media is more Interested in sensational things than his expert comments on Economics and Development. NDTV seems to be searching for such subjects

                            Beef industry is the biggest polluter of the environment. The Amazon forests have been razed for grazing cattle that are then slaughtered for the beef. This economic adviser is hiding this fact. There is enough research done by reputed scientists to prove this linkage. He has answered the question while pretending to not answer it. Moreover, he has made a political statement which is not his job. A majority of Indians do not want beef, so that is the best argument to counter all these Hindu hating fanatics.

                            Though Beef Ban May be Debatable it's surely not a BIG ECONOMIC issue, as there are other meats which are available. Beef may be contributing hardly 1 % of the total meat consumption. And then why was he asked only the question on BEEF BAN? Could they not ask him if Ban on Taslima's books &amp; Rushdie's books have affected the ECONOMICS of Paper Mills &amp; Publishing Industry?

                            Too much has been said on banning beef. The constitution states  clearly that it for the States to pass law(s) on consumption of beef based on local usage/custom. Neither Modi or the central govts  have a say on this. it is a State matter.

                            I do not know how far this news item is true, but even if it was it is such a minor issue that economy of a farmer should depend only on cow as cattle where as he can raise Buffaloes or goats as well. <br/>
It may be pertinent for me state that in certain states of United States the horse meat is banned. Therefore it localised issue and there is no point making it a major news item positioning the Govt as authoritarian. Thanks for giving the opportunity to express my views

                            I am a hard core technocrat who built a house which is 100 % eco-friendly. In fact our house is not a house but a lab with scientific ideas. I support beef ban specially killing of Indian cows ( Bos Indicus family ). This has to do with pure economics including rain fall, soil fertility and human health. I personally has no objection in Holstein or jersy cow beef consuming or export as consumption of them will ruin a persons health but it is an individual choice. Please understand if you eliminate Indian cows then there will be less / no rains, less / improper soil fertility, dependence of poisonous veg, fruits &amp; grains, increase in hospital expenses, wastage of natural resources and so on. Each can be explained scientifically with illustrations. You need to just open your eyes and mind and look into it.
