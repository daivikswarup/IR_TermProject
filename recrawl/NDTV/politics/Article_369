New Delhi: Highlights24 hours before the event, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe drops out
'Inadequacies in protocol and security' cited as the reason by Mugabe
Yesterday, the green court gave a nod for the event but with conditions
                                The humongous event led by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will begin in Delhi tomorrow, amid controversies about whether it will damage the fragile ecosystem of the River Yamuna, but Robert Mogabe, President of Zimbabwe, has decided to turn around from the capital and fly back home because of "substantial inadequacies in protocol and security arrangements".
Mr Mogabe was to serve as the guest of honour at the three-day "World Culture Festival" organised by Sri Sri's Art of Living Foundation. A press statement pointed out that "a number of leaders... including those from the host country, have also withdrawn their participation."
President Pranab Mukherjee dropped out of the event earlier this week amid growing concerns about safety arrangements and potential environmental damage at the 1,000-acre venue on the Yamuna floodplains.
"Mugabe would cut a forlorn figure because he would stick out as the only high-profile Head of State at the World Culture Festival (WCF) organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living," reported a news site in Zimbabwe. 
Yesterday, the National Green Tribunal allowed the event to go ahead but asked for the organisers to deposit an initial five-crore fine (with the probability of more to follow after the event); the judges also made a series of remarks censuring the organisers and various government departments and ministries for failing to take enough precautions to protect the environment.
Sri Sri has firmly rebutted allegations by activists that construction at the venue -including a giant stage for thousands of performers from around the world - and  a vast audience running into lakhs of people could hurt the Yamuna. He has committed to his foundation creating a biodiversity park after the event concludes -an offer which was made part of the court's conditional permission.

                            That is the way to set the right example. Better sense has prevailed. Environment comes far ahead of parties - however powerful might be the person throwing it!!

                            After Sri Sri, our own Baba Ramdev will want to outdo with his own even. The question will be which land will he grab and also destroy.

                            When the police themselves are unable to guarantee the safety of our PM, how can they guarantee safety of other high profile guests. If 35 lakh people turn up, it will be a huge security mess to deal with.

                            All the Sadhus turned politicians have no constructive work to do. They create these kind of mess and waste everyone time and resources.

                            Only a  despot knows another  despot. What a glaring misuse of government support! Initial approval for people was for only 3 lakh people and now 35 lakh are turning up. Initial approval for land was for only 30 acres of land, now its more than 1000 acres. To get this 1000 acres, even green lands have been turned into barren lands. People in that area have been driven out! Scary details are emerging by every minute!  Now this Ravi is trying to turn this into a communal issue. Nobody is against his good work or  such meeting, but please dont do it in the already damaged banks of river of this magnitude!! The damage is already been done!! God alone save this country.

                            Is the AoL so desperate for international publicity that they invite a man who was regarded as the most hated leader in all of Africa. He took Zimbabwe from being the bread basket of Africa to being a starving banana republic. Surely, this is pathetic.
