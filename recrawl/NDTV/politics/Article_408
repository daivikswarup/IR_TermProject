New Delhi:Â Highlights'Unbecoming of Sri Sri to say he would go to jail than pay fine': Court
Sri Sri told NDTV he would go to jail but won't pay the 5 crore fine
Green court, on Tuesday, allowed the 3-day festival with conditions
                                Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's comment that he would "go to jail but not pay fine" for his mega event on the banks of the river Yamuna was drew a sharp rebuke from the country's top environmental court, which said it was unbecoming of him.
"Is it correct that you made a statement that you will not pay Rs. 5 crore fine and rather go to jail?" the National Green Tribunal asked the spiritual guru's Art of Living foundation in a hearing hours ahead of the grand opening of its "World Culture Festival".
The tribunal said it did not expect that kind of comment from Sri Sri Ravi Shankar as "he has a high stature".
When Art of Living agreed to pay the amount - Rs. 25 lakh today and the rest over three weeks - the court noted: "Good sense has prevailed. If people like him start violating the directions of the court then what about ordinary people? It will send the wrong signal."
The world famous spiritual guru had made the declaration in interviews to NDTV and other media.
"We have not done anything wrong...we will go to jail but not pay a penny," he told NDTV.
On Tuesday, the tribunal allowed the three-day festival on the banks of the river Yamuna but asked the organisers to pay a fine of Rs. 5 crore for extensive damage to the flood plains, cited by environmentalists.
Art of Living today said it is a "charitable trust" and cannot collect Rs. 5 crore "so quickly in a day".

                            Leave 5 crore fine levy on an individual's money to a side. Go after 5000 crore defaulter of public money who lives a mega rich life style, has multi million dollar homes across the globe and yet claims to be bankrupt.

                            LOL. Sri Sri should have kept his mouth shut. Now if he has any bit of self respect or dignity he should go to jail instead of accepting and paying fine

                            Why is so much importance being given to this effeminate little bearded fellow?  Remove the beard and what you are looking at is an old woman!  It is almost certain that the fellow is gay but that is a matter for him.  I don't need lessons in the art of living.

                            Some "immature" guys are bringing Religion into this act by Green tribunal and justifying the act of Sri Sri. if the same event was conducted by an Christian or Muslim organization...etc. blah blah<br/>
Guys, please grow up, no one has issue with Sri Sri personally, please note this event is called "World Culture Festival" and I don't think it would have been different even if it is called Hindu Cultural Festival.<br/>
The issue is the location,  spread over 1,000 acres of the Yamuna's floodplains, will irreversibly corrode the fragile ecosystem of the area. <br/>
Where is religion coming into this environmental issue? U need not from any particular religion or caste/creed to raise environmental issues which will affect generations of people. <br/>
I have no issues on Sri Sri conducting this event, but he should have followed the rules and got proper clearances, to set an example to others.

                            This is not good of Sri Ravi Shankar  I hope he had not said it &amp; I wish he apologized to people &amp; court . I had lot of respect for him but he should not say such things  .if a person like him does not respect NGT then who will respect .he should have set an example by following rules &amp; obey the orders or tomorrow every body will stop obeying rules &amp; court orders. I would rather suggest court order to stop the function &amp; set an example

                            Well, to put things in perspective,(and without taking any side) Mahatma Gandhi once said that in a court - that he will not pay fine but is wiling to go to jail..... as shown in the movie "Gandhi"

                            To be honest, now a days judges are behaving like activists. If they had a problem, they shouldn't have waited so close to the event. And about the NGO which filed the complaint, it's obvious they don't have any other relevant work to do, other than media publicity and eating government schemes. So disgusting system we have on our country.

                            It's no use blaming Sri Sri so late as this.What was our so called "Powerful system"-maintained by the tax payers'money- doing all these days till the last moment appeared? Why was  no timely interception attempted? Isn't it a gross negligence on their part.They should fist be drawn into legal procedures and and action taken according to law.
