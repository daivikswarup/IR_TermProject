Panaji:Â                             The BJP-led government in Goa is the "most discredited government in the country", Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Ashutosh said today, saying his party is keen on contesting the 2017 Assembly election in the state.
But a final decision on whether the Aam Aadmi Party would contest elections in Goa would be taken soon by the Political Affairs Committee, headed by Delhi Chief Minister and national convenor Arvind Kejriwal, Mr Ashutosh told the media.
"The BJP government in Goa is the most discredited government in the country. I did not imagine a BJP government can be as discredited as this... The people of Goa have no love for the Congress either. AAP is seriously considering contesting the 2017 Assembly election," Mr Ashutosh said.
The AAP leader was in Goa to review the organisational affairs of the AAP in Goa.
The Goa Assembly elections are due in early 2017. "People in Goa are looking for an alternative. The AAP could be that alternative," he said.
The Bharatiya Janata Party dismissed the AAP charges.
State BJP president Vinay Tendulkar told IANS that the question of who was discredited and who was not would be answered after the 2017 Assembly polls.
"The BJP will win 26 seats on its own in 2017. Let us see whether AAP can win even one seat," Mr Tendulkar said.
The AAP leader said Mr Kejriwal would address a public meeting in Goa soon.
He said the AAP had never aligned with any political party. "AAP is not a conventional political party. We present an alternative form of politics for the people."
AAP national secretary Pankaj Gupta said the party had collected enough funds to start an election campaign in Goa.
"Our target for Goa is around Rs. 6-12 crore... We have collected enough funds to start our election campaign," Mr Gupta said.

                            Yes, AAP is providing alternative form of politics alright. Defamatory, allegation-without-proof-based, hit and run alternative.
