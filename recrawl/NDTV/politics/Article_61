Headline::::Marriage Sacred in India, So Marital Rape Does Not Apply: Government



DateTime::::2015-04-30T10:32:19+05:30



New Delhi:                             The concept of marital rape does not apply in India as marriage is treated as sacred here, the government said in Parliament today.
"It is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including level of education, illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat marriage as a sacrament," Minister of State for Home, Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary said in the Rajya Sabha.
He was replying to a written question by DMK's K Kanimozhi, who had asked whether the government was planning to amend the law to make marital rape a crime. She had also asked whether the UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women had recommended to India that marital rape should be criminalised.
Ms Kanimozhi cited a UN estimate that 75 per cent of the married women in India are subjected to marital rape.
In response, the minister said that the UN panel had, indeed, recommended that marital rape should be made a criminal offence, but added there was no move to do so.
"The Law Commission of India did not recommend criminalisation of marital rape by amending the exception to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code and hence presently there is no proposal to bring any amendment to the IPC in this regard," the Minister said.

                            Is this RSS thug then says that it is sacred duty of the women to let her husband rape her as and when he wants, as many times he wants and however he wants?!! Marriage, like any consensual affair, is a contract and *both* the parties must be protected from misuse/abuse. Looks like RSS/BJP just wants to protect only men and are anti-women. If marriage is a sacrament, what is divorce sherlock?!! Divorce alone is an evidence that marriage is a contract.. Please don't use our ancient religion to suppress women.

                            Having sex with a woman without her consent is rape u dumb headed male chauvinist pig. Marriage is a bond and marital rape is totally another thing so citing marriage as a reason for rape shows ur mindset.

                            What else to expect from a minister whose PM abandoned his wife! I know it is child marriage, but Modi must have taken responsibility and annul the marriage at the earliest. Instead, he lets the poor women suffer: married, but had no pleasures and benefits of marriage. It is cruel. Modi did it anyway because he doesn't care and he is anti-women.

                            Although Marital rape shld be a crime, in INDIA it will be misused to no end. Can you imagine the no of women who will file false cases in court about marital rape to vent their anger and frustration at their husbands or to blackmail them? I think all Indians will be fighting cases in courts!  In INDIA, cases such as dowry act etc are abused like hell! Unfortunately the true cases get dissolved in all the false cases making it very hard to prove or disprove!

                            True..this cannot be applied in Indian context. Remember the misuse of 498a Anti-Dowry harassment law. If marital rape is legally considered, a wife can have good sexual relations with her husband and still choose to file a rape case against him. This will ONLY become an instrument of harassment against innocent husbands. In short the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits.

                            Marriage presumes that both have conjugal rights. if you are not willing to because you are not in mood for months, well, better not enter into a relationship. If husbands are to stop using force then wives must stop using husbands as a financial plan. IRBM, 498a, 354, etc. are enough already for 65000 men committing suicide per year. I hail this decision, and I hope this does not become another grossly misused and draconian law.

                            Marriage or rather an idea of a marriage may be sacred but people involved in it are not. So to say something in which people are involved remains sacred is totally preposterous. Marriage can get as sick as people can get.

                            I have a simple question. If you dont like to have sex with a man, why staying married to him ? Why not divorce ? If a woman does not want to divorce due to circumstances, children, family pressure, society whatever, wouldnt those circumstances prevent from filing a case against husband as well ? This law will only help women who want to enjoy husband's wealth while he is languishing in prison and those who want to control husbands by fear.

Rather stop instantaneosly if there was any sign of discontent. I respect all women , please don't make a slave out of me. I also am a living being just like a woman. Please don't look at me as a rapist, wife beating, dowry demanding Indian husband. I am not. Twice the number of men died than women because of marital discord and abuse. Men are sensitive too. i am an Indian male and I have a right to live and with dignity.

                            I congratulate the govt for making a good decision instead of trying to ape western laws. People who think this decision as stupid, archaic simply do not understand the problem comprehensively and the enormous impact it has on social fabric of the society. Do you want to put up an application to govt office for sex every time you wish to have it ? Good luck with that. Treating this as a law and order problem is the most in humane way of treating this. Let's uderstand the underlying problems. First recognize the problem is faced by both men and women. Person may be disinclined or want  to have sex because of work, family, financial, health of dear ones or ones own self, news on tv, newspaper, novel one is reading or tv serials they are watching or movies they are seeing .  The impact can be for longer durations running into months. Govt may provide free facilities for counseling which can include Ayurvedic (because it's wholesome approach), yoga, sex therapists and family counseling .

                            Can bhakts defend this as well? I guess so. If BJP takes over Modi, the government is finished. But I really doubt now, there is any difference anyways?

                            This government should be called the Fringe Lunatic government. What next, I wonder?

                            DMK MP Kanimozhi has set off a series of debate on marital rape. Yes, this is some thing that we need to see how to address. We can not allow our women to suffer in silence. Hope the public and the government come with a solution to this problem instead of covering it up under religious sentiments, in which the men take cover and exploit the women.

                            Sh. Haribhai's statement in Rajya Sabha about MARITAL RAPE shows his true picture of Indianness. Whatever he has said must be applied in to-to to this country. Any dilution in this regard wil weaken this loving country. I wholeheartedly stand by his holy statement.

                            Marriage is sacred in India . So lets allow rape, abuse, violence mental and emotional torture to save marriage . Because Human beings and their feelings aren't sacred, but non living things are sacred.

                            Few years back, in Gandhinagar Hyderabad , one guy spurned the advances of the girl in same locality. The girl told her brother that the guy has been harassing her. Her brother planned for roughing up the guy along with his friends. The guy died because of the assault. Intention of the assault was to protect the dignity of a women. Result was a death of an innocent young man. Why bring more laws to murder Indian males legally? Respecting a woman comes from ones religion and human values. Traditionally a lot of significance is given for saving oneself for marriage - both genders and lead a life of monogamy.  Anything less than that is looked down. from this angle its logical to think, people who save themselves till marriage need to be protected at any cost. Corollary people who indulge in pre marital sex seem to loose the right to be not violated. Remember dented and painted comment? In you are religious or believe in human values , you would respect a prostitute(m/f) as a person. It should never be conditional.

                            Will Modi defend this stand of his government in Madison square garden? The fact that he only talks and RSS implements their agenda, is proved by every action of the central and BJP state governments. I have to accept that Mr. Modi is a fantastic spokesperson for his party, unfortunately he is a fringe element.

                            One contact by the Husband, and now his life is ruined forever. Kudos! Ladies! Now husbands can never mess with us. Besides, Indian law too assumes that women don't lie. Thanks

                            @: Chakraborty: The picture paints a man who just raped his wife and is feeling jolly good about it. This is our culture. The English missionaries came and destroyed Sati - blame then for destroying what we hold sacred. One by one the western culture and religion will destroy us.

                            WHOAAA...Look who is talking about law. Kanimozhi,, what law should be passed to punish people like your grandfather (Karunanidhi)for having 3 wifes at the same time. How is he not getting punizhed?So your idea is people like your grandfather can have as many wifes as they want as long as he threatens them and they do not come out in the open? Be ashamed? And what punishment should be given for someone like you who has illicit relationship with another man,Raja, and swindling tax payers money in crores? Should you not be hanged? Now you are talking about law just to gain attention. You are a black spot for humanity.

                            This is how antidowry law came in and people who really need to use this doesn't even aware. <br/><br/>
If this comes, I am sure this will be missused. Better not to have it at the first place.

                            We have seen how anti domestic violence law and anti dowry law are misused, similarly marital rape law will be also mis used and in this case it is very difficult to prove misuse. If women think that marital rape law is required, men also has right to protest about misuse of marital rape law. Any law should be balanced, should not have loopholes &amp; there should be checks &amp; balances to prevent misuse. Why cannot we have make family/marriage related laws gender neutral

                            misrpresentating the facts is educated netizen, am not sure how many of them aware that female gender who are unable to use internet are the ones who think husband is god, go try preach these women to come out of the marriage, she will not.                 let's first make our law become simple to intemperate, else each will find loopholes to drag a case
