New Delhi: HighlightsVijay Mallya to appear for questioning on March 18, say officials
Money-laundering case against Mallya for 900-crore loan
Haven't fled India, Mallya tweeted this morning, reportedly from UKVijay Mallya, who left the country earlier this month, has been ordered to appear for questioning in Mumbai on March 18 in a case of money-laundering.
 
In a tweet this morning, Mr Mallya, who built his fortune partly with Kingfisher beer and then ran into financial disaster with Kingfisher Airlines, rejected that he has fled India as banks move to collect nearly a billion dollars owed by the airline.
 

Mr Mallya, who is also a member of the Rajya Sabha, left India on March 2, reportedly for England, though his spokespersons have not confirmed his whereabouts. His office, when contacted by NDTV, did not confirm whether he will obey the summons for next week.  
The Enforcement Directorate this week filed a case of money-laundering, alleging that Mr Mallya illicitly used a 900-crore loan from the state-run IDBI to service other debts and sent large sums abroad.The government has been accused of "criminal conspiracy" by the opposition Congress for allowing Mr Mallya's exit. But the government has said that when Mr Mallya flew abroad, there was no legal restriction on his travel.
Last year, the CBI, which is investigating how and why state-run banks bestowed heavy loans on the entrepreneur without adequate protection, had ordered a lookout notice to airports to stop Mr Mallya, 60, from traveling abroad.  But a month later, the agency loosened the check, asking only to be informed if the parliamentarian was boarding an international flight.
CBI sources have also said that Mr Mallya's passport could not be suspended or impounded because the cases against him had not progressed to a point where he could legally be restrained from traveling.

                            All the banks top officers enjoyed the Mallaya s hospitality and given the loan without adequate security must be arrested and a thorough enquiry will bring out who ever the god father of the tycoon.when a poor farmer who owned about a lakh to the bank was thrashed by police,why banks delayed going to court to impound his passport.The bankers are equally culprits and must be punished.

                            This should be interesting. Lets see how the international businessman will respond...<br/><br/>
I'm guessing he will develop an immediate illness which will make it difficult to travel to India. <br/><br/>
The said illness will however not prevent him from partying elsewhere in the world. This illness will then continue until the public forgets about this and moves on. Then all will be back to normal....

                            this is how namo gang is trying to get the black money back to ?, probably to their proxy a/c.<br/>
earlier it was IPL ex boss, now KFA (atleast two in news, lot of others may have had the dealing underground).<br/>
From one Corrupt Party to another Corrupt Party, what change do our Indian people wants. <br/>
Keep voting the corrupt and get only Corrupt Government, so simple corrupt people elects corrupt people (Atleast use NOTA).

                            Govt of India can ask British Government to de-part Vijay Mallya from their country. GOI can give in-terpol notice to all countries so that Vijay Mallya cannot go to those countries
