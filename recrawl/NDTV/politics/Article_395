Headline::::CBI Had Said Vijay Mallya Should Be Stopped At Airport. Then, A Revision.

New Delhi:                             The CBI, which is facing heat over allowing embattled businessman Vijay Mallya to go abroad, had changed the nature of lookout notice against him within one month of issuance from seeking his detention while leaving the country to that merely providing information about his travel plans.
The information came as further embarrassment to the agency which has been accused of going soft on Mr Mallya, facing a CBI probe for defaulting on repayment of a loan of Rs. 900 crore taken from IDBI.Sources said, in its October 16, 2015 request to issue a lookout circular, the CBI had said if Mr Mallya tries to leave the country, he should be detained at the exit point. Nearly a month later in November, the agency asked for a revised circular where it asked the Bureau of Immigration to inform it about his departure and travel plans.
The sources said Mr Mallya travelled abroad in October and returned in November, while he made two trips in first and last week of December and also a trip in January besides the recent trip reportedly to London on March 2.
The lookout circular depends on the issuing authority and, unless they ask the Bureau of Immigration to detain a person or to stop him from boarding a plane, no action is taken.
The sources said after the CBI changed the lookout notice, the immigration bureau did not make any attempt to stop him from travelling abroad and every time he travelled the agency was duly informed about it.
When asked why the CBI did not seek to impound his passport to stop his movement abroad, the agency sources said Mr Mallya had been cooperating in the investigation by presenting himself for questioning, as and when required, and also providing documents sought by the agency.
The CBI sources said, according to a Supreme Court judgment, passport of a person can only be impounded when he has been chargesheeted or a trial is pending against him.
Since he had been cooperating, there was no reason to stop him from moving abroad, they said, adding he had appeared for questioning thrice since the lookout notices were issued, once here and twice in Mumbai between December 9 and 12, 2015.
They also said the agency was keeping track of his movement but did not interfere as he always returned.
The CBI had registered a case against Mr Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, Chief Financial Officer of the airlines A Raghunathan, and unknown officials of IDBI Bank in its FIR alleging that Rs. 900 crore IDBI loan was sanctioned in violation of norms regarding credit limits on the basis of complaint received from the bank.
Clarifying his position regarding the loan owed by KFA, Mr Mallya, in a recent statement had said after the closure of the airline, since April, 2013, the banks and their assignees have recovered, in cash, an aggregate of Rs. 1,244 crore from sale of pledged shares.
"In addition an aggregate of Rs. 600 crore is lying deposited in the Karnataka High Court (since July, 2013) and a further sum of Rs. 650 crore belonging to United Breweries Holdings has been deposited in the Karnataka High Court since early 2014, being sums realised from the sale proceeds received by United Breweries Holdings from the sale of shares in United Spirits to Diageo Plc in July, 2013," he had said.
"Thus, the aggregate cash recovery/security available is Rs. 2,494 crore," Mr Mallya had said in the statement. The Attorney General informed the Supreme Court yesterday that he has been told by CBI that Mr Mallya has left the country on March 2.
The bench issued notice to Mr Mallya and sought his response within two weeks on pleas filed by a consortium of banks seeking direction for freezing his passport and his presence before the apex court.

                            Money talks.. There are two types of law in this country. One for those with money and a different one for those without money.

                            looks like he is making effort to repay. lets not judge someone without looking at details. clearly mallya travelled thrice this year and returned. I think he might return this time too. also if he has demonstrated his willingness to pay, by paying 2900 crores, that is a good thing..

                            the only cure for this continuous malady of this corrupt and ineffective agency is to make it a creature ounder Parliamentary control so that no stupid politician can play games. the whole organization must be revamped top to bottom  so that it really becomes an effective investigating agency of the Centre.

                            First of all, I am not supporting Mallya. But, most people in these columns comment from a very high and superficial manner, rather than exactly knowing what has happened with this case. Even I do not know exactly, but what I could guess is, there were more corrupt people other than Mallya in this case and they all played a role. Then, for various reasons the airlines went bankrupt and the case is lodged. There are some securities given, some money en-cashed and the for the balance, it is a process to recover. When the process is going on, it is going to take time and not going to be easy, you just cannot go and lock out all his personal properties and say " oh, it is now the property of the bank", I do not think that is how a business dealing work. There are procedures and he is not running away and he comes back to India as reported. All this media and people make this as a huge news, he has run out of the country, he is a thief etc., etc., there are other bigger thieves in this country happily enjoying life. This media is playing too much of nonsense these days which corrupt people's mind. This is my opinion.

                            Look, it is and it was for the banks to have taken more prompt action; they are not acting at the required efficiency since 2013; Mallya has not been a pronounced defaulter by any court in India and hence if CBI had blocked his travel, CBI would have been in soup!<br/><br/>
More than anything else, it is the system in India (it is the same in all democratic countries) that makes it extremely difficult for lenders to attach, take control and sell the collateral of any borrower.<br/><br/>
In this case, the banks had attached the aircraft - but what use they were leased ones! They started rotting at the airports!!<br/><br/>
Moral of the story is: Banks - do not lend unless you have 125% of value of the loan pledged to you as saleable collateral; keep revaluing the collateral each year and reduce the loan if the value falls...<br/><br/>
Do not go by govt dictats to expand your lendings!<br/><br/>
Do not take refinance from govt/RBI which is to motivate banks to lend more without govt/RBI taking the liability!!<br/><br/>
Lastly, the moment a covenant is dishonoured, bring the matter to court and monetise the collateral - do not let the matter drift thinking that it would improve. <br/><br/>
Act like a smart, street money lender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
