Jaipur:Â                             Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh will consider replacing its khaki shorts with trousers at the annual meeting of Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the highest decision making body of the outfit, beginning tomorrow.
"Several proposals have come up for change in Ganvesh (uniform) and this will be discussed in the annual meeting of ABPS. This will be about replacing knickers with full pants. Several proposals regarding its colour are also there but the colour will not be khakhi," Akhil Bhartiya Prachar Pramukh of RSS, Manmohan Vaidya said.He said that the issue was debated in 2010 but since there was no consensus it was deferred for five years, adding that the discussion on the matter resumed last year.
Mr Vaidya said representatives from all over the country will discuss progress in their respective areas of work, innovations, achievements and experience at the three-day meeting, conducted every year in March.
The RSS leader added 92 training programmes will be conducted in the country this year, in which 15,000-20,000 participants will take part at different levels.
"All these things will be discussed in the meeting," he said.

                            The RSS is a cultural organization and it cannot have trousers as uniform. That is English European dress. The proper thing is to have a dhoti, pure Indian dress. If it decides on trousers then it would anti indian culture.
