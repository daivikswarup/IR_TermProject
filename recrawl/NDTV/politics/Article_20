HighlightsGreen court hearing petition to stop event as fine yet to be paid
PM Modi expected to kick off event on the banks of Yamuna at 3pm today
'Will go to jail but won't pay the 5 crore fine', said Sri Sri
                                At 3 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to inaugurate the massive Sri Sri Ravi Shankar festival on the banks of the River Yamuna.  In a last-ditch attempt, activists have asked India's top environmental court to stop the event because the spiritual leader and his organisation have not complied with an order to deposit a five-crore fine before the "World Culture Festival" begins.
The National Green Tribunal has agreed to urgently hear the petition.  Security has been increased outside the court after reports of demonstrations against the event.
 
On Wednesday, its judges cleared the three-day festival on the floodplains of the River Yamuna, berating both the organizers and government departments for failing to take enough steps to protect the venue's delicate ecosystem.  The court said its sanction for the event rests on conditions like a 5-crore penalty to be paid in advance and a commitment from the organizers to create a biodiversity park after the festival ends.
Yesterday, Sri Sri, 59, told NDTV, "We will go to jail but not pay a penny.  We have done nothing wrong."  The green court said hours later that his Art of Living Foundation had till today to comply with the penalty.

                            I have lost all the respect I had for Sri Ravishankar and the Art of Living foundation after this. The court has made a judgement and if he wanted he could have appealed it or paid the fine and be done with it. But instead he is disrespecting the court and disobeying the judgement. This is the biggest problem in India, the absence of the rule of law. Hopefully the court will stand its ground and cancel the event.

                            PM Modi should cancel his visit if they don't comply to the court order.
