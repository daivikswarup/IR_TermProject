Headline::::Bankrupt Or Bankrolled? The Mystery Of Vijay Mallya's Untouched Wealth

New Delhi:Â HighlightsVijay Mallya's stake in different companies adds up to over 9,000 crores
Mallya says many of his shares pledged to banks
He goes to court when banks try to sell some of these shares
                                Going by their public statements, the only substantial Vijay Mallya assets that banks appear to have in their possession are Kingfisher's corporate headquarters in Mumbai and an assortment of luxury toys like yachts and private jets.
But even if all of these are sold, they are unlikely to make a significant dent in his overall debt of Rs. 9000 crores to a consortium of 17 banks accumulated mainly for his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.
The banks have moved court, asking Mr Mallya to declare his hidden assets but there appear to be crores of assets in plain view - for instance, the approximately Rs. 2400 crores he earned from the sale in 2014 of his stake in his spirits company, United Spirits, to Diageo.The shares were sold by United Breweries Holding Company in which the 60-year-old has a controlling stake - directly or through a web of promoter companies. These earnings are rarely mentioned by banks even though the deal took place in 2012 by which time Mr Mallya was mired in debt. Even after the sale, Mr Mallya retains a substantial chunk of USL shares, worth almost 150 crores rupees.
Also, the entrepreneur retains a roughly 32 per cent stake in United Breweries, maker of Kingfisher Beer. The net worth of his stake at current market value: a whopping Rs. 6800 crores.
Just these assets add up to Rs. 9,400 crores. Mr Mallya claims he has pledged a good chunk of these shares to banks and lenders, and in a recent statement said that they have already recovered about Rs. 1,200 crores from selling these shares. He also says another Rs. 1,200 crores is deposited in banks to be claimed, about half of which are proceeds from his deal with Diageo.
But what "the King of Good Times" doesn't mention is that every time an attempt is made to sell the pledged shares, he takes legal action. United Breweries's annual report for 2014 says "The Consortium of Banks have sold in periodical lots certain investments belonging to the Company pursuant to a purported Pledge Agreement dated December 21, 2010. The Company and others have filed a suit in the Hon'ble Bombay High Court against the Consortium of Banks."
This raises questions as to whether a combination of bank reluctance and Mr Mallya's aggressive legal tactics keep him in possession of a substantial chunk of his wealth, allowing him to maintain his profligate lifestyle.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations by NDTV suggest that right through the time he was labelled a "wilful defaulter" by banks, he had spent or committed at least Rs. 20 crores. This includes picking up a team in the Caribbean Premier League for 13.5 crores and agreeing to pay player salaries (an estimated Rs. 5 crores annually) in February, and committing Rs. 3 crores to the Kingfisher Ultra Derby in November 2015.
For his lavish birthday party in Goa in December last year, around the time he was being questioned by the CBI about his debts, he flew down pop star Enrique Iglesias for a performance. Enquiries made by NDTV suggest that the singer's appearance fee is about Rs. 3.40 crores.
Listed above are just Mr Mallya's known assets and known expenses. As the Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohatgi, told the Supreme Court, the liquor baron's overseas assets, if ever unearthed, can more than pay off the debt.
But trying to seize and dispose of those may be a long haul, given that even the wealth under the nose of banks remains perplexingly out of reach.(Watch more on Truth vs Hype: Inside the Mallya Empire, Saturday 9:30pm, Sunday 7:30pm NDTV 24x7)

                            Mallya's companies are all listed limited liability companies - so , legally you cannot attach his entire wealth just like that. The SC did not even allow impounding passport yesterday. Till we prove that he bribed Banks and laundered the money to stash abroad , the case is so weak. Banks should have made the case after 2009 but then, they got the bribes. Why did the UPA not force this ... hmm , interesting. And India can get him extradited. Lets not leap to silly conclusions.

                            This type of mystery wealth is only possible if corrupt politicians hold the umbrella. BJP has proved that it has no shortage of corrupt politicians.

                            Why there is no cases and prosecution of Bank officials who granted loans to Mallaya. This money does not belong to these bank officials it is public money and they are custodians only. Fist put these officials behind bars and truth will come-up partially.

                            KFA started in 2005 and wound up in 2011. The UB group was weathly 50 years before KFA started. So how can you associate the wealth with KFA. A large mumbai group in oil and power has defaulted 20000 crores to 3 banks india. Please chase that too.

                            The banks just need to employ a team of clever lawers. It seems that Mallya is being protected and advised by some SC judge.

                            It is not Mallya's fault. Question is why Bank gave 9000 Cr loan on just 10% security which is against policy .

                            If BJP keeps on saying that whatever Wrongdoings or financial irregularities are being exposed today are done at UPA's time, and that what can they do about it now, then they are surely going to face the same mandate in 2019 what UPA faced in 2014. People had trusted this Government that they will not allow corruption anymore and will punish who are being involved and therefore they have been given such a big mandate by people of the country. So BJP should stop this chanting now and start taking action on the guilty.

                            Firstly the Banks must move to make him Bankrupt, unless Mallaya satisfies them of his ability to repay instantly.  If they wait or do not it only means one thing. Corruption. <br/>
If his Indian passport is cancelled he may be left with very little options. No use CBI has junkets in London as in many cases before.

                            Most of us are being ignorant , all our busy pointing out mallya but how many of us truly pay our taxes for everything don't you guys show fake medical bills rent receipts for escaping tax ?? Bribing cops when caught on vehicles so that u end up paying less? We all are culprits in a way! And you guys pointing out fingers are the biggest hypocrites ever!<br/><br/>
He had to come to this state because of the taxes government put on his airlines which made him go bankrupt.. He has built several roads in Bangalore and has many charitable trusts.. Sure he did do some wrongs but he single handedly built a huge empire and put India on the map showcasing to the world..<br/><br/><br/>
How many of you know that mallya bought the Gandhi glass and the blood when he died from the British in an auction and donated it to a museum in India??<br/><br/><br/>
Just think people before u comment don't be a hypocrite!

                            Bank oficials who gave him such huge loans must also be investigated. Were they rewarded in return for disbursing such bad loans? If Mallya is under the scanner these public sector bank employees should also be under the scanner.
