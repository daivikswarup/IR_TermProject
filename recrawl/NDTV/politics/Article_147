Guwahati:Â                             Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi today claimed that the people of the state have realised that Prime Minister Modi made tall promises to them and failed to deliver on what he had promised.
"Modi knows how to make tall promises but people have realised that these are hollow and the Prime Minister has failed to deliver what he had promised," Mr Gogoi told reporters in Guwahati.
"Modi has exploited the sentiments of the people who were taken in by his promises during the last Parliamentary polls and had voted for him. They have now realised that it was all false and people's response to recent Congress meetings have been very positive," he said.
PM Modi's "marketing skill is excellent and superb but the product is zero and he cannot keep fooling the people always," the chief minister added.
"His schemes are like spurious medicines which instead of curing various ills proves counter-productive and creates more problems," he said.
The BJP government led by PM Modi has created divisions within society which were never seen before in the country and it cannot be allowed to continue, the Congress leader said.
He had promised to bring down prices, create employment opportunities, make the country corruption-free but has failed on all fronts, Mr Gogoi alleged.
"In Assam, he had promised to solve the foreigners issue but for him all Muslims are foreigners. He had promised to scrap the land deal with Bangladesh which we had favoured but went ahead with it," Mr Gogoi said.
Instead, PM Modi curtailed development funds, withdrew special category status and abolished the North East Industrial Promotion Policy, Gogoi said adding, "These steps have exposed him and the BJP," he said.
Mr Gogoi claimed the BJP's mission of winning 84 seats in the forthcoming state Assembly polls will remain a dream and the Congress would return to power for the fourth consecutive term.

                            Dear Mr. Gogoi<br/>
One of the Eastern states has successfully prevented the communal poison being spread in Bihar. It is up you Mr.Gogoi, fighting a do or die battle , to prevent the communal poison from entering the North-east. The whole of India shall be grateful to you if you could achieve this

                            GoGo Mr. CM. Your days in power are numbered. Lets see who wins, is it the people who love this country and want to develop this state to a high standard it deserves or remain bitten by venom your party has been pumping in in the name of secularism.

                            Beware of goons, Assam, Kerala &amp; all states going to poll soon. Need to reject these goons and teach them a lesson similar to Delhi &amp; Bihar so that there can be peaceful environment all over. Don't be fooled by fake promises, decide for yourselves to keep such goons who don't care about the law of the land. None of these gong to help reduce prices and corruption(so much was sung about it before elections and now it is still very much on...), just no one...no one is interested in doing it. In addition, you will have all goons creating hatred and disturbing atmosphere all over.

People of Assam must wake up or else they will destroy future of their children. Let people of Assam vote intelligently or perish. The choice is for the people of Assam.
