Chandigarh:Â                             The Haryana government will introduce a bill in the Assembly in the forthcoming session to grant reservation to five communities, including the Jats, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said today.
He said that the state government would introduce a new bill in the Assembly session beginning from March 14 for reservation to five communities, namely Jats, Jat Sikhs, Tyagis, Bishnois and Rors.
Mr Khattar said that a five-member committee had already been constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to prepare draft of the bill to grant reservation under the ambit of Constitution. He said that an all-party committee was also being set up to give suggestions for drafting of the bill.
The BJP government in the state had promised reservation for the Jat community and others after the recent Jat agitation for reservation left the state paralysed for nine days. At least 30 people were killed, over 200 injured and property worth hundreds of crores was destroyed as the agitation turned violent.
The chief minister urged presidents of all registered political parties to send the name of their representative to the government for this committee.
"In case the all-party committee is able to draft the new bill unanimously, it would be passed in the Vidhan Sabha without any discussion," Mr Khattar said in a statement.
The Khattar government has said that people associated with the agitation and others could submit their suggestions regarding reservation so that their suggestions could be incorporated while drafting the bill.
Mr Khattar made it clear that the existing 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the state would not be disturbed.
The statement is significant as non-Jat communities from the OBCs were objecting to the Jat and other communities being included in the existing reservation for OBCs.
The chief minister also appealed to the people in the state to maintain peace and brotherhood and not be swayed by rumours.

                            BJP before election was a party with difference. After election, it is worst than other political parties.
