Once in power, blaming the other for the ills facing the country while generating maximum black money for themselves. God bless our country and save the common man.

                            smriti irani the nation is not interested in your personal fight with rahul gandhi. you both are illiterates. May be because you are a tv artist you can deliver your scripted dialogues better than him. we adivise you to voluntarily resign and allow some visionary unbiased and inclusive educationist to lead the ministry of education. There are dozens of such doyen present in BJP. Are you not ashamed that every day you are involved in some controversy or the other because you are unsuitable for the position? Ask modi to give you some other ministry where education doesnt matter. I apologize bhaktos but i am sure you also will agreebthere are great people available in bjp. Even sambit patra or gvln narasimharao will do a great job. Aunty ji listen to our Manki baat

                            People making fun a this time also and taking a dig should be ashamed. You could have been on that expressway as well would you have said the same thing. Politics is one side but safety of a human being should not be joked around. I guess RAGA and Keju didn't teach his online brigade of manners. Well that is not expected from them.
