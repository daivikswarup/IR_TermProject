A team of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action or CoBRA 208 Batallion was on a search operation in the Dabbamarka jungles along with District Reserve Group personnel on Thursday when they came under attack around noon. The security personnel returned fire leading to an encounter between the two sides that continued for more than 12 hours. Among the injured is the Commandant of the Battalion PS Yadav.
The security personnel came under attack a number of times as they were trying to evacuate their injured colleagues, heading back to Kistaram approximately 15 km away from Dabbamarka.
The three commandos who were killed in action are Fateh Singh, N S Lanju and Laxman Kurti, sources said. The injured personnel were evacuated from Kistaram camp using helicopters, from where most of them have been flown to the state capital Raipur.

                            This is true face of communists. Not only here but all across the globe communist are and also were involved in civil war with their own people. From Russia, cuba, vietnam, china and india too. People like JNU student leader who support this ideology are being treated as heroes in india that too only when they are speaking against BJP as if congress is holy co.

                            For hundreds of Years Corruption Flowed from the Upper Caste and Political Caste in India overwhelming Justice and Human Rights . <br/>
About time "Justice and Human Rights Flow from the Barrel of a Gun ". Keep up the Fight for Justice. The Majority of Downtrodden Indians need it .

                            CRPF doesn't seem to have the expertise to fight Naxalites. Our numerous CAPFs are not professional enough. They need to reduce their flab, train better and improve their tactics. The Govt must reduce the numerous CAPFs, merge them, disband the ineffective ones, train them better to make them more effective. The 7th CPC recommendations of OROP for them should be rejected because they retire at the ages of 57 to 60.

                            I support the Naxals who want independence from Bharat. You people only understand one language. Pakistan should support all insurgencies in Bharat leading to a peaceful future for the subcontinent.
