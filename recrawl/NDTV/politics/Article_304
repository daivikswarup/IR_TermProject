Headline::::Vijay Mallya Tweets, 'Did Not Flee, Am An International Businessman'



DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:38:29+05:30



New Delhi:Â                             Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who faces pressure to repay nearly a billion dollars owed to banks by his collapsed airline, tweeted early this morning that he is "not an absconder" and would comply with the law.
In a series of tweets, Mr Mallya also alleged a "witch-hunt" by the media.

The 60-year-old industrialist reacted to reports that he left the country despite a warning or look-out notice to airports to stop him from flying abroad. It has emerged that the CBI had changed the nature of the lookout notice to "providing information about his travel plans".
A group of 17 banks owed enormous debt by Mr Mallya's grounded Kingfisher Airlines had asked the Supreme Court to stop him from leaving the country but the government told the court that he had left on March 2.
Mr Mallya, dubbed the "king of good times" over his extravagant lifestyle and larger-than-life persona, was granted huge loans by many state-run banks without adequate security for his Kingfisher Airlines even though it was clear the company was collapsing.
His departure, possibly to the UK, in the middle of attempts to recover the unpaid debts caused a row in Parliament yesterday, with the Congress charging the government with being a party in his "escape".

                            So Mr Mallya, from your tweet you made it look like your intentions are good. So you should also give a date by when you will clear all your debt? <br/>

                            Sounds like a plan Mr. Mallya. Come back and pay the debts and create an example. Would be a good lesson for Ambani's and Adani.

                            You don't need to abscond Mallya when law-keepers are there to protect lawmakers/lawbreakers like you. It seems you are quite sure of your clean act of sponging the financial system sans any personal obligations to repay.

                            Don't take his words for face  value. He played such gimmicks earlier too and all were found fake. Courts and central govt should quickly proceed with recovery process. Also lender banks officials too should be interrogated and arrested.

                            International Hedonist would be more apt. Few days ago, your statement was that you are going to co-operate with the investigation, and then when the proceedings were on in the court, you silently escaped. Face it if you are a MAN ; let alone the BUSINESSman. You are such a good businessman that DIAGEO paid you millions to throw you out of the Board (severance pay). Wish you did the same to Kingfisher Airlines staff.... All you care for is your Pleasures &amp; nothing else. Hope to see a red-corner notice in your name soon, and of course TIHAR is your next home.. Till then, enjoy your time in 'LADYWALK'.

                            I think the first culprit is the Banks who gave him so much of loans due to the pressure from their higher ups and politicians.. we should investigate in that way along with punishing Vijay mallays.. I see more public sector banks involved in providing the higher loans to him rather than private.. so definetly there is involvement of politicians in this and this should be probed thoroughly..more loans flown from 2004 to 2012...and every one know who was ruling..

                            Every criminal worth its salt, finds refuge in UK, the rogue country of Financial Terrorism that has taught the world the art of looting. They are the masters of thuggery. NOT EVEN a single criminal has ever been extradited from UK even by China, Japan and so what chance does India has regarding Lalit Modi and Mallya. But countries like Israel and Russia have either eliminated or kidnapped their enemies in London. The Kahalistanis, LTTE and Kashmiri terrorists were adopted and groomed here. The City of London is a sovereign state with its own laws and UK police cannot enter the square mile just like Delhi police is not allowed inside the JNU campus. This is a safe heaven for LaMo and Mallya. None other than the Present Government is to be blamed for NOT arresting the defaulter. The Nation expected Modiji would do something on Money Laundering Shell companies. Bhakts will ask why was this not done in 60 years. Yes thats why Congress faced demise. Citing examples of Anderson (Bhopal) and Quattrocchi (Bofors) is NOT what we expect. BJP made Mallya a Rajya Sabha member when they were aware of the facts that he is a defaulter. Congress allowed Lalit Modi to run even while criticising him. BJP allowed Vijay Mallya to run even when issuing look out notices. Few days after Ms Swaraj helped Lalit Modi on humanitarian grounds, he was spotted partying in another country

                            Its true. Once media trial starts, everything vanishes. He might have used and misused all the things but without giving him a chance, media made and declared him a culprit. Plz note that I am not at all a supporter on him.

                            While it is true that Mallayya must go through the law and should repay the defaults, the media projecting him as an absconder before verifying all the facts is only sending wrong signal to the world business community. India being projected as a hostile country for doing business where a business man gets convicted by the media trial even before the legal system decide on this matter is not going to help in  attracting investments.

                            All those who are shouting in the name of MAlya and Govt, if possible understand Company Law.<br/><br/>
Company wealth and Personal Wealth is totally different. If Malya earned the wealth in other Company, no one will force him to use this money in loss making company. It is upto the person.<br/><br/>
This issue cropped up because UBL paid Malya some hundred crores as final settlement for removing him from UBL Chairman. Now the point is this amount is received from UBL in instalments. Now there is no link between UBL and KA. <br/><br/>
All the Banks are in queue outside KA for giving loans because it is their business to give loan and then get the profits when banks found it is profit making. Now due to some reason this did not work out and the investment decision of bank is not correct. Now what Bank will do, confiscate all the property of KA and all Bank Accounts and then later sale in auction. That is exactly Banks are planning to do from the time KA shut its operations. But this too is not that easy. There are various processes involved in this.<br/><br/>
Malya is not a sole owner of KA. There are many parties and all are responsible for settling the loans, however Malya is having majority stakes. <br/><br/>
Company Law is meant for this purpose only, to separate the persona and his private wealth from Company property. Whatever happened in this case is not FRAUD as many people suggesting. This is technical  and many part operational failure of the company. Otherwise Malya was behing bars long before like Sahara's ROY to whom many are referring.<br/><br/>
Finally our media is very smart. They do not open the facts about the news to the people and only create environment to get the benefit. Finally people are misguided, Govt got bad name, only profit is of Media and people supporting them. Do not go by whatever said in media. Understand the subject first.

Also apart from not paying the employees salary in KF major mistake is on our administration..  In this case Banks hold major responsibility.. If Mallya has committed this  crime, These banks helped him do it.. The authorities must be punished in first place.

                            Quite ridiculous. He seems to have complied with all the applicable laws of employment for the employees of London &amp; New York offices. And he doesn't have the money to pay salaries for the KFA within the country, to which he belongs. Neither is his conduct in accordance with a law abiding citizen nor does he seem to have any intention to clear this debt. He knows that the country's judicial systems will chase him for some years and he can easily get away with it by bribing politicians, the officials supposed to upkeep the law of the land etc. Lets all see how you get hold of the businessman now ? Lalit Modi moves around and now Mallya adds to this list too.

Arun Jaitley is more bothered about countering Rahul Gandhi's statement than clearly stating an action plan. When will Modi government grow up? When will Modi government start delivering on its promise of bringing criminal offenders to book? To me, Modi is more bothered about Rahul Gandhi than governing India.

                            corruption at its peak. This helps him to flee. He is also aware that he cannot run for long. hence he made this statement. but biggest culprit are the bank who gave him loan inspite of knowing everything. I think even banks should be held more responsible than him. as a defaulter he looks for means to take money and bank officials were looking for kick backs in that
