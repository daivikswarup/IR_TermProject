Headline::::BJP's Yogi Adityanath Calls Actor Anupam Kher A 'Real-Life Villain'



DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:37:57+05:30



New Delhi: HighlightsActor Anupam Kher is a real-life villain: BJP MP Yogi Adityanath 
Kher said Adityanath should be thrown out of BJP 'for speaking nonsense'
Kher's comments came at a debate on 'intolerance' in Kolkata
                                Yogi Adityanath, BJP lawmaker from Uttar Pradesh, trended on Twitter on Wednesday morning for his spat with actor Anupam Kher, who he has called a "real-life villain".
The 43-year-old MP and temple priest known for making provocative speeches is clearly livid with Mr Kher who suggested in a speech at a Kolkata event last week that leaders like Yogi Adityanath "should be thrown out of the BJP and put behind bars".Anupam Kher was speaking in a debate on "intolerance" and made an impassioned speech in defence of the Narendra Modi government that was shared virally on social media.
Yogi Adityanath has retorted, "Anupam Kher has proved that he is a villain not only on reel but also in real life."
 

Anupam Kher, an internationally acclaimed actor, has played many roles in Bollywood films, most of them comic or dramatic. But he has also essayed some memorable negative roles like that of Dr Dang in the film 1986 film Karma.

                            Why NDTV picked up only a piece of speech? You should have written about the whole speech and his furious counterattack on the so called tolerance debate. It has been circulated on whatsapp.<br/>
People -please let the government function, make effort and do some good projects, schemes for people of India and take it to implementation. Then you have 2019 - we can all decide then who does the work. Whether it is the Jhumla party or the other. <br/><br/>
Criticism is fine but to what level needs to be thought about.
