Srinagar:Â                             National Conference (NC) working president Omar Abdullah today said his party will never enter into an alliance with the BJP, stating that he would quit politics than compromise with the honour and dignity of the state and its people.
NC would never enter into any sort of an alliance with the BJP, he said.
"I would rather quit politics than compromise with the honour and dignity of the state and its people," Mr Abdullah said addressing a public meeting in south Kashmir's Shopian district on the occasion of rejoining of Shabir Ahmed Kullay in the party.
The former chief minister alleged that PDP's "sellout" to the BJP brought with it disillusionment, disempowerment and contempt for the people of the state.
PDP entered into an alliance with those who want to "abolish our flag, destroy the foundations of our special status and patronise those who persecute people on the basis of what they eat and do not eat," he said.
In the last year, BJP has used its alliance with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir as a "certificate to disguise its politics of polarisation as that of inclusivity," Mr Abdullah said.
He said PDP has "risked" the political rights and interests of the people of the state in order to clench on to power in an embrace with the BJP while BJP and RSS leaders continue to "spew venom" against minorities and continue to "threaten them of dire consequences."
"I can never have anything to do with these people and would refuse every position of power that comes at the cost of the dignity of my people," Mr Abdullah said.
