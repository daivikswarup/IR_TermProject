Patna:Â                             JNU Students' Union president Kanhaiya Kumar is more of a 'deshbhakt' (patriot) than the BJP leaders who have dubbed him anti-national, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Friday.
Nitish Kumar made the remarks after ending a two-day visit to Nepal, and a day after Kanhaiya Kumar was released after being in jail for 20 days on sedition charges.
The Janata Dal-United leader said Kanhaiya Kumar, who is from Begusarai in Bihar, had been framed.
Nitish Kumar praised Kanhaiya Kumar's hour-long speech at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus on Thursday night in which he attacked the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raised issues of intolerance, hunger and poverty.
Nitish Kumar said the Modi government did not like the outspoken students of JNU who questioned the government's policies and raised issues that embarrassed it.
Student leaders like Kanhaiya Kumar will strengthen democracy in the country, the chief minister said.

                            For a jungle raj leader anyone like Kanhaiya will look patriot only because of anti-national activities.  Nitish should keep himself restricted to his jungle (Bihar).

                            After coming from jail Kanhaiya has forgotten the azadi of Kashmir,so he is now patriot. Hope Mr. Umar Khalid and Mr. Anirban will also forget the azadi of kashmir after coming from jail and will be patriot. Thanks Delhi police.

                            What kanhaiya Kumar did is absolutely right and if somebody support it for the right cause irrespective of which party he/ she belong, then it must be appreciated. Bjp or RSS should not decide what is nationalism or patriotism. If somebody is against the bjp or RSS then they imposed anti national template upon him/her.<br/>
What nitishji had done to bihar, everybody knows. I personally appreciate him.
