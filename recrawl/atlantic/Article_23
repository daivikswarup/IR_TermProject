The Republican Party's Best Bet Against Trump


More by necessity than design, some of the leading Republicans opposed to Donald Trump are completely reversing their thinking about how he might be stopped after his sweeping wins on Super Tuesday.How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceAfter Trump’s victories in seven of 11 states this week, some of his key Republican critics are moving from a long-shot bet on beating him through consolidation to an even riskier wager on denying him the nomination through fragmentation.Before Tuesday, Republican leaders had almost universally bet on consolidation: clearing the field to unite behind one alternative to the front-runner. But after Trump captured states across the GOP’s geographic and demographic spectrum, those resisting him are now talking about a strategy of fragmentation: encouraging Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich, Trump’s principal remaining rivals, to informally divide the country and simultaneously challenge him on different battlefields.The goal is to splinter the vote enough to prevent Trump from acquiring the 1,237 delegates he needs for a first ballot nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland.  “I don’t think consolidation is the path forward; I think that was a December option,” says Stuart Stevens, the senior strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012 and a leading Trump critic. “I think people other than Donald Trump winning delegates is the answer, and that is better achieved not through consolidation.”Katie Packer Gage, the executive director of Our Principles PAC, the leading conservative group targeting Trump, has now also concluded that fragmentation offers a better chance of stopping him than consolidation, if only because the latter is so unlikely. “Whatever [is] the best option might be irrelevant,” she says. “That might be the only option. There probably does have to be a multi-pronged effort to deny him the nomination.”It would be tempting to call this a strategy of divide and conquer-except that would understate the position of weakness from which this discussion springs. “I would call it divide and survive,” Stevens says. “No one is going to be conquering.”Among Republicans nervous about Trump, the talk of consolidation hasn’t stopped. But nothing about Tuesday’s results encouraged it. Instead it underscored the limits confronting each of the candidates chasing Trump, even as it demonstrated both the front-runner’s strengths and continuing challenges.In most respects, Trump’s performance this week was dominant. Trump crossed the geographic and religious divide that stymied the past two GOP nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, by winning northern and border states with relatively fewer evangelicals that they carried (Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia) but also taking the heavily evangelical Southern states they lost (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee). And Trump continued to demonstrate enormous appeal for the party’s turbulent blue-collar wing, carrying at least 46 percent of non-college whites in Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Massachusetts.But in other ways, Trump’s performance hinted at lingering resistance. He exceeded 40 percent of the vote in just two states—Alabama and Massachusetts. In every state, his showing among whites with a four-year college degree or more lagged behind his support from whites without degrees; he’s carried most college-educated whites in only six of the 13 states with exit polls. And of course, his wins came even as concern over him among party leaders peaked following his refusal to instantly denounce the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist David Duke on CNN last weekend. “You talk to people on Capitol Hill and they are terrified,” the veteran Republican strategist Pete Wehner said.The problem remains, though, that none of Trump’s rivals appear big enough to stop him alone. Cruz and Rubio continue to demonstrate mirror-image weaknesses. Cruz’s coalition is too narrow, while Rubio’s remains too shallow. Even as Trump has cracked Cruz’s evangelical foundation in several states, the Texan has not topped 18 percent support among voters who are not evangelicals anywhere except his home state. Rubio, meanwhile, has drawn support that is broad but thin. On Tuesday, Rubio won white college graduates in just three states and non-college whites in none. And by tilting right in his message, Rubio has left room for Kasich—whose support is narrowly restricted to party centrists—to peel away moderates outside the South.Looking at that record, it’s no wonder more Trump critics are losing faith that one candidate can unite the party against him—and instead hoping that the field can collectively contest Trump in enough states to prevent him from obtaining a first ballot nomination. The most obvious risk in this approach is that the pack will divide the voters most skeptical of Trump. But, argues Stevens, “There is no other path. Ask yourself: If Rubio gets out is Kasich going to win Florida? If Kasich gets out, is Rubio going to win Ohio?” Even some senior advisers to the remaining contenders are privately echoing that logic.This last ditch strategy implicitly acknowledges that Trump is likely to arrive in Cleveland with the largest delegate haul—but bets that the convention will reject him anyway if he falls below an absolute majority. Ordinarily that would be a recipe for civil war. But Trump’s critics justifiably think civil war is equally likely if he’s nominated. “There is a huge split in the party whether he wins or there is a brokered convention,” said Gage. “Neither,” she added a moment later, “bodes well for winning the general election.”


Xenophon::Thursday, March 3, 2016 5:35 PM::<comment>This isn't about policy though, not to the plurality of R primary voters who are voting for trump this time around. It's all about perception, and its about who holds the power. </comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:00 PM::<comment>It's not policy, it's not Ideology, it's personal. The base wants to wipe out the Party Bosses. And Trump volunteered for the job. Just the other day, saw a CNN poll that showed 78% of Trump supporters are locked in. They're storming into Cleveland like if it's the Bastille. You can't appease people who want  you dead, as Dubya would put it. All there is left for them is going down fighting.</comment>

Eupseiphos::Friday, March 4, 2016 6:38 AM::<comment>Obama is WAY left and nothing like Ike. Eisenhower did not think the US was primarily a force for evil in the world and needed to be taken down a notch. And he certainly had room in the WH for a bust of Churchill. And he did not repeatedly get slammed down by the courts for trying to skirt the Constitution with his pen and his phone. And he did not view the country through a lens that sees only what group a person belongs to before making judgments about them.</comment>

iggipop::Friday, March 4, 2016 9:10 AM::<comment>Ike warned of the Military Industrial Complex and investigated national health care plans. That sounds Liberal based on today's shift to the Right</comment>

A. Jamie Saris::Friday, March 4, 2016 7:38 PM::<comment>Lord, really?The top tax rate under Ike was 90%. He invested in an infrastructural program that rivaled the New Deal, and he also supported massive government investment in human capital (GI Bill). He imagined that a society that was opening universities was better than one building private prisons, and he was prescient enough to see where the witches brew of anti-communist hysteria and ballooning crony-capitalist "defense" budgets were heading, and he warned against this trend. If Obama attempted to institute anything like Ike's policies, he would be called way more than a socialist by the entire GOP and their associated "press". This is because the modern GOP is a revenant of the Birchers (who in fact suggested that Ike was a "Red Agent").Btw, Churchill was dumped (decisively and immediately) by the British electorate after the war. He had to write his own (very lengthy) press release to establish the cult that now worships him, which is pretty much confined to bookish Tories and not-so-bookish right-wing Americans.</comment>

Are you capable of understanding that the elites use MSM reporters?Are you capable of understanding that those reporters do things like set the boundaries of acceptable discourse?Are you capable of understanding that those reporters attempt to punish those who violate those boundaries of acceptable discourse? So, for instance, some part of the GOP base might hold "unacceptable" views such as Obama being Muslim. When any politician gives such views the time of day, the MSM uses it to make the politician back off and they do.Are you capable of understanding that that's a "mind war", in that the elites are using their brains to tamp down the GOP base?I realize I used some big words above, but with the help of online dictionaries and smart friends you might be able to understand them.

If you think that the estate tax will effect the rich no they can afford to use the system to avoid taxes. The estate tax is totally devastating to a small privately held company that has grown to where it is over the threshold for the estate tax . Because the xompany'y assets are not in cash but stuff it must be sold or liquidated to satisfy thx tax . By the way it is not the government's money. This is the people who are truly hit the hardest with this tax . Remember that small business creates 66% of all jobs in America . When the government picks on it you willNEVER get the economic recovery that we all want. Also I this is just one reason for the rise of Trump.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:01 PM::<comment>So if i read Brownstein correctly, now the strategy is to destroy the GOP to stop Trump from destroying the GOP ? Hmm...wonder how that is going to work ?</comment>

MZale::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:16 PM::<comment>That idea's been kicked around for a while.  A brokered convention resulting in the nomination of a candidate other that Trump (keep in mind, it doesn't even need to be anyone who's been a candidate yet) will not destroy the party, merely create acrimony for a period of time.  This acrimony will be coming primarily from those who have not really helped the party achieve the electoral success it has had, so, the thinking goes, to hell with 'em and their bandwagon.This approach, however, permits the greatest amount of control over State and Congressional elections - events where the Republican Party has made astounding gains in the past several years.  A Trump candidacy, on the other hand, completely distorts the equation in these other elections, and losing the gains is an amazingly high price to pay - especially for those who have worked so hard for them.A basic concept underlying this analysis, it's worth noting, is that Trump voters are easily distracted by shiny objects, so they'll get over it soon enough after November.  After all, it's not like Hillary Clinton is ideologically far left of the majority of Republicans holding national office.  Her election would also give them something to immediately start running against.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:28 PM::<comment>I think it's way too late for that. Just two years ago, Rubio was hailed as a Tea Party darling, and Cruz was the outsider. The base just wants the Bosses gone. The appeasing strategy might work on the Dems--this time ! But you can only fool everybody for some time. If Romney really wants to hurt Trump, the only way he can do that, is by endorsing him with passion. The Base' stance right now is "scorched earth". Besides, even if the Black Swan really happens, i have no doubt Trump will be on the ballot , either as the GOP nominee, or as a third-party candidate.</comment>

MZale::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:52 PM::<comment>Forget about Rubio or Cruz.  They only have value in together keeping Trump from amassing a first ballot majority at the convention.  After that, the names will fly - Perry, Walker, Hutchinson, etc. even Boehner or Ryan might make a play.Your statement that the "base just wants the Bosses gone" correctly paraphrases their words, but also highlights their ignorance.  They are doing nothing whatsoever to get rid of them.  A Trump nomination does not remove them - it's just a middle finger raised in their direction.  It's not like Trump is arguing for term limits, campaign finance reform, automatic voter registration, changes to gerrymandering laws, etc.More importantly, after, at most, eight years, Trump is gone.  The recession he's triggered is still underway, McConnell et al. still hold their positions, and the "establishment" sits in the catbird seat surrounded by "I told you so" news clippings.Edit:  I'll add, to your final statement, a third party candidate is actually quite likely - even if Trump wins the Red nomination.  I've seen rumblings about running a conservative candidate to split the vote, letting Hillary move to 1600 Pennsylvania, while maximizing turnout for down ballot candidates.  Most voters are looking at this as only the presidential race.  The Republican leaders are trying to best play the entire election.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:03 PM::<comment>I agree, only Sanders is adressing the issue in a concerted way , but with less "boots on the ground" . Trump does has lots of troops, but no generals to wage a campaign. BUT a Trump Presidency could very well be THE LAST Presidency. Trump reminds me of Julius Ceasar, born with a silver spoon, "Champion of the People", who went on to become Consul over the heads of the Senate, then Dictator, then Dictator for Life, while the crowd cheered. Study the Roman Republic, and you'll find more similarities than diferences.</comment>

MZale::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:14 PM::<comment>The Sanders -Trump comparisons are interesting.  They show just how skilled a politician Clinton is, and how much of the campaign occurs before formal announcements are made.  Clinton pretty much set things up perfectly for herself over the past two years.Trump, on the other hand, waded into a wide open primary scenario.  Hell, that may be why he finally got into a race.  So long as he maintained a core of GOP orthodoxy in what issues he chose to address, his chances were as good as anyone's.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:22 PM::<comment>My guess, Trump decided to run when Cantor lost his seat. If not even Cantor is safe, the Party is there for the taking. It's a sort of non-verbal agreement between him and the base. Of course, the base is deluded, but a party that gave the World Sarah Palin , Michelle Bachmann et al, what can you do, right ? On the Dems, think the insurgency will be squashed, but will come back, way stronger , in 2020. And i'm pinning my hopes on Tulsi. That girl has got that "je ne sais quoi".</comment>

I'm afraid a whole lot of Americans share that view. I think you are confused as to who these people are. Trump gets the most support (in terms of both polling and individual donations) in Rust Belt states & inland CA. They are blue collar workers who have been displaced by both globalization and illegal immigration at the same time. One Iowa supporter talked about how his job used to pay $38/hr and now illegal immigrants are paid $10/hr to work in the plant. If you don't empathize with those people's plight, quite frankly you are an ass oleAnd these people are DEMOCRATS who were abandoned by the Democrats. They are not the GOP base. They could care less about "small government" or capital gains taxes, or abortion or religious freedom. Try reading a bit. There have been dozens of pieces about union members who are crossing the line to vote for Trump instead of the union supported Clinton. Why did you think that turnout for Democrats is down from 2008 by the same number of voters it is up for Republican primaries?</comment>

Formerly_Marcella::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:39 PM::<comment>What you're saying makes sense - which is why it's wrong in this case. These voters are not driven by logic or picking the sensible candidate from their party to beat the Democratic nominee. This argument made sense last fall back when everyone thought this man's candidacy was a joke and that he'd never win a primary or a caucus.A brokered convention that names a nominee other than Trump will result in the end of the GOP. Trump's voters won't fall in line behind the new nominee -- they'll just stay home, pushing the party further into irrelevancy and cementing blue ticket wins across the board. In their minds, a Republican establishment candidate is just as bad as Hillary Clinton -- and doesn't deserve their vote.They may or may not be distracted by shiny objects but they're feeling cornered and desperate ... that is something they won't get over. This is pure emotion for them. And let's be honest ... there's a more than likely chance that Trump will just migrate to being a 3rd party candidate - he has the money and the infrastructure AND the votes. His people would just follow him there.</comment>

MZale::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:54 PM::<comment>"Trump will just migrate to being a 3rd party candidate - he has the money and the infrastructure AND the votes.

bdphd::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:06 AM::<comment>I think this down-ballot analysis on the part of the Republican establishment is mistaken. Much like their underestimate of Trump, they're assuming that there's a core group of establishment voters that will be happy to come out and support them, but a race with Trump as nominee or third-party candidate, an establishment conservative, and Hillary is basically going to be a civil war on the conservative side that will energize Trump supporters (along with a lot of blue-collar Dems) and depress establishment types (because they have no hope of winning the Presidential). I'd imagine Trump comes in second and the establishment conservative comes in third, and then the future of the GOP itself as constituted for the past 75 years is up in the air.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Friday, March 4, 2016 6:06 AM::<comment>Not a stretch, just hyperbole , to get a point across. The Coalition upon the GOP has relied since Reagan, later Dubya is in Civil War. From my chair, your solution will give the US a solid 20 years of monolitic Dems . If the Status Quo comes up with huge concessions to the insurgents, that might speed the process, but that implies having a "purist" insurgency, for the duration. The Party has drifted so far to the Right, it now has hit the Wall. The better solution is to come back to the Center. Fast. Erase everything, and go back to Eisenhower.</comment>

jonathanpulliam::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:24 PM::<comment>Any legal ambiguity may be subject to judicial review, rest assured.  West Virginia voters are for Trump something like 57%.  But the vote that most affected WV recently was the 5-4 vote to defend coal industry in power generation in which Justice Scalia was the deciding vote.  I don't think West Virginia voters are keen to have the federal government tell them they can't be allowed to have their principal industry.  They will be voting Trump in November.  Here in Massachusetts, 20,000 Democrats left their party just so they could register Republican and vote for Trump.  If Trump is the Republican nominee, he has better than a 97% chance of winning in the general election.</comment>

Doug Earl::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:31 PM::<comment>Wonder would it make a diff if Cruz and Rubio flipped a coin, winner runs for president and the loser is his running mate, announced immediately.  Would the Cruz-Rubio vote coalesce, would they gather the votes of the marginal candidates and would it be enough to beat Trump?</comment>

T-Vega::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:25 PM::<comment>Realistically it would have to be Rubio-Cruz. Trump terrifies the beltway, but the beltway hates Cruz with a passion, so ditching Trump for Cruz is a pyrrhic victory at best. Cruz’s style and temperament is also less appealing than Rubio’s in terms of a general election, IMHO, even though he’s not that much further to the right on the issues. Having Cruz as VP would likely allay these issues and still appease his base (and donors), and would set him up nicely for 2020 should Hillary win the general, or 2024 if the GOP does.</comment>

John Ingram::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:43 PM::<comment>Trump supporters are so angry with the current president that they will actually ensure he has a third term by way of Hillary by nominating Donald Trump. That is just plain dumb.When the courts at all levels turn democrat, the senate is in democrat hands, the president is democrat once again, and possibly the house of representatives becomes majority democrat this election or the next; tell us where all of the mindless anger got this country and you. Only emotional impulse driven morons could ruin this chance to win what should be an easy election by nominating a carnival barker to be their candidate.I think Trump supporters are the type who pine for the days of the pre-1970's when federal, state, and local governments looked the other way when xenophobic zealots were running around like animals assaulting and killing immigrants and people of other groups who were actual American citizens. They can live it out through Trump via his rhetoric.That is why they vote for him even though they themselves say he is the least likely to win. Talk about crazy. This reminds me of the people who joined the Confederacy. Mindless xenophobes.</comment>

Ktom::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:29 PM::<comment>This is the beginning of the end for the GOP... they created an atmosphere of fear and anger, and they now have lost control over the result. No one can be blamed for this movement embodied by Trump other than the GOP leadership and the money that is supporting it. There has been much talk about how stupid/naive/hillybilly Trump's supporters are, but in a way they have finally woken up to the fact that they have been misled by the GOP for years into thinking that the party has their best interests at heart. The GOP has been dangling xenophobia in front of them to appeal to their base interests, and pulling a "bait-and-switch" to cut government spending on the poor and lower taxes on the rich, both which actually hurt the lower income/less educated whites that form the base of Trump's support. It is little wonder these people are angry, it is little wonder they are now anti-GOP, and there is little chance they will forgive and forget. Demographics were already working against the GOP, but now the end will be brought forward by this self-inflicted implosion. Good riddance to the peddlers of fear and loathing.</comment>

T-Vega::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:32 PM::<comment>The funny - and scary - thing is that based on their record of obstructionism in Congress, the GOP candidate with the least amount of experience in government (Trump) is the candidate who would probably get the most done and best keep the social contract intact. Of course, he’ll piss off the entire world and half the US doing it, but that’s more a reflection on the GOP than anything else: their only candidate who won’t destroy the government and/or sell it out to mega donors and shows a modicum of concern for the poor is also the most bigoted, demagogic, and uncivil person to run for president in probably half a century.</comment>

Or are they banking on them simply "falling in line" and supporting the Republican nominee no matter what? Because truthfully, I don't see that happening.These people are having a very emotional moment driven by fear. Fear of losing their way of life, fear of not being heard, fear of being displaced. And ignoring their primary votes to give the nomination to someone else will LITERALLY fulfill all those fears - ones that have been stoked by GOP politicians and right leaning media for about a decade now.This is quite a corner for the GOP to have painted themselves into. My guess is that to the average Trump supporter ... an establishment Republican candidate is just as bad as Hillary Clinton. Which will mean quite a few of them will stay home in November if this becomes a reality.</comment>

Tulse::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:38 PM::<comment>So how is this plan supposed to even work?  Are Cruz and Kasich supposed to somehow drop out of Florida, and Rubio and Cruz drop out of Ohio?  At least with those states its clear who "should" win, but what about all the other contests?  How do they divide those up?  And can one even get one's name off of a state ballot at this point?This just seems a bit absurd.</comment>

Rururr_Jururr::Thursday, March 3, 2016 11:16 PM::<comment>It's the opposite: Keep Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich in the race right up until the convention.  The idea is that, should one of them drop out, not all of their voters will move to another anyone-but-Trump candidate, letting Trump win primaries with a greater margin and more delegates.Convention delegates are only bound by the primaries on the first convention ballot.  If Donald Trump gets less than 1,237 delegates committed through the primaries, then there will be more than one ballot.  At that point his campaign would be over, because the party leaders have a lot more control over a divided convention than over the primary process.  The only effect they can have on the primary is to run campaigns that deny him a majority of pledged delegates, and the only way they can do that is with multiple candidates.And yes, this is all very absurd.  But that was predestined as soon as Trump's campaign survived insulting McCain's Navy service, at which point it became obvious that he could stay in for a long while.</comment>

Tulse::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:07 AM::<comment>But he is more likely to get a majority of delegates if the field stays divided, as so many of the upcoming states are winner-take-all.  That's what doesn't make sense to me about the proposed scheme -- I don't think the math works.</comment>

Rururr_Jururr::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:11 AM::<comment>That's how desperate, flailing schemes work: They rely heavily on assumptions, like the Republican assumption that they can stop Florida and/or Ohio from going to Trump.</comment>

Czev::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:25 AM::<comment>You have a point. But as the article states, it's the ONLY option. Leaving a single establishment candidate would virtually assure that either Ohio or Florida is lost (depending on whether rubio or kasich remain), whereas if they both remain, there is at least a chance that through attack ads, rubio can win florida, and/or kasich win Ohio,  depriving Trump of key delegates. The odds are long, but they are longer if only one remains. This is kind of like an onside kick!</comment>

Delenda Est::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:42 PM::<comment>It is evident this is no longer about winning the Presidential election. This is a struggle for control of the GOP, which is the real objective, and worth sacrificing the election to win.</comment>

Tim_Sims::Thursday, March 3, 2016 11:27 PM::<comment>Stupid.  If Trump wins the most states and has the most delegates, and the party hands the nomination to some one else, their nominee is going to face a record breaking, humiliating defeat in the general election.It doesn't matter that the rules allow it.  It matters that the "establishment" is going to be seen as blatantly denying the base its first choice because he's not friendly to the establishment.Trump WILL run as an independent, and he will wind up easily with enough votes to torpedo Cruz or Rubio or Kasich, whoever gets the eventual nod.</comment>

Captain Nitpick::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:01 AM::<comment>Agreed.  Their only hope of stopping Trump is that a substantial number of current Trump supporters are somehow persuaded by the additional truckloads of attacks being released.I thought the 2012 GOP primary process was interesting with several candidates taking turns as flavor-of-the-month.  My assumption was that the spotlight shone on the frontrunner also lit up that candidates warts, causing people to reconsider their support.  For whatever reason, people seem to love Trump, warts and all.</comment>

freeoscar::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:05 AM::<comment>If Trump can't win the nomination under the rules he was aware of when he entered, and pouts about it, he's a pathetic loser.  He rightly points out how pathetic it is that no Congressional colleagues of Cruz support him - if Trump can't build enough alliances to get him from 40% of the delegates to 51% that's on him.  Being in opposition to Clinton for 4 years and maintaining a party which hasn't been commandeered by racists is a small price to pay.</comment>

Tim_Sims::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:29 AM::<comment>If Trump gets 40% and the next candidate only gets 30% or 25%, and that makes Trump a loser, then what does it make that candidate?If 40% isn't good enough, then why is 30% good enough?But really, that's not even the issue.  The real issue is, how does the establishment possibly tell a group that is voting largely as a middle finger of protest against the establishment, to simply fall in line and accept a candidate who has less popular support than Trump?   Why should all the "littles" simply fall in line and accept the candidate that the elites tell them to accept, when the elites won't accept the candidate who has the most support?   If the party insiders care about the party so much, if they expect the radicals to stay quiet for the sake of the party, then why don't the insiders take their own medicine and fall in line?The message is pretty clear here:  the GOP elites, the "Establishment" have utter contempt for their own base.  They have contempt for the idea that a bunch of blue collar, uneducated people can collectively have more of a say than a narrow band of rich, highly educated insiders.   Which is exactly WHY so many of these folks will support a clown like Trump in the first place.  Because hey, he might be a liar, but at least he's THEIR liar.  At least he doesn't act disgusted by their support.  If nothing else, at least he SAYS he likes the blue collar party base.Even if you consider Trump supporters to be stupid (and trust me, I've seen plenty here and elsewhere who fit the bill), they're not so stupid that they can't see that the party's elites are going to try to walk all over them, even when they have no sane argument for doing so.That's what these insiders don't get.  They thought after Romney lost, that they could just apply a fresh coat of spin to the old lies and make progress, that they could phase in hispanic votes while phasing out the fading old blue collar white voters, some how without any one noticing what they were doing.No, it's not going to work that way.  It's going to be ugly, like any break up is ugly, and the more that the GOP insiders try to avoid it, the more that they try to spin it and control it and rebel against it, the longer it's going to take and the more divisive it's going to be.</comment>

But there's no way to do that, and there is no single one of the remaining three that is strong enough to take Trump on across all the remaining states.So yeah, screwed.</comment>

He makes great deals because he's got either money or bankruptcy court as leverage. When he's trying to sound presidential, that's when he's acting.  Frankly, I don't think he's a good enough actor to maintain that persona for any extended period of time.</comment>

Plan 17::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:49 AM::<comment>I have no idea if he makes great deals, and neither do the majority of his supporters who characterize him as a "great" businessman. All I know is that he was born very rich and is still very rich, 70 years later. As he once testified, how rich he'll say he is depends as much on his mood as any tangible estimate of how much money he has. He is a great self-promoter, but that's a different thing entirely.</comment>

My bigger issue is with the notion that being a good businessman makes a person likely to be a good president, but I suspect that the majority of his supporters think he is a great businessman simply because he plays one on tv.

It works on both sides too. Look at how many liberals regard Warren Buffett as some sort of benevolent demi-God. They might feel differently if they were sitting across a negotiating table from Warren Buffett and his army of lawyers.</comment>

Like most people born on third base, he thinks he's hit a triple.  It's easy to confuse being born into power with being powerful.  His personality is what it is because of his life experience.  He isn't going to adapt it to the change in circumstance that would be involved with being president.</comment>
