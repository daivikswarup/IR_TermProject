The Violence to Come


What will happen to American politics if, as now appears likely, the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump? Here’s one bet: It will get more violent.The United States is headed toward a confrontation, the likes of which it has not seen since 1968, between leftist activists, who believe in physical disruption as a means of drawing attention to injustice, and a candidate eager to forcibly put down that disruption in order to make himself look tough. The new culture of physical disruption on the activist left stems partly from disillusionment with Barack Obama. In 2008, Obama’s election sparked unprecedented excitement among young progressives. But that excitement was followed by deep disillusionment as it became clear that even a liberal black president could not remedy the structural injustices afflicting people of color.The Convention the GOP Doesn't WantSo Millennial activists began challenging politicians directly. In June 2012, two protesters connected with the National Immigrant Youth Alliance occupied the Obama campaign’s Denver office for six days and threatened further takeovers unless the president stopped deporting the young undocumented immigrants dubbed “Dreamers.” Two months later, activists for undocumented immigrants sought to disrupt the Democratic convention in Charlotte.           A year later, the Black Lives Matter movement was born in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin. In 2014, Black Lives Matter leaders began to organize protests after a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, shot and killed Michael Brown. And last summer, in an effort to force presidential candidates to address police violence and mass incarceration, Black Lives Matter activists began disrupting candidates’ events.After some initial hesitation and defensiveness, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, and Hillary Clinton reacted to these disruptions by meeting with activists and embracing much of their agenda. Most Republican candidates ignored the protests as best they could.        But Donald Trump saw them as an opportunity. Asked last August about a Bernie Sanders event in which Black Lives Matters protesters spoke at length from the stage, Trump called the senator from Vermont’s response “disgusting.” He added: “That will never happen with me! I don’t know if I’ll do the fighting myself or other people will, but that was a disgrace. I felt badly for him. But it showed that he was weak. Believe me, that’s not going to happen to Trump.”It’s no coincidence that Trump raised the specter of violence. The Black Lives Matter disruptions had been peaceful. But as Trump’s campaign took off in the summer and fall of last year, he began depicting entire categories of overwhelmingly peaceful people as a physical threat. Undocumented Mexican immigrants were potential “rapists.” Syrian refugees were “strong, powerful men” who might be a “trojan horse” for ISIS.           Trump’s supporters exhibit high levels of what political scientists call “authoritarianism.” Authoritarians are unusually fearful of disorder and favor simple, brutal methods of quashing it. As Amanda Taub has noted, “When many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly.” So by fanning popular fears of chaos, especially violent chaos, Trump wins yet more votes.He does this, in part, by turning his treatment of the activists who seek to disrupt his events into a parable for how he would restore order in society at large. At a rally in Atlanta last November, an African American man began chanting, “Black Lives Matter.” According to various reports, Trump supporters responded by punching and kicking him while yelling racial slurs. Meanwhile, from the podium, Trump contrasted his response with that of Sanders’s. “You see,” Trump declared, “he was politically correct … I promise you, that’s not going to happen with me. I promise you. Never going to happen. Not going to happen. Can’t let that stuff happen.” Later on Fox News, Trump declared that, “Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.”In January, when protesters tried to disrupt a Trump rally in Vermont, Trump instructed security guards to “Get him out of here … Don't give him his coat, keep his coat. Confiscate his coat. You know, it’s about 10 degrees below zero outside.” As security dragged a protester from a Nevada rally in February, Trump declared: “You know what I hate? There’s a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches, we’re not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher.” Reporters found no evidence that the protester had, in fact, punched anyone.In mentioning the “old days,” Trump was likely referring to the 1960s. Back then, another generation of young leftists disillusioned with the failure of liberal presidents to undo systemic justice tried to physically disrupt political events, most famously at the Democratic Convention in 1968. And back then, another presidential candidate, Alabama Governor George Wallace, also turned protesters into props for an audience hungry to see order restored—if necessary by force. In 1967, anti-Vietnam protesters laid down in front of President Lyndon Johnson’s car. In 1968, in speech after speech, Wallace roused crowds by saying, falsely, that the “protesters had threatened his [Johnson’s] personal safety,” but if “some of them lie down in front of my automobile, it will be the last one they’ll ever want to lie down in front of.”“The confrontation with the hecklers became a highly stylized feature of every Wallace rally,” writes Lloyd Rohler in his book George Wallace: Conservative Populist. “Violence seemed always to be lurking in the background and it frequently burst forth.” At a Wallace rally on October 29 in Detroit, reported the Chicago Tribune, “wild, chair-swinging violence erupted” as “Wallace supporters and some of several thousand hecklers clashed, first with fists and then with folding chairs … Wallace supporters struck handcuffed hecklers as they were being led away by police, who did not interfere.”The police are more professional today than they were back then. And video-recording devices are now ubiquitous, which may make such incidents less likely. Then again, Wallace never won a major party’s nomination. Between now and November, Trump could hold hundreds more rallies, many in areas with large African American and Latino populations, in an atmosphere of mounting hysteria as Election Day nears. The young left-wing militants who have already braved danger in places like Ferguson, and who hold their more conflict-averse elders in contempt, are unlikely to stop their disruptions. Trump will keep baiting and threatening them because it’s how he rouses his fans.How will Americans react if something truly terrible happens? Given the events of recent months, it’s impossible to know.

UponFurtherReview::Monday, March 7, 2016 2:41 AM::<comment>And author Peter Beinart has to know how hypocritical he sounds when he casually mentions "leftist activists, who believe in physical disruption as a means of drawing attention to injustice" ... and then attempts to get his readers up in arms over the fact that Trump has the audacity to call for the removal of a protester who's disrupting his speech.So, Peter, it's OK to be physical when you're protesting ... just not OK to be physical when you're having the disruptive protester removed? Got it. </comment>

eYeDEF::Monday, March 7, 2016 3:26 AM::<comment>Beinart did point out that the protesters have been largely peaceful, unlike the often violent removal of those protesters from Trump rallies.</comment>

UponFurtherReview::Monday, March 7, 2016 3:54 AM::<comment>Where does Beinart say the protesters were removed violently? All I see are Trump quotes about not giving a guy his coat back and what would have happened to the protester in the old days.But I don't see anything about violence actually occurring at a Trump rally. And if mere talk equaled violence, then President Obama would be just as guilty for saying about Republicans, “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.”In any case, I have no sympathy for protesters (or authors such as Beinart) who embrace the tactics of "physical disruption" and then want to complain about physical responses at the events they disrupt.If you genuinely fear physical violence, try being less physically disruptive in your protests.</comment>

The Halversons::Monday, March 7, 2016 11:07 PM::<comment>"The violent removals" are all on video these days. None that I have seen could be stretched to the level of "violence".  Pushing and shoving and arm pulling is pretty tame.  Shootings, subway slashings, the knock out game, gangs of thugs attacking individuals and hospitalizing them, women groped or even raped in crowds.... Now THAT my friend is real "violence". Get real.</comment>

UponFurtherReview::Tuesday, March 8, 2016 7:55 AM::<comment>Yeah, professor Melissa Click certainly did her leftist cause proud when she tried to incite physical action against a student journalist who was just trying to do his job.Thankfully, the University of Missouri administration saw fit to kick her to the curb -- a rather obvious move for a school that's supposed to be one of America's greatest bastions of journalism -- but that's undermined by the fact that more than 100 fellow professors signed a letter supporting the Clickster in her battle to retain her job.</comment>

DiogenesDespairs::Sunday, March 6, 2016 10:40 PM::<comment>So, we're supposed to applaud left-wing disruptors interfering with peaceful meetings and the right of everyone else there to assemble and speak and hear, and we're supposed to condemn as "authoritarian" the efforts to restore not just order but simple civility? And this is supposed to be because we're opposed to violence? By in effect condoning disruption and therefore rewarding the disruptors because they then get what they want  - suppressing others' speech and actions?This guy is nuts, but not because he believes this drivel. He is clearly rational enough to see the total illogic involved and does not believe it. He is nuts because he thinks it might persuade anyone who is not already a left-wing extremist like he has shown himself to be, and because he only discredits himself. His hope is probably that people are too stupid to see through his sophistry. If so, he should confine himself to writing for victims of Downs Syndrome; that's more his speed.And The Atlantic is nuts too, if it is publishing this nonsense as a straight article and not an example of self-parody, because then The Atlantic is acting to discredit itself.</comment>

MoreFreedom2::Sunday, March 6, 2016 11:59 PM::<comment>Both Clinton and Trump have hecklers forcibly removed by the police from their events.  That is force used against individuals, but so is everything else government does.   Which isn't different from those that would disrupt those who arrange for and purchase a hall/podium for a speech.It is our current establishment that made it a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison for disrupting a speech: http://www.slate.com/articles/...Beinart is right, whether Trump or Hillary is elected, expect more government (read more violence) is to come.  But not just at political speeches.  It will also be the violence of taking more of your money.</comment>

UponFurtherReview::Monday, March 7, 2016 2:38 AM::<comment>I'm the last person who would defend more government, but what exactly is wrong with having hecklers removed from a speech you're trying to give to tens of thousands of spectators?I have no problem with a person standing on public property, perhaps on the sidewalk outside the arena, and holding up a sign, chanting "Black Lives Matter," "Down With Trump" or whatever.But it's not a First Amendment right to enter a private facility and scream loudly while 99.9% of the audience is trying to hear the speaker.</comment>

eYeDEF::Monday, March 7, 2016 3:30 AM::<comment>Have you seen how the crowd piles on and beats on these people that are being removed? How is that justified?It's not that they're being removed for their disruption. They should rightfully be removed. It's that Trump appears to encourage violence against these people. There's a right way to have them removed, by having security escort these people out, and there's a wrong way, which is encouraging the crowd to beat those protesters on the way out. Trump incites the wrong way of doing it.</comment>

UponFurtherReview::Monday, March 7, 2016 3:42 AM::<comment>I haven't seen anyone actually beating protesters, no.Seriously, do you have any link to a video of a Trump crowd conducting an actual beatdown of a protester? If so, share.</comment>

eYeDEF::Monday, March 7, 2016 4:24 AM::<comment>Dude this has happened so often and with enough regularity it's hard to understand how anyone following this stuff could not be aware of the violent treatment of the protesters by the mob.

UponFurtherReview::Monday, March 7, 2016 1:56 PM::<comment>Oh, please ... that's all you've got?Nobody's getting kicked or punched in that first link -- a guy is on the floor, and a lot of other guys are standing around him. The only person with a fist raised is the protester himself as he rises from the floor.And the HuffPo headline that claims that a protester was "violently" dragged out of a Trump rally is classic overkill. So what if he was removed from the event -- he was obviously there to disrupt it in the first place, so he had to have anticipated getting tossed. And in the video, I don't see him getting kicked or punched ... in fact, it's shot at such close range that there's no way to tell what exactly happened before he wound up on the floor.Tell me this: Has anyone actually been arrested for attacking any of the protesters? If not, then what does that tell you?</comment>

eYeDEF::Monday, March 7, 2016 2:53 PM::<comment>Except that's how it was widely reported by reporters at the event in the press. Were they all lying?</comment>

Attila Iskander::Monday, March 7, 2016 3:39 PM::<comment>Well.Considering that most are not much different from the author of this lying screed, most likely they were "improving" on the facts to make their report more marketable.</comment>

The Halversons::Monday, March 7, 2016 11:28 PM::<comment>You ask that as a serious question when you demonstrate that you do not know what REAL violence is when it's right in your face? This author also throws out the "violence" word with ease.  The cops in Birmingham and Chicago beating down the protestors of the day were "violent" for sure, excessively so. People who have broken the law by disrupting a public assembly and resisting removal/arrest should expect an escalation in the use of force required to make them comply with legal authorities. Everything else is whining with an agenda to smear a target like Trump.</comment>

eYeDEF::Tuesday, March 8, 2016 5:00 PM::<comment>We have a difference of opinion then because I didn't see anyone resisting arrest. There was no justification for escalation.</comment>

UponFurtherReview::Tuesday, March 8, 2016 7:49 AM::<comment>Well, lots of reporters claimed that Michael Brown said, "Hands up, don't shoot" -- and they were all lying. So who knows?What I can say for sure is that (1) I don't see anybody kicking or punching the protester in the CNN video -- but I see the protester standing up and raising his fist; and (2) if the "violence" against the protester was so egregious and unwarranted, why hasn't anybody been arrested for it?</comment>

The Halversons::Monday, March 7, 2016 11:20 PM::<comment>Dude... your using the cupcake definition of violence. Shootings, subway slashings, the knock out game, gang attacks and beatings of individuals, crowd gropings/rapes, terrorist bombings and mass murders.... THESE things are REAL violence. Now run along to your safe zone...</comment>

I was in high school at the very beginning of the current social experiment that produced easily outraged adults.  I saw things change and the result of those changes is quite apparent.  We've produced a generation of bigots who don't know they're bigots.  Political correctness is stifling debate and leading people to believe that only their position is correct and all other opinions should be shouted down.  Dissent should be silenced according to the "tolerant" ones.  The science is settled, etc. etc. etc.That isn't how it works.  The society we've built and allowed to be built has given way to a brave new world where people are fearful to speak their minds.  When someone does have the audacity to speak their mind, we claim they are hateful and are causing violence.  That is just not correct.  Violent agitators cause violence.  Bigotry causes violence.  Intolerance causes violence.  Not Donald J Trump.  He's just voicing his opinions, however rude and crass.Donald Trump is by far not the ideal candidate.  Is he Hitler?  Hardly.  I'd think of him more along the lines of Nixon and LBJ, perhaps a bit of FDR.My statement that they know not what they do is an appeal to my fellow Conservatives to not be angered by people.  It is an allusion to the words of Jesus Christ in in Luke 23:34.  Is it ridicule to point out that someone has received an indoctrination?  Most people don't even realize they've been indoctrinated.  Take religion for example, are not Christians, Jews, Muslims,etc. indoctrinated into their faith and beliefs?  Is it ridicule to point it out?Is the criteria for ridicule now a simple disagreement with another person?  This goes back to the whole tolerance argument from the mid 90's and intolerance is the new tolerance.  I'd rather examine how we got here and how we can get away from it than to ridicule someone who has had no choice in the matter.Political correctness is the enemy of free speech, because PC hinges upon the admonishment "You can't say that!" being true.</comment>

He had lost Zimmerman and had to double back and lie in wait to challenge the "crazy-ass cracker" who was acting conscientiously to keep tabs on what the 9-1-1 dispatcher had determined was a credible threat. He could have reached sanctuary at his relative's house and never been heard from or of again. But the ghetto attitude prevailed. He thought he'd teach that cracker a lesson, and he got what he deserved. That's according to a multi-racial jury of his peers, by the way.</comment>

Besides "stalking" someone is not a self defense situation unless that person is trying to grab you or break into where you are at. Bashing someone else's head on the pavement IS a case where self defense is justified.   He had a phone and it worked, he was talking to that young woman.

Douglas Cowdrick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 9:16 AM::<comment>I'm trying to figure out how Zimmerman started screaming, the neighbors called 911 about it, the shot was fired and George injured himself enough to fit his story in the 2 minutes or so before the cops showed up. Damn criminal genius!  Or the cops helped him create the story and manufactured the evidence of the injuries and other details with him on the way to the police station.   Which theory do you think is right? That other moron in Florida who shot those kids over loud music and words exchanged got away got off too right. Tell that to him in prison, which might be quite a long time besides his present sentence when they try him again on the deadlocked charges.    Guess what? Juries are not stupid. Tell a bullshit story to one and you go to prison.    You've been looking at the pictures of the 12 year old Trayvon the media shows all the time and not at the real situation. He was 17, taller than Zimmerman and a well muscled healthy MAN who attacked someone in the dark and kept attacking till he got shot. If he had of punched him in the face, knocking him down, and left it would of ended there. But he jumped on top and started bashing his head into the ground.    Oh yeah I forgot how George managed to injure Trayvon's hand in such a manner that matched exactly what you get if you hit someone hard in the head. Damn that George is Fucking Pure A-1, FUCKING CRIMINAL MASTERMIND! He did it in less than 3 minutes. Should of been a jewel thief or something, wasted that nefarious talent becoming one of the most hated, unemployable people in America. Poor person now too. Such a shame.</comment>

At that point Martin was the initiator, NOT Zimmerman5) Zimmerman was NOT "ordered" to do or not do anything6) The 911 operator had NO LEGAL authority to order anyone aroundSince your basic premise is ALL WRONG.So are your conclusions and your false narrative.I would suggest you educate yourself on what really happened.</comment>

According to her (a friend of Martin who had no motive whatsoever to help Zimmerman,) Martin lost Zimmerman, got home, put down the famous Skittles and iced tea, and went back to find Zimmerman and confront him.  He found him, attacked him, and died in the fight.  This is backed by by the Zimmerman polygraph as well.  The reality of what happened and the media narrative of what happened are as divergent as the reality of Mike Brown vs. "hands up don't shoot."</comment>

But no, he just keep it up including trying to take Z gun. Martin brought his death on himself as did Brown. BLM is a big LIE.Zimmerman and Wilson were both scapegoats for America propensity to pander to black underclass criminality and now Trump is exploiting this.

DisputeOntime::Sunday, March 6, 2016 11:05 PM::<comment>I suppose you'll vote for Hillary but you and all who are thinking of voting for her do your due diligent research on her past.The things that Hillary and her husband have done would shock everyone: “Sexual misconduct and harassment not to mention abuse, misappropriation of donation finances, money laundering through their foundation, terror tactics and harassment of people that can turn them in etc. etc. etc.”you would also find a long list (over 90) of people that were associated with the Clintons during their political carrier and even before that which were reported mysteriously killed by a bullet, committed suicide, or died in a car or plane crash. These were people that had some kind of information about the Clintons’ that would have more than likely landed them in prison. And let’s not forget to mention all the other most resent events of Mrs. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in which she put our nation in jeopardy and no doubt was a direct cause of all who died in Benghazi.I feel sorry for the African Americans who are being exploited by the Clintons and they believe they will be represented and looked after when in fact the Clintons will really be looking out for themselves just like they've been doing for over 35 years. There are video links that show Hillary flipping on most of positions that she now claims to be running on and she says that she stands on her record. Well her record is dismal to say the least!</comment>

And from your response I see that you really haven't taken the time to do any real research and the real reason you want Hillary to win is probably cause you think the President should be a woman. I don't have anything against a woman being PROTUS. I just don't like the idea of someone who has committed so many crimes as the Clintons have and covered them up with all their wealth and power should be allowed to be back in the white house again. Plus one time of the shameful sexual demoralizing behavior of our President right in the Oval Office and then lied under oath is enough for me thank you! You do remember Monica Lewinsky don't you? By the way there were a lot more "Lewinsky's" in the 35 or more years in the career of Mr. Bill Clinton, and many cover up's by him and Hillary of the sexual abuses and rape that women had to put with during the Clintons'  rise to wealth and power!

Just for starters read the book 13 hours in Benghazi or go see the movie. Then maybe you'll understand that the lives of those Americans did matter and by no means should the events that brought their deaths should be considered "nonsense".It's so sad that some people think that the long list of dead people that have been left behind by the Clintons and all the other serious crimes committed by them not to mention the trash that they have heaped on our nation would be considered by the likes you as "nonsense".You're right "you wasn't born yesterday you were born today".</comment>

There were at least 5,000 found, and we currently are treating service members for exposure to chemical weapons. We made our troops jump through hoops to get covered because for some unexplainable reason, we didn't want to admit they'd been affected.</comment>

rich poorman::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:05 PM::<comment>Yep, I caught that NYT piece on Syrian chemical weapons. Nowhere did they connect the dots between the many reports of convoys heading to Syria on the eve of the 2003 Iraq invasion and the mysterious appearance of chemical weapons there a decade later. The paper didn't even address the central question of where the weapons came from.A fair treatment of the issue would have made some reference to the many (Democrat and Republican) lawmakers and policy insiders who publicly cited intel on Saddam's WMD program, and sought their comment on the Syrians' use.I can see the sub-headline I would have written: "Were they right about Saddam's WMDs?"But of course the NYT has long abandoned any pretense of objectivity.</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 2:16 AM::<comment>Yeah, I read that article, too. They were entirely made up of old and degrading stores. A direct quote from the piece in the Times:I'm kinda sick of seeing people cite the Times coverage or the exposure cases as exoneration of Bush's case by blurring the actual claims made by the Administration in the run up to the invasion, or by talking about UN rulings while ignoring that UN weapons inspectors who had been on the ground were reporting there was no evidence to support the Bush Administration's charges.</comment>

Bob Marley::Sunday, March 6, 2016 3:18 AM::<comment>Just as I'm kinda sick of seeing people lie about what actually happened. Mistakes were made, people were fooled, adjustments made, free elections occur, then, pull out, sectarian purge, and finally hell in a handbasket.There are very few innocent hands in what Iraq looks like today.</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 3:22 AM::<comment>Some are demonstrably less innocent than others, and I find it baffling and infuriating that there's a dedicated group of people (in the media, politics, and among the public) who want to insist it was all some happy accident, or--worse--that those least innocent have been exonerated by history.</comment>

Bob Marley::Sunday, March 6, 2016 11:44 AM::<comment>I'm with you. But, seeing as it was a Republican in the White House, we can assume there was more scrutiny.That said, if the press could kinda, sorta, maybe, find a potential fault with the intelligence, shouldn't we be skeptical?</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 8:14 PM::<comment>I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make.

White northern Republicans sold out southern blacks in 1877 as part of the bargain that resolved the contested presidential election.

Rururr_Jururr::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:18 PM::<comment>It was the Democrat party that held up major Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, not the Republicans.Here are the Senate votes on the 1964 Civil Rights Act by party & region:Southern Democrats: 1–20   (5–95%) (only Ralph Yarborough of Texas voted in favor)Southern Republicans: 0–1   (0–100%) (John Tower of Texas)Northern Democrats: 45–1   (98–2%) (only Robert Byrd of West Virginia voted against)Northern Republicans: 27–5   (84–16%)This was never an R-vs-D issue, it was a North-vs-South issue.  And you'll notice that the CRA had more support among Northern Democrats than among Northern Republicans.   Greasily implying that the Democrats as a whole were against the CRA is pretty stupid, seeing as they voted in favor of it 46-21 in the Senate.And now, of course, the Southern Democrat is a nearly-extinct political species, because their racist constituents found another party to vote for whose policies better suited their prejudices.</comment>

0bsoleteMan::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:58 PM::<comment>Your table also omits the fact that many of these Democrats had to be roped into voting for the bill by their own president, who at the time was a Democrat.Republicans were far more eager to vote on this than they were.</comment>

Rururr_Jururr::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:30 PM::<comment>The Northern Democrats had been pushing for a serious CRA since the disappointment of the toothless 1957 CRA.  They were bitterly opposed by the Southern faction of the party, especially once Kennedy - hated in the South - sent the original version of the bill to Congress in '63.  No Democratic Senator outside the South needed any encouragement to push for protection in public accommodation; indeed, they'd already fought that battle alongside the Northern Republicans (a redundancy, since there were almost no Southern Republicans) and lost just seven years prior.This isn't a partisan "gotcha" game for me, so I have no problem giving the Republican Party credit for the '64 CRA, though.  The Republican Party was a great force for racial justice in the immediate postwar era, and didn't compromise on those issues until Richard Nixon saw an opportunity to draw in the Southern voters abandoned by Johnson.  I just don't pretend that Congressional votes fifty years ago set the pattern for the parties' behavior since then.  Our major parties have taken on different roles throughout their history, and will probably look different in another fifty years as well.</comment>

Jeffn::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:22 PM::<comment>if anyone is wondering what that vague reference is in Beinart's article to the 1968 Democratic Party convention, it was the year that Democrats physically beat the ever loving stuffing out of leftist demonstrators. Demonstrators who included many people who loved burning down entire cities.It's cute when violent authoritarian leftists argue that they opposed violent authoritarianism.</comment>

Chris Sick::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:13 PM::<comment>You know it was Daley's PD that attacked the protestors, right? It wasn't like a call went up on the convention floor and all the attendees grabbed ax handles and ran out into the streets. And that--golly gee, this sounds familiar and topical--the police dramatically overreacted to planned peaceful protests and escalated violence, beginning with an attack on a peaceful protestor by cops that outnumbered protestors 2:1?It's all well and good to point out that authoritarianism generally doesn't have a natural political home and can sprout up in both leftist and rightist movements. It's another thing altogether to grasp at nearly fifty-year old examples of Democratic (not liberal) authoritarianism on a discussion about how Republicans are on the verge of nominating a candidate that reserves the right to have his supporters kick the crap out of people who disagree with him.</comment>

Jeffn::Thursday, March 3, 2016 10:55 PM::<comment>you know Beinart was the one who mentioned the '68 convention, right? Without letting people know why he mentioned it. He mentioned it because  actual examples violence against protestors in presidential election seasons are relevant in an article about hypothetical violence against protestors in election seasons. Daley was a Democrat- a very prominent one. Do you want to attempt to argue that Daley had no contact with the organizers of his party's convention in his city and that his police force just happened by accidentally (to join along with federal agents and security goons hired by the party that did the beatings)? If you do this will be fun, please have at it.</comment>

Chris Sick::Thursday, March 3, 2016 11:11 PM::<comment>I'm sure it'd be great for you if I argued some ridiculous nonsense that you seem to think is at all related to what I've said. Trump's authoritarian overtones aren't hypothetical: His supporters have attacked peaceful protestors at his rallies while he's egged them on from the podium and defended it after the fact, and even encouraged greater violence.I read Beinart's article, I didn't stop at the line about the '68 convention as you appear to have. It was an aside to an historical event I assume most people have a least a passing awareness of and can read as a shorthand for "when protestors are met with violence by those in charge."The big takeaway from '68 isn't that Democrats can be thugs, too, the most basic historical knowledge should tip the hand of that one. The big takeaway--for Beinart's argument, that I don't totally agree with but you seem to have missed entirely--is that protestors with legitimate grievances can become foils for strongman politicans. And targets.But for you to take that and try and spin it as "leftists are the real authoritarians!" would be ridiculous by itself. The fact that you're doing so in response to--I repeat--an article about how Republicans are on the verge of nominating an authoritarian who seems to relish his supporters' most violent tendencies is just sadly comic.</comment>

Jeffn::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:46 AM::<comment>"Disruption" is the use of force to prevent something that would otherwise happen- Bernie Sanders was intimidated off the stage he rented and the people who came to hear him didn't get the opportunity they wanted. Trumpians shoved a guy who tried to scream in their ears and prevent them from having a rally. I guarantee you if Bernie was physically chased off the stage at every rally somebody would start shoving the "protestors" too.There is no partisan difference on how to handle people who want to use force to stop events. So we get Beinart pretending we're talking about peaceful protest rather than forceful disruption, and glibly glossing over the fact that punching back twice as hard has a long standing bi-partisan acceptance rate. I write this as a guy who cheered when left activists tried to take 2x4s to Klan members in Maryland when they blocked a street.</comment>

Chris Sick::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:27 AM::<comment>Screaming is not violence, no matter how badly you might like it to be so your cowardly equivocations make sense. There's a whole host of non-violent, but nonetheless "disruptive," tactics protestors use that most people who aren't grasping at ludicrous straws wouldn't say justified physical assault in retaliation.Here's a helpful list of violence at Trump events in response to peaceful protestors. That I don't actually expect you to read, absorb, or respond to. In part because many of them are the same examples Beinart's already offered that you believe are countered by gamely pointing out Chicago had a D in the Mayor's office in 1968.Three things:1) You're just shifting goalposts as fast you possibly can now, rather than address the points I made about your attempts at false equivocation. And hey, I would too if my argument was as weak as yours; I just don't want you assuming no one noticed.2) Disruption is emphatically not force, it is disruption. That's why we call it that, instead of force. Saying disruption is force is liking saying voting for voter ID is a hate crime.3) You continue to be painfully disingenuous in your defense of Trump and his supporters: we're not talking about one guy who got out of hand and was pushed out the back door. One black protestor who shouted about Black Lives Matter got dragged out by security while supporters around him shouted "burn him" and "Sieg Heil." One got punched, kicked, and choked. Even when protestors are peacefully escorted out, the crowds shout and spit on them, and when security doesn't peacefully escort them, they're invariably at best shoved and pushed and at worst punched or kicked. In Virginia, students planning a silent protest were told to leave before the candidate even appeared. This isn't some normal facet of regular political business, this is something entirely different and darker, and in contemporary politics, its home is solely on the American right.</comment>

Jeffn::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:18 AM::<comment>Wait, so "screaming isn't violence" unless it's protestors being escorted out and being screamed at, in which case it's "entirely different and darker." Remind me of who's moving goal posts here.Disrupt an event is to stop it, end it, make it so you can't do what you want to do. If it's successful disruption it's by definition violence- either intimidation or physical prevention of activity.  If somebody "disrupts" your intent to leave a store or office they can actually be charged with kidnapping. If they scream at you it's assault under the law and if they touch you it's battery. You want your cake and eat it to. You want to march onto a stage, prevent Bernie Sanders from giving the speech by intimidation if he doesn't move from the lectern, or physical assault if you push him away from it. That is not  "peaceful protest." Peaceful protest is holding up a sign politely during his speech. It's chanting before and after the speech. It's lining the walkway, but not blocking it, to let attendees know how you feel. I saw a peaceful protest at a Rubio rally last weekend. The guy held a sign quietly denouncing Rubio and crowd politely walked by. Nobody yelled, nobody spit, some in the crowd knew him and said "hi." You don't want that, you want that guy blocking the door, rushing the stage, screaming in people's faces . You want to pretend there's no difference. You want to be outraged if anyone respond s in kind. I understand why you want this. You don't think peaceful protest works as well. Guess what, people punch protestors because they don't think politely asking them to hush during the speech works as well. Violence begets violence.As far as applying my principle only to the left- non-sense. I think any right-winger who tries to physically or through intimidation stop an event should be arrested. It's wrong and it's violent. Anyone who hits a "disruptor" should be charged with battery, at the same as the "disruptor" is charged with assault, physical intimidation, trespass in many cases and even kidnapping if they prevent people from going where they want to do.</comment>

Chris Sick::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:38 AM::<comment>It's a shame you weren't on hand during the Civil Rights era; clearly MLK, et. al. needed your definition of protest and it's a wonder they had any success at all without following your advice. What with all the violence of sit-ins and boycotts.Again, disruption is disruption and violence is violence. Yelling "Black Lives Matter" at Trump in the middle of his speech is an entirely different manner of disruption than yelling "burn him" and "Sieg heil" at a black man. Particularly when the former example is the most disruptive behavior of protestors and the latter example is the least offensive example from Trump supporters. And--again--Trump has been given every opportunity to repudiate this sort of behavior and at every turn has justified it ("...my supporters are very passionate." in response to news of a violent attack on a Hispanic man by two brothers who told police "Trump is right") or encouraged it as it happened ("...in the old days he would've been carried out on a stretcher.").Much like how taking an ad out about a private citizen and claiming the have sexual congress with farm animals or their family would be defamation, when done to a public figure or elected official, the rules get blurrier. Yelling in someone's face on the street corner is assault. Yelling at a political rally is not. And for your analogy to work, I'd have to be able to call the cops and say that they guy who was rudely talking on his cell phone and didn't move out of my way at the Kwik-e-Mart is guilty of kidnapping.And your entire position in this conversation has been to claim that Democrats are somehow demonstrably worse than Republicans, or that past behavior by Democrats is demonstrably worse than anything coming out of Trump's camp. Now you wanna pretend you're just a plain-speaking, non-ideological truthteller?C'mon.</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 8:16 PM::<comment>Yes, me telling you to shut up because you're an idiot is an example of liberals everywhere suppressing speech. In this context, shut up was actually a helpful bit of advice, designed to prevent you from further embarrassing yourself with your spittle-flecked rage. That's the tricky thing about speech, very rarely are you actually stopped. Very often you're judged by what you say.You're now ranting straight out of the Stromfront pages and I'm done with you. Obama is racist to whites? BLM is out to burn down cities? Trump just wants to stop illegal immigration while halting all Muslim immigration? Are you for real? You think the Kristol story is about how Kristol must be a racist because he opposed affirmative action? Did you see and read all the words before it? Can you read?</comment>

Jeffn::Friday, March 4, 2016 7:38 PM::<comment>You're entirely failing to understand.Civil Rights era? I'm not a pacifist, I'm completely cool with taking over a diner to protest segregation. I just don't call it "peaceful." The point of those protests was to get arrested. Sometimes you have to use violence, the threat of violence or incitement to violence. One of those times is not "OMG, Bernie Sanders is going to give a speech, let's bum-rush the stage!"So let's go back to the rally example. The guy holding a sign was a "peaceful protestor". If he ran over and physically blocked the door that people passionately wanted to enter, he would be changing to an incitement to violence (a violent act- the only way for people to get through the door is to physically unblock the door). IMO blocking the door should get you arrested. Anyone in the crowd who tried to push him out of the door should get arrested (they have a responsibility to call the cops, who have a duty to unblock the door). Your position is that blocking the door is only wrong depending on who blocks it. If an leftist blocks the door and prevents rightists from entering, then the door blocker is a "peaceful protestor" and the crowd pushing him out of the way is made up of authoritarian scum. If, however, a right wing guy blocks the door to prevent leftists from rushing in and disrupting the rally, then of course the guy blocking the door is now the authoritarian scum and the crowd is clearly "peaceful protestors." That is an inconsistent position. It shouldn't matter what ideology either the crowd or the door blocker has. Blocking the door is wrong, pushing the door blocker is wrong. If your "protest" is to block the door, collect your ride to the jailhouse and your moral victory. Just like MLK did. The big difference these days is that MLK protested an actual wrong- like them or not, there's nothing at all "wrong" about either Trump or Sanders giving a speech to their supporters.</comment>

Chris Sick::Friday, March 4, 2016 9:48 PM::<comment>Giving up on paragraph breaks doesn't create moral consistency in your argument. Calling nonviolent protest a form of violence doesn't make it so--it's right there in the name, I cannot believe I have to explain this to an actual adult. There are numerous forms of protest and direct action that are inherently disruptive, noisy, and even illegal (like the long tradition of trespass as occupation) that are not, in any way, violent.Your constant insistence that they are doesn't make it so.My position isn't about left or right. It's about calling you out on your BS equivocations to try and elide the charge against someone on the right by fumbling for examples for the left. You're creating meaningless and utterly bizarre hypotheticals (what protestor barred a door?) to justify a morally indefensible position. If Sanders' had security escort protestors out instead of left the stage that would've been both legal and no sign of authoritarianism. Just as if the protestors' goal had been to silently hold up signs, it would've been harder to justify making them leave. If Sanders supporters had shouted racial epithets at black supporters while they were escorted out or physically attacked while he stood at the podium talking about how they deserved it, we'd be having this conversation about Sanders. But we're not, because it is Trump who justifies the violence of his supporters, who have attacked protestors multiple times.What about that is so hard for you to understand or accept? You're claiming I have a different standard for left/right, but the reality is that there isn't any contemporary example of candidates or their supporters on the left acting like Trump. There's nothing inconsistent in my position and nothing at all related to partisan tribalism. That's on you, dog. This started because you just had to insist that the authoritarian impulse is on the left, not the right... by appealing to a greatly exaggerated and misunderstood retelling of the 1968 Democratic Convention.</comment>

Jeffn::Friday, March 4, 2016 11:26 PM::<comment>One more time, to make it simple enough even for you: If you change the tactic to the point where you are physically preventing someone from doing what they want to do, it is no longer a peaceful protest. There is no way for the target to do what they want to do without physically ending your prevention. That is the intent of the protest- violent conflict.If you physically block a door, it has to be physically unblocked. We can call that a deliberate provocation to violence if it makes you feel better, but the intent is clearly to create a violent interaction.Screaming in the ears of people who want to hear a talk is another example. There is no way to stop the physical prevention of your ability to hear than to physically stop the screaming. The screamer knows this when they do it. Either violence or no speech. It is deliberate.Barging Bernie Sanders' stage is another example. It is not a "peaceful" act- it's entire purpose is to declare that if you want to hear Bernie you need to physically push them off the stage. It's purpose is to create a violent conflict where none exists.  By the way, you do know the crowd screamed at the activists then too: http://www.nbcnews.com/politic...(happy with the extra line breaks yet?)This started because Beinart want's to claim that a physical response to violent protest is new and troubling. It isn't. It started because you and Beinart really, really want to pretend violent protest tactics are "peaceful protests." They aren't. Throughout this, I've consistently said violent protest tactics by either side and violent response by either side is wrong. You have yet to agree for some fascinating reason you amusingly dance around.As for which side uses violent protest tactics more often (we can use your term "disruption" if it makes you happy), well I'm all ears. Pull out those examples of right wing activists blocking streets or shutting down speeches by rushing the stage or screaming over them and I'll be happy to talk about them.  I can't think of any offhand, so it seems pretty reasonable to discuss whether a tactic favored by the left is a good one or not and what the acceptable response to that tactic on the right should be. I suspect we'll see a lot more lefties disrupting Trump rallies than we'll see righties disrupting Clinton rallies, but I could be wrong. My opinion, consistently expressed here, is that protestors shouldn't physically disrupt anyone's rallies and nobody at any rallies should physically attack disruptors.</comment>

Chris Sick::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:03 AM::<comment>Guy, I swear to god, you can keep on saying it, but a nonviolent act is not a violent act just because you really, really, really don't like Democrats or Black Lives Matter. An environmental activist chaining themselves to a tree to stop logging impedes the ability of the loggers to do their job. It is not violent just by virtue of the fact that it stops them. Spiking a tree so that logging equipment is damaged or destroyed and loggers injured or killed is violence. You cannot grasp the distinction, because you insist on not grasping the distinction, because to admit the distinction means your entire argument falls apart.And again, you misunderstand Beinart's argument--and my own--which explains (or maybe causes) your kneejerk hyper-partisaniship to kick into overdrive. Beinart doesn't appear to me to be arguing that violent reactions to political protest is new or different. Anyone who has sat through an eighth grade history class would know that's not true. His point is that in times of social upheaval, strongman politicians will use peaceful protestors and activists as foils to bolster their support, and that their supporters will frequently either support or enact violence against those protestors.From this very basic--and incredibly willfully obtuse--misunderstanding of yours, and the conflation of "disruption" or nonviolent protest (or incitement to violence, you weakly offer, as though violence and the incitement of it are the same, or even--more basically--that you could call a protest an incitement) with violence you want to argue the left and right are the same. Here's the headline: I don't care. Political violence both domestically and globally, both contemporary and historically, has no ideological home, and I've said as much multiple times. From the Red Army Brigades to Earth First! to lone wolf abortion terrorists to the Klan, both sides of the ideological spectrum have examples of undertaking extreme politically-motivated violence.That said, and to repeat myself (again), that isn't the argument we're having. If you want a parallel to the kind of campaign Trump is running and the kind of politician he is on the left, you'd have to reach back to Huey Long or George Wallace (as Beinart does). No one, anywhere has said this is a new phenomenon, or exclusively a conservative one. But--and again, again, again--it is a phenomenon that is currently taking place on the right, with no obvious parallel on the left.</comment>

Jeffn::Saturday, March 5, 2016 2:36 AM::<comment>unfortunately Trump is doing just fine without "strongman tactics." I don't think it reduces his vote total, but I don't think it increases it either. You could certainly say it will attract the violently inclined to his rallies, but it's pretty obvious that using in-your-face tactics attracts the same type to the protest groups.Let's take a deep breath and take politics totally out of this. A group of passionate devotees of the god Zeus hold a service. Joe, a passionate devotee of the god Cthulu, decides to protest. If Joe stands quietly nearby holding a "Go Cthulu!" sign, he is a "peaceful protestor."If Joe rushes the Zeus altar, grabs the microphone, halts the service, and screams pledges to Cthulu. I maintain that is a different tactic than standing politely with a sign. Do you? If see any difference at all in the tactics, what difference do you see?If Joe gets beaten up, I'm more upset about it in the first instance than the second- he went looking for a fight and got one.  Joe is blameless in the first, not in the second. More importantly, in the first Zeusians are clearly authoritarian. In the second instance Cthulus are clearly authoritarian (shutting down others is classic strongman), but we don't really know if Zeusians are.</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 2:28 AM::<comment>Guy. Jesus christ, guy. C'mon. You're now at the point of creating hypotheticals to illustrate your point because--again--there are no real world examples anywhere that back up any facet of your argument, anywhere. To wit:Trump isn't doing "fine" without strongman tactics. His campaign has been making use of such tactics since the beginning. His earliest coverage grew out of his extreme rhetoric regarding deportations and walls. It's not some occasional slip-up, it's the bedrock of his appeal. You can--and, I'm sure will continue to--insist on false equivocations about how BLM's protestors are "in your face" as Trump supporters, but you're still stuck with the problem that BLM protests aren't degenerating into curbstomp parties if someone shows up and starts shouting racist crap. Whereas, there's actual outbreaks of violence spontaneously occurring at Trump rallies that the candidate himself justifies that you insist on not recognizing as such, instead wanting to insist that beating, kicking, and choking a man is totally the same as marching to the front of a stage and yelling so that poor ol' Bernie can't speak.Your next hypothetical might as well involve four-headed space Aliens from Planet Zorp who speak through a complex process of pheromone emission. I'm sure it'll be a wonderful piece of speculative fiction, but it has absolutely nothing to do with anything that is actually going on in this year's election. Taking politics out of it won't help. Changing names won't help. Trying to mount a disingenuous semantical argument won't help. Because they're all in service of a great lie that what is happening at Trump's rallies has a modern, mainstream, corollary on the Left. It doesn't. Stop trying.</comment>

Jeffn::Monday, March 7, 2016 5:57 AM::<comment>Good Lord, you can't even acknowledge a difference between politely holding a sign and actively trying to shut down other people's events. I knew you weren't very quick witted, but didn't realize you were entirely dishonest. OMG somebody who went looking for a fight at a Trump rally found one! Where's mah fainting couch, Rhett, it's the apocolypse for certain!</comment>

Matthew L.::Saturday, March 5, 2016 11:12 PM::<comment>This is actually an interesting thread.Jeffn is defining a "violent act" not so much as physical harm but including acts intended to intimidate or cause emotional discomfort. Which I think some definitions of "violence" include. A cursory glance via Google shows some definitions that use physical harm as the basis, and some that doesn't.Pretty sure it's just a semantic disagreement. The only truly "non-violent" protest then would be a boycott.My two cents: I don't think either side is better than the other. Conservatives (Or, rather, those associated with the GOP since not all are "Conservatives") don't want People of Color to be oppressed.Rather, they (and all whites fear this somewhat imho) are afraid of the backlash if the pendulum of power swings towards the people we've oppressed. You can't expect a people to willfully put themselves in that sort of position without extreme resistance.</comment>

Chris Sick::Sunday, March 6, 2016 2:35 AM::<comment>I disagree. There's a long and rich philosophical debate over what constitutes violence. But that's not the disagreement we're having, and if you'd like further proof of that, please do note the ways in which Jeffn has jumped from one argument to the next, with no connection between the two. Beginning with his argument that the 1968 Chicago Police Riots "prove" the left is the real authoritarians. That was his initial position, not a nuanced restatement of what actually might constitute violence, not even a weak "on the other hand" statement like "both sides are bad." But an insistence that an event nearly 50 years ago shows how leftists are more authoritarian than rightists. Now we've devolved down into imaginary protest tactics from imaginary counter-cults.This article--and indeed, my argument here and Jeff's central misunderstanding--say nothing about any side being better than the other. But it's noteworthy and impossible to ignore that the most fascistic tendencies on display in contemporary American politics are happening on the right and greatly disavowed by the left. That means something.But then we get to the crown jewel of your comment, the final two paragraphs. I can't even figure out what you're on about there. It's okay for white voters to back a strong man candidate because their fear of a multicultural/minority-majority country is... right? Just? Really?</comment>

Matthew L.::Sunday, March 6, 2016 5:41 AM::<comment>Don't misunderstand. Definitely don't agree with the GOP or it's goals. However, it's easy to see it for what it is. For me, anyway. There's a part of me that really truly feels the backlash that has been building up for centuries. First through actual chattel slavery, then Jim Crow, and now mass incarceration.Mass incarceration takes away the vote. Voter ID laws make it difficult for those who have the most interest in voting to change their circumstances via a poll tax. Through a lack of affordable childcare options, limitations on actual family planning methods (Birth control, abortion), and the breakdown of the nuclear familiar via the carceral state, thousands are unable to vote as well.My response likely seemed unrelated; Hence the "my two cents" part in relation to the article. Apologize for that. However, I truly feel the rage that I would feel in such circumstances is why many are fearful and flocking to Trump as the 'strong man candidate'. They're afraid the evils we outwardly did, or allowed to knowingly happen, will be revisitedThis fact, more than any other, is the reason (I believe, firmly) for the rise of Trump.</comment>

Chris Sick::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:34 AM::<comment>Y'know the real problem with this whole debate you & I are having? You're operating from a position where your one + only priority is to defend the Right and implicate the Left. I don't give a crap about the Left, because I'm not married to some tribal identity. So we're stuck having two different conversations where I'm--and others, like Beinart--are saying "authoritarianism and fascism is bad!" And the best counter you can weakly offer is that Republicans aren't the real facists, Democrats are.</comment>

Nor is he obligated to do so. Quoting crime statistics is not an argument in any case, but Beinart’s main point was not to validate BLM but to suggest the possibility that the Trump candidacy presages a return to 1960s-style violent confrontations between protestors and police.
