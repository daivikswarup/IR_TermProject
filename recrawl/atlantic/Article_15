Trump Is Redefining the Republican Party


For Republicans, the distance is collapsing between the unthinkable and the inevitable.The runway lights are lit for Donald Trump to land the Republican presidential nomination after his commanding victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. That trifecta has provided the front-runner a big tailwind heading into the crucial stretch when 28 more states will vote through March 15. As important, Trump’s winning streak has shown that none of his rivals yet has a plausible plan for stopping him. That means the GOP is poised for a leap into the electoral unknown behind a fundamental redefinition of the party from Trump that could shape its fortunes for years.How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceThe Nevada caucus was modestly attended (even with record turnout) and chaotically administered. But those clouds could not obscure Trump’s success. In Nevada, as in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he demonstrated that his support transcends the fissures that have previously defined Republican nomination contests. In all three states, he carried men and women; Republicans and independents; and both those who identified as evangelical Christians and those who did not. Spanning ideological boundaries, Trump carried voters who identified as very conservative, somewhat conservative, and moderate in all three states as well, except in South Carolina where Ted Cruz edged him among the most conservative.The one divide that has consistently characterized Trump’s candidacy is education. Trump has posted dominant numbers among white Republicans without a college degree in his three victories; he attracted an identical 42 percent of those blue-collar whites in his first two wins and 52 percent in Nevada. In those three states, as well as Iowa, Trump has notched less support among Republican voters with at least a four-year college degree. That pattern held in Nevada, but Trump’s strong 40 percent showing with college-educated whites there not only comfortably led the field but also significantly topped his previous high (30 percent in New Hampshire). Nevada is a small quirky state, but the evidence suggests that as Trump advances his coalition is growing not shrinking.His rivals can’t say the same, particularly Cruz. Building on a base among evangelical Christians, the Texan sold himself as the candidate who could unite cultural and economic conservatives—succeeding where Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012, the last two evangelical favorites, had failed. But Cruz has not carried more than 18 percent of voters who are not evangelicals in any of the first four states. That’s no better than Huckabee or Santorum.And after winning evangelical Christians in Iowa, Cruz has now lost them to Trump in three consecutive contests. Cruz has been squeezed between Rubio’s appeal to evangelicals with a four-year college degree and Trump’s much larger inroads among those without. If Cruz can’t reverse that pattern, he will fail in such heavily evangelical March 1 states as Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. That would effectively undermine his candidacy, even if he holds Texas.Ohio Governor John Kasich is the mirror image of Cruz. He’s run well among moderates, but shown too little appeal beyond them to truly compete. Yet efforts to pressure Kasich from the race may falter because Rubio has left the Ohio governor such a clear lane by tilting his own agenda well to the right of the primarily white-collar, mainstream-conservative voters most resistant to Trump.The Rubio paradox is that he wants to sell Republicans on a profound change in image without meaningfully rethinking many of the party’s core positions—or even directly resisting Trump’s radical redefinition of them. In South Carolina, Rubio assembled a Republican rainbow coalition of supporters led by Asian American Governor Nikki Haley, African American Senator Tim Scott, and white male Representative Trey Gowdy, all 51 or younger. Against that backdrop, the 44-year-old Cuban American senator delivered a compelling message (and visual representation) of generational and demographic change. “The children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership,” Rubio buoyantly declared.But Rubio has wrapped that dynamic message around an agenda that, with only a few innovative exceptions, mostly embraces conventional conservative positions. These include big tax cuts that primarily benefit top earners; skepticism about climate change; and some of the field’s most unbending social views, including opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and clear suggestions he wants to reverse the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. And rather than confront Trump’s nativist and protectionist agenda, Rubio has mostly bent to it, tacking right on both immigration and trade.While Rubio offers the GOP a different face, it’s Trump who actually presents a different direction. He would steer the party toward a confrontational European-style racial nationalism revolving around hostility to foreign influences (from Mexican immigrants to Chinese manufacturers) and domestic elites. That represents not only a fundamental assault on the party’s existing leadership, but a huge gamble with its electoral future. Even if Trump, as the nominee, could squeeze out a narrow victory in November by mobilizing more working-class whites he might still disastrously stamp the GOP as a party of racial backlash to the minorities and Millennials irreversibly growing in the electorate. As Trump steamrolls toward the nomination, it’s difficult to overstate how much the GOP has at stake—or how poorly positioned his rivals are to stop him.


CWB::Thursday, February 25, 2016 6:24 PM::<comment>Race is most significantly an ideological difference. Population genetic differences, and their phenotypic expression, between racial groups are miniscule relative to differences within racial groups. And metrics for innate ability overlap so heavily that they are meaningless as differentiators. That means race for all practical purposes is a social construct.</comment>

Phranqlin::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:39 PM::<comment>You're using a genetic disease to justify racism?  Sickle cell anemia arose from exposure to malaria.  Having one copy of the gene gives partial immunity to malaria, but having two copies causes sickle cell anemia, which interferes with oxygen transportation in the blood. It is very painful and leads to a shortened lifespan.   The gene is present in populations other than African -- for instance, it's found in India, the Arabian peninsula, and the eastern Mediterranean -- that were exposed to endemic malaria.  In other words, it doesn't say jack-diddly about race, since not all black people carry this gene while numerous non-blacks do.And ... wait for it ... being part of a population that carries sickle cell trait DOES NOT MAKE YOU SUBHUMAN.  it simply means that your children are more susceptible to this disease.  </comment>

Phranqlin::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:37 AM::<comment>I'm talking about the social status of the Irish, not their skin color.  That's why "black" is in scare quotes.  Everyone knows (or should know) that the Irish once faced tremendous discrimination in America. Remember the old signs "No Irish Need Apply"?  Read the book "How the Irish Became White" for a more full discussion.My larger point is that ethnic groups which we now view as "white" were once considered to be anything but, proving the idea of racially based political parties to be useless and ridiculous.</comment>

CWB::Thursday, February 25, 2016 9:39 PM::<comment>There is no Latino race. Or if you insist there is then there is also a European race (by geography) or an English race (by language). What is real is that we are biologically predisposed to have an aversion (dislike, fear)  to the other. We are very good at finding ways to label the other. So we make up social constructs like race and justify them in this case by population genetic differences.</comment>

manofsan::Friday, February 26, 2016 7:40 AM::<comment>That's still better than selling yourself to the shadowy PACs. Even Bernie with his forest of tiny contributors is better than Hillary or the other mainstream candidates, who've all been bought up by the PACs. With power comes corruption, and the world's most powerful democracy has naturally been corrupted by these PACs, which exist to wield disproportionate influence (and perhaps even all-powerful influence) over the democratic setup.Trump is a genius who has completely bypassed the political stranglehold of the PACs by getting effectively all his advertising for free, while others were stuck paying tens of millions for theirs. As a natural instinctive negotiator, Trump easily saw how to exploit the premise of this system, and has parlayed it into a very successful campaign. Who among his rival candidates would have even thought of such an idea, let alone attempted it? None of them have the nerve that he does, nor the experience to confidently to so.Trump is a political pioneer with a highly original style all his own.</comment>

Follow the money, though, and it's redistribution upward, like every other Repub Presidential candidate.There's not much plausible in his protectionism, because it all relies on other nations accepting his bullying to take a worse deal than they're now getting. Maybe he can get a tiny shift in that direction, but not much, because there's not much in it for the other nations. They'll just say no, and when he threatens to raise tariffs on what they export to us (never mind that that'd be illegal under the GATT treaty we're signatory to, as well as other treaties, so he legally can't), they'll threaten to raise tariffs on the things we export that they buy, like food and technology and movies and aircraft.

The Refudiator::Thursday, February 25, 2016 6:54 PM::<comment>Other than splitting the GOP into several pieces, I think what scares the "elites" the most is that Trump destroys the carefully crafted narrative of the "conservative movement". Instead of strict and reverent adherence to the so called conservative principles that significantly reward the top earners in the nation, Trump peels off 40% of the Republican base by offering them a decent job and payback to the forces that they believe  have put the American middle class in extremis. Moreover, Trump and his successors can revisit that theme each election, blaming its failure on liberals, immigrants, whoever, in the same way the old school GOP did with the ever escalating anti-government and tax cut rhetoric.

The Refudiator::Thursday, February 25, 2016 7:24 PM::<comment>Nice try.  If you didn't know, and apparently you dont, just having a simple majority in the Senate since 2008 isn't good enough. You need 60 votes to pass any legislation since Obama took office , enough to force cloture and a floor vote. Just like Mitch said he would require:"The correct count of how many bills have been filibustered during Obama's presidency is: approximately all of them. That's what it means to have a 60-vote Senate, which is what Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans declared as soon as Obama was elected. Almost every measure and, until Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Democrats invoked the nuclear option last fall, almost every nomination, had to have 60 or more votes to pass. That's a filibuster." Bloomberg Politics"Prior to Obama there were 68 nominations successfully blocked, in the entire history of the country.  This administration has had 79 nominations blocked, in other words instead of 49% as the Democrats had claimed, nearly 54% of all nominations ever blocked have been his nominations."

John Ranta::Thursday, February 25, 2016 7:07 PM::<comment>It seems to me that Trump is not so much redefining the Republican party as exposing its unspoken agenda. Since Lee Atwater, the GOP has employed the dog-whistle to hint to racist and anti-government and nativist voters that they had a home in the Republican party. Trump has swapped the dog-whistle for a megaphone, that's all. How many Trump supporters have we heard say "I'm so glad he's saying what we've all been thinking".The challenge for the GOP elite is deciding whether or not they want to reject their racist, nativist, anti-government whisper campaign, and become a more moral, ethical party. </comment>

stmccrea::Saturday, February 27, 2016 3:14 AM::<comment>This is a typical right-wing trope that doesn't really fly when you really understand what racism is. Let's take Black Lives Matters, as an example. You probably think that is a racist organization. Why? Because it promotes the interests of black people? Explain that to me and I'll let you know why BLM is not and can't possibly be racist in the way the KKK is racist. There is all the difference in the world. Not saying there can't be black racists, but I am guessing you're confusing racism with bigotry, which is certainly rampant in people of every race and creed on the planet.</comment>

WookieInHeat::Tuesday, March 1, 2016 7:16 AM::<comment>"... a racist is anyone who disagrees with you..."is the liberal definition of the word.</comment>

MZale::Thursday, February 25, 2016 7:38 PM::<comment>Obviously, not all Republicans are racist. At the same time, however, it's disingenuous to suggest that the Trump campaign is not finding significant traction with what racists there are in the party.  Maybe they're simply the xenophobes or the ignorant, but there's a disenfranchised underbelly who have a great deal of hate for their motivation.The South Carolina exit polling was telling.  Trump voters were over two-thirds in favor of returning the Confederate Flag to the Statehouse.  A similar number believes that white people are more likely to be discriminated against than blacks.  Again, perhaps some of these folks are not racists, but you can't honestly say none are."Us against them" messages predicated upon innuendo about "others" is a long utilized, political tool because it does permit bringing racists into the fold without having to come clean about what one's trying to do.  Immigrants of different color are an easy scapegoat.  Even when the unsubstantiated leap is made from seeing more Hispanics in society to the conclusion that they're all "illegal Mexicans" reeks of a racism problem.  Punching down at the underclass as responsible for stagnant wage growth for under-educated natives, merely continues to avoid the true problem - the overclass is positioned to keep taking an increasing share of the nation's wealth (and that we've failed to better educate those natives).Show me real policies from Donnie that address this issue to gain votes, instead of "the presence of those 'other' people is the big problem", and I'll be more likely to consider the notion that racists are not a Trump target audience.</comment>

MintDragon::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:19 PM::<comment>I think it's more xenophobia than racism, though there's still some of that too, especially with the retiree crowd. However, it's not very common among younger Republicans. They aren't against Mexicans because they are brown. They are against illegal immigrant Mexicans because they aren't here legally. They might not be aware that most Hispanics are not only here legally, but are third, fourth, or even tenth generation residents of what is now U.S. territory. They aren't against Muslims because of their ethnicity. They're against them because they fear violent Islamist ideology, and don't understand that the vast majority of Muslims reject the Muslim killers called ISIS.There's some misunderstanding among some, but I don't even think a majority hold the above misconceptions. They're just very frustrated and are going with the political winds because those winds, right or wrong, at least have some momentum.</comment>

MZale::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:31 PM::<comment>"They're against them because they fear violent Islamist ideology, and don't understand that the vast majority of Muslims reject the Muslim killers called ISIS."Fine, then we'll just label it all as prejudice.  They're taking an individual or small subset's view and using it to malign the totality of the group, after all.  The fact remains the same, appealing to, and manipulating, people's ignorant prejudices for power is a vile practice.  Particularly when you're using it as a distraction from where the real problems lie.On some level, I'd almost wish Trump could actually build a wall and deport 11 Million people.  Then folks would see that there's still millions of brown faces left in the crowd, still poor wages for the middle and working classes - quite simply, that nothing has changed.</comment>

Phranqlin::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:47 AM::<comment>Bingo.  Rounding up all of the Mexicans and Muslims is not going to usher in utopia.  Quite the opposite.</comment>

Dancesmartly::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:08 PM::<comment>It's also possible that the economy would be worse. We'd have 11 million less consumers in a consumer driven economy and many of those people are also taxpayers. Many are paying payroll taxes at least with no hope of benefitting later.</comment>

WookieInHeat::Friday, February 26, 2016 1:21 PM::<comment>one thing that progressives seem to have a great deal of difficulty wrapping their heads round is that no one is afraid of islamic terrorism. people are afraid of islamic terrorism much in the way you'd presumably be afraid of dying in a horrific car crash. maybe it's crossed your mind, but is it something you think of regularly?people are not afraid, people are pissed off about the increasing frequency of brutal muslim terrorist attacks and rape gangs, and the "vast majority" of muslims largely doing sweet FA about it. but this makes perfect sense if you read the PEW study which surveyed 30k muslims, finding solid majorities in most islamic countries support sharia law, a legal system which condones the killing of non-muslims, punishes apostasy with death, and extensively details the sexual enslavement of non-muslim women.people are angry that muslims whine about racism and portray themselves as victims while resisting any real attempt to counter the "radicalism," misogyny, anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, etc. inherent in their religion, which they blame for the prejudices they endure.no other minority groups have established a pattern in multiple countries of organized, industrial scale massacres and pedophile gangs, it's only muslims. but yet they insist everyone else is the problem, "islamophobia" forces them to murder jews and rape prepubescent girls.</comment>

stmccrea::Saturday, February 27, 2016 3:09 AM::<comment>Hey, Mint,I'm afraid that some of the positions you're hearing propounded ARE racist, including assuming that all brown people who speak English with a Spanish accent are illegal immigrants, or that all Muslims are ISIS or terrorists. That's more than a misunderstanding, it is using one's privileged position to make broad judgments about a certain population and justifying both attitudes and policies that are oppressive against those populations, mostly because their assumptions remain unchallenged by the dominant mainstream culture. Probably most of them would be able to acknowledge that a certain Mexican-American or a certain Islamic person they know might not fit their stereotypes, but are still able to convince themselves that these people are anomalies and that "most" Mexican-Americans are illegal and need to be deported. Needless to say, Mr. Trump has quite intentionally gone out to promote and expand on these stereotypical ideas, which most definitely qualifies as racist.One doesn't have to hate all Mexicans or black people to be racist. One only needs to be willing to promote and support policies that oppress people based on race, and operate from attitudes and beliefs that promote such policies.</comment>

jp_in_nj::Saturday, February 27, 2016 12:34 AM::<comment>I'm pretty sure you weren't me. For one thing, you think I feel a 'smug sense of superiority' - maybe you did, back when you were "me", but I don't. I'm lucky as hell to be where I am. What small successes I've had in life are, in large part, due to social programs like tuition assistance and social security that were there when I needed them. That's where my "lib" desire for a useful government comes from - the money that was invested in me has paid off in spades, and because I'm *not* superior I believe it can do the same for others as well.Your straw-man construction is ridiculous; it's completely possible to be socially accepting and considerate and also not allow law-breaking.As for your last attempt at a point... if you're a believer in that white-supremacist, "Africa for the Blacks, Asia for the Asians," nonsense, there's nothing I can say to change your mind. But maybe I'm misreading you, in which case I'll say that, as little as you might like it, this country's entire reason for existence *is* its multiculturalism. From the first explorers who came here from multiple points of origin, to the first settlers who came here seeking freedom from the persecution they suffered at home, all the way up to the modern day with our fully integrated armed services, we're founded upon the concept (stop me if you've heard this) that all men are created equal. That's who we are. And, regardless of the doom and gloom pushed by Republican politicians, our multiculturalism has given us the strength and flexibility to succeed to economic, military, and technological heights never before seen in the history of humanity.</comment>

stmccrea::Friday, February 26, 2016 5:07 AM::<comment>"Anti-white rhetoric" (whatever THAT means) is not the same as racism. Racism is the intentional, systematic domination of one race by another, as well as the system of thinking and beliefs that justify such domination as "natural" and essential. Saying that "white people are racists," for example, is bigoted, but not racist. Saying, "A lot more black people than white people are stopped by police for no reason" is not racist at all, as it is simply a statement of facts as ascertained by statistics available to anyone who cares to look.Racism is often defined by the Right as "anything you say that suggests that any white person may be racist." The implicit assumption is that racism is a thing of the past, which is, in my view, as ridiculous an assertion as "cows can fly now."If you look at which candidate right-wing neo-Nazi hate groups are most likely to endorse, I would suggest that it is NOT going to be a Democrat. In fact, the person they seem to be most excited about in this race is, shockingly, DONALD TRUMP. And Trump would not even repudiate their support.So much for Democrats being the new face of racism.</comment>

It's quite clear that the GOP welcomed racists into the party in the 1970s, and have adopted planks and policies that mollify racists. But I never said that tax cuts for the wealthy are motivated by racism. They're not. The civil rights movement was partly a movement of civil disobedience. And there was a radical faction, for a period in the late 1960s, that supported taking up arms. But that push for armed rebellion was never part of the Democratic platform, in fact Democratic politicians rejected it outright (and were as much the targets as were Republicans). The GOP, with its support for the NRA and its radical interpretation of the 2nd amendment, is fostering armed revolt. Republican politicians encouraging "2nd amendment solutions" are radically anti-government. </comment>

There are plenty of non-racist reasons--social, political, and economic--to not want 11+ million illegal immigrants to remain in the country, legally or illegally.As for trade, Trump often doesn't sound so different from Bernie Sanders (or maybe you think he's a racist, too).  He's a free trade skeptic.  You have to have some serious tunnel vision to make that into a racist issue.And as for "anti-government," I don't think you've actually listened to Trump speak even once.  The rest of the conservative movement and Republican establishment is having fits about Trump most specifically because he is the most pro-government Republican to seriously threaten to take the nomination since the pre-Reagan days (you really probably have to go back to Eisenhower, maybe even longer).</comment>

bircall::Friday, February 26, 2016 2:25 AM::<comment>And where should the American citizens that are the children of many illegal immigrants go? Left here in the foster system? Kicked out with their parents and American citizenship?FWIW we call Trump a racist not because he doesn't want illegal immigrants but because he generalizes an entire group of people as "rapists, murderers and drug dealers" and the like. This is the definition of prejudice.</comment>

John Ranta::Friday, February 26, 2016 2:27 AM::<comment>I never said that I wanted to wave a magic wand to cure mmigration. And I agree that there are social, political and economic ramifications with immigration (many of them positive). I said Trump is a racist, and many of his followers love him for that. Trump brands immigrants as rapists, killers, drug runners and violent criminals. None of which is true, the rates of crime among immigrants is much lower than among American citizens. Trump wants to ban all Muslims from enterng the country. That's hardly a nuanced position, but yes, that is a different language than I and most Americans speak. Trump is not engaging us in a discussion of the economic and social ramifications of immigration. He's playing the racist demagogue, and throwng raw meat to his racist followers. There's no way to pretty that up.I don't think free trade is a racist issue. Never even mentioned free trade. And certainly wouldn't in conjunction with racism. </comment>

Terry "Death to Equality" Xu::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:04 AM::<comment>Not exactlyToo much of the american right is obsessed with trivial ideals like "small government" or "the constitution"What trump is doing is a normalization of right-wing politics - shifting it to directly conform with nationalism. Racism, xenophobia, and nativism are basically snarl words for "normal" in most parts of the world. This only feels unusual to you because america is not used to nationalism</comment>

John Ranta::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:12 AM::<comment>Um, huh? I am confused, but hold on, I need to chant, "USA, USA, USA!". Okay, I feel better, let's get back to your point. So what is this about America not being used to nationalism? And the rest of the world is? What "rest of the world" is more nationalistic than good ol' America? We invented nationalism, and it's red-white-and-blue and has chevies and apple pies too! Although, I keep hearing the strains of John Prine, reminding us that "your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore..." </comment>

stmccrea::Saturday, February 27, 2016 3:18 AM::<comment>There is a difference between "nationalism" and racist/fascist ideology. Trump is "nationalist" only for white people, and white racists support him because that's his message. If you accept that only white people are citizens of the USA, you can call it "nationalism," but if you consider any other people to be citizens, it's nothing more than racist, xenophobic demagoguery. It's the difference between saying "Buy American!" (nationalist) and "Don't buy from black people" (racist). Don't know if that kind of racism exists in your country, but it sure does here.</comment>

chemicalbank::Thursday, February 25, 2016 7:54 PM::<comment>Trump hasn't redefined anything; the Republican Party has worked hard for decades to bring itself to this very place. Rather than change with the times, as any business that wishes to stay afloat must do, the party has instead applied its efforts to turning out higher percentages of its shrinking base through increasingly hysterical, knee-jerk rhetoric. Now, it would appear, that base has figured out what has been true for many years, that the party really has nothing to offer it, and seeks a hero.Trump has simply been willing to rush in where even Republicans fear to tread. His message is an over the top version of what the party has been doling out all along, a cartoonish version of the Big Lie.</comment>

If any candidate wins at this point, it's likely to be Trump, and if Trump doesn't win, it'll be because of a brokered convention.Whatever the case, the GOP seems bound for defeat in November.</comment>

Dorian Gray::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:09 PM::<comment>Trump is showing who a lot of Republicans are:  people who drank the GOP's kool-aid all their lives and then woke up to realize they had been had by their own party elites. Trump isn't going away, and he won't be overcome by the likes of Cruz and Rubio.  In all likelihood, he will pick up a lot of votes in the general election from disaffected Democrats who are in the same economic demographic as his Republican supporters.

It's been the party of racial backlash for decades, from the infamous Southern Strategy to Willie Horton to birtherism.  It's also been the party of backlash to LGBT rights, feminism, contraception and abortion, science, civil rights -- indeed, social change in general.  And it's made a whole bunch of extravagant promises to those who are marginalized by current trends in society -- basically, that it's going to turn the clock back to an idealized past where men were Real Christian Men, women were Real Christian Women, those uppity Others were kept in their places, and America was a Strong Nation (never mind that this past only existed on TV and in nostalgia).While the grievances of the GOP electorate are often legitimate, the GOP had no intention of addressing them (and realistically, no clear way to do it).  But it sure did benefit at the ballot box from making them angry, stoking their resentment, and promising them the moon, then proceding with government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.  A classic case of bait and switch.With the ground prepared and the seeds planted, it was only a matter of time before an authoritarian daddy figure arose to reap the anger that the GOP so carefully nurtured.  It's a pity that a party so fond of traditionalism didn't pay attention to the very traditional sayings and proverbs that pointed to this very outcome.  Hoist on their own petard.  Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.  Be careful what you ask for; you might get it.Unfortunately, they may drag the rest of the country down into the fever swamp with them.</comment>

Eminent Domain didn’t stick to TRUMP and neither will groundless tax allegations. These cookie-cutter politicians and their obsolete old-boy establishment handlers are wrong for today’s challenges and tomorrows solutions. Please don’t waste voter’s time and energy trying to make this election about personalities, gender, race, minorities or hatred. Trust in the voters, stop insulting them. The odds are slim to none that other candidates will ever grasp this logic! It’s not complicated. It’s just requires common sense. Too bad common sense is in such short supply these days.Stop blaming TRUMP for other candidate’s and previous government failures. American voters couldn’t care less about party affiliations. Today American voters want to reverse the export of jobs, manufacturing and money out of America. Americans want a health care system that works for ALL Americans. Americans want to deal with terrorism and illegal immigration once and for all. Americans want the right leader with a vision that embraces measurable achievable solutions that focus on taking back America for ALL Americans. The political establishment’s endless disasters, at home and abroad, have failed Americans, not TRUMP. TRUMP will make America great again.On November the 8th the majority of voters will choose TRUMP as their next President. TRUMP surrounds himself with the right people for business and TRUMP will definitely surround himself with the right people as President.  As president, TRUMP will work very hard for ALL Americans repairing America’s domestic and international disasters caused by previous failed governments.</comment>

If you were really objective, you'd actually look into the factual basis of the allegation, would you not?Hence, you have proven my point. You really do have no clue what racism means if you think it's about "playing the race card" to manipulate a situation. Racism is about a system of beliefs and actions that center around one race being entitled to dominate and control or harm another. This includes feeling entitled to dismiss an entire race's description of their own experience as "phony."But racists are almost always unable to see that they are racists, because their defenses are too well developed.</comment>

They want the dignified working class jobs to stop going to China, and to stop competing with hardworking Mexicans willing to work for peanuts, for the dwindling number of remaining jobs.  They could care less if the guy who promises to stop these things on a policy-level  is a jerk in his own life.Although Trump's promises are vague and likely unrealistic, there is much more substance to this approach than to one involving polls sinking because of whom a candidate slept with or was rude to.  His supporters are into issues, not distractions.</comment>

m w::Friday, February 26, 2016 3:08 AM::<comment>"Since 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers there. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired.Inall but a handful of cases, Mar-a-Lago sought to fill the jobs with hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries."He has also sought guest workers at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and Trump National golf club and spa in Jupiter, as well as at his vineyard in Virginia and golf clubs in New Jersey"He prefers to hire Romanian guest workers.</comment>

Dr. Preobrazhensky::Friday, February 26, 2016 10:33 AM::<comment>Again, it's what he promises to do as president for the country rather than what he did in his own business that probably counts for voters.  He can always blame the system for his actions, and promise to change that system.</comment>

Daniel Richard::Thursday, February 25, 2016 9:55 PM::<comment>The only way Trump could get the nomination was to move to the GOP.  If he has stayed in the Democratic Party, he would never have gotten by Bernie.  Sorry people, 1 Percenters belong in the GOP, and that's why they keep losing elections just like Trump will lose in 2016</comment>

stmccrea::Friday, February 26, 2016 3:24 AM::<comment>Nothing wrong with being proud of being white, nor did I suggest there is. Nothing wrong with being proud of being black, either.But there IS something wrong with adopting policies and using rhetoric which identifies whites as more important and more deserving than darker-skinned people simply because they are white.</comment>
