Donald Trump: The Protector


Like many people, I have been wondering: What on Earth explains Donald Trump’s remarkable appeal to voters?I’ve come to the conclusion that the answer is fairly simple. The message of his Republican opponents has effectively been: We are more faithful to conservative principles. Trump’s message has been entirely different. He essentially says: I will protect you. I’m conservative, but if protecting you requires jettisoning conservative ideology, I will do so. Protecting you is the prime directive. This message has powerful resonance, especially for voters who feel the Republican Party has failed to protect their interests.You see this pattern in all of Trump’s deviations from conservative orthodoxy. Take the debate over Planned Parenthood. Like all conservatives, Trump opposes abortions. But he stresses he does not want to stop funding their wonderful work protecting women from cervical and breast cancer. The other Republican candidates simply express a desire to destroy Planned Parenthood outright. Trump’s message to voters: The other candidates will adhere rigidly to ideology, even if it needlessly fails to protect millions of women from cancer. I won’t.How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceOr consider the debate over Obamacare. Again, like all conservatives, Trump promises to repeal and replace it. But he stresses that he is not going to let poor people die because they lack access to health care. The other candidates say: Aha! Trump is not a purist opponent of government-funded health care. Neither Trump nor his opponents offer many specifics, but the message to voters is that at least Trump’s goal is to protect them from the financial burdens of Obamacare without sacrificing their health. His opponents suggest their goal is just the ideological purge of Obamacare, regardless of the health implications.On campaign financing, Trump’s message is basic: I am financing myself, so you can trust me to protect you because I will be beholden to no one other than the people who elected me. You can’t trust these other guys to protect you, no matter how good what they say might sound, because they will protect whoever paid for their campaigns. The other candidates, having pledged allegiance to the ideology of Citizens United, have no response and avoid the topic.Trump’s signature policy is to build a wall to protect his voters’ jobs. What could evoke protection more than building a huge wall? His opponents quibbled about its feasibility but ultimately adopted the same position. Trump’s message to voters: I care about protecting you enough to propose huge historic projects. The other candidates begrudgingly agreed, but their heart is not in it, so they are less likely to follow through.Free trade is great, Trump says, but it has to be fair. His opponents just adhere to pure free trade, which does increase the economic pie. But economic research shows that free trade harms some subsets of voters, particularly the working-class voters flocking to Trump. The message to his voters: I will favor free trade only to the extent that I can protect you from harm, perhaps by compensating you using the gains of trade. My opponents will favor free trade even if it harms you.Much the same goes for taxes and entitlements. Trump says he will cut taxes but not cut Medicare and Social Security, while the others favor cutting both. His message to voters: Only I value protecting your retirement benefits over tax cuts.Trump stresses how much he wants to spend on the military to keep Americans safe. But he loudly criticizes the Iraq War for costing many lives and dollars while making the world more dangerous, and he argues against repeating the mistake in Syria. The other candidates gasp, because he is violating the conservative ideology that the Iraq War was a noble cause, albeit misinformed, and they advocate further noble but bellicose strategies in Syria and elsewhere. Trump’s message to voters: I will use the military to protect us; the other candidates will use the military to advance ideological views about military honor, even if that sacrifices the lives of many of our soldiers for no discernible benefit.Trump even challenged the gospel of 9/11. In conservative ideology, 9/11 was a time of noble suffering, and all George W. Bush can get is credit for keeping us safe after it. Trump stresses instead that Bush didn’t keep thousands from dying on 9/11. The message: Honoring the fallen is no excuse for failing to protect us in the first place. Protection beats ideology, every time.The same message pervades his style. Trump talks endlessly about his polls, because the polls stress that he is strong enough to protect his voters. He speaks extemporaneously and often crassly in a stream-of-consciousness way, which has many pitfalls but emphasizes that his views are unprepared, authentic statements of his views and that he will thus carry out his promises to protect his audience. He responds aggressively to every attack, no matter how minor, conveying the sense that he will also aggressively protect his voters.All this explains why the prior Republican attacks on Trump’s positions and style have gone nowhere. It is not because he is a Teflon candidate. It is because, to his voters, these attacks have stressed what, to them, is Trump’s strength.The recent Rubio-led attacks on Trump have been more telling because their nature is different. These new attacks say, Trump is a con artist who will not protect you because he defrauded students at Trump University and hired foreigners over American workers. These attacks resonate more than prior attacks because they undermine Trump’s core claim that he will protect his voters.However, the Super Tuesday results indicate that these attacks have, so far, been ineffective. The likely reason is that, even if these attacks create doubts about whether Trump will follow through on promises to protect his voters, he remains the Republican candidate who at least says he values protecting them over adhering to ideology.To win over these voters, Trump’s opponents have to go beyond such attacks. They have to affirmatively explain just how they will protect the interests of Trump’s voters better than Trump would. They need to do something dramatic to emphasize their independence from moneyed interests, like vowing to use public financing in the general election and to seek the override of opinions like Citizens United. They need to lay out in detail how they are going to protect jobs, retirement benefits, and health care for the working class, rather than expecting voters to trust that adherence to Republican ideology will do so. They need to express military policies that are sensitive to protecting not only Americans’ security at home but also the lives of American soldiers abroad.They also need to stress that protection through a strong man has a dark side. Here, Trump has given them plenty of ammunition, like his suggestion that he would like to change constitutional law so he could use libel laws to suppress critique. Voters who crave protection must be directly confronted with a new question: If you empower a strong man to protect you, who is going to protect you from the protector?

Trump has already started to change his tune: he says "at this moment" he won't consider just legalizing millions of illegal aliens without deporting them first. Because Trump fans treat him like Bieber, they have nowhere to go. They aren't intellectually and emotionally capable of holding Trump accountable. Meanwhile, Trump faces pressures from the MSM and the elites to "moderate" his positions, which he will.All Trump fans should watch these videos of a smart, aggressive nationalist who doesn't engage in all the stupid things Trump does: imref.com/JMst9</comment>

Cyril Figgis Heisenberg::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:03 AM::<comment>All I see are Fascist traits with Trump, and how can you not?  Yet you mistake it for looking out for you and fighting against the enemies of the State. Trump is relying on every one of these traits to secure power and control everyone.  Wake up, or be doomed to the heel of fascism stomping on your throat.Powerful and Continuing Nationalism: Constant use of patriotic mottoes, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights: Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause: The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities;liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.Supremacy of the Military: Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.Rampant Sexism: The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusivelymale-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.Controlled Mass Media: Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.Obsession with National Security: Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.Religion and Government are Intertwined: Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric andterminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.Labor Power is Suppressed: Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts: Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to highereducation, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.Obsession with Crime and Punishment: Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.Rampant Cronyism and Corruption: Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.Fraudulent Elections: Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</comment>

The unions were a strong part of the Jacksonian segment from the late 1800s on--in fact, after 1968 they defected in large numbers from the Democratic Party to Wallace and Nixon--along with Jacksonians more generally.I think Trump will do very well in traditionally industrial/urban areas of West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, parts of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, etc.</comment>

Fred Garvin::Thursday, March 3, 2016 3:47 AM::<comment>Not at all well among the young tech workers. Maybe quite  well among those from older tech industries that have been outsourced, or H-1B'd, or individuals who have been aged out from being hirable (a very common occurrence).And those younger workers are a distinct and pretty small minority of the national population. One of the problems of the tech economy--I think the biggest--is that the number of "high" tech jobs created is tiny compared to the number of manufacturing jobs destroyed.</comment>

So, those immigrants have kids, born on US soil so citizens, and lots of them because they can't get access to family planning (defund planned parenthood NOW), who cannot be deported, and deny them good educations and adequate health care, so more kids, which changes demographics, so that as the angry white middle class and poor die off, the children of immigrants increase, and begin to outvote the poor whites.wake up.you are being hoist by your own petards.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:51 PM::<comment>I can understand the US punditry being baffled, but it's really a grainy rerun of the horror movie "Europe 1918-1939". Any Contemporanean European History grad should replace "the experts" on this one election cycle. If you sit down a Trump supporter, and just listen  without judging, you'll hear the same things the Italians, the Austrians, the Finns, the Hungarians, the Portuguese ,and of course, the Germans were saying. And pretty much none of them would describe themselves as Fascist. The traditional wisdom says you fend off the wings at a Primary and pivot to the Center at the General. Guess what ? There is no more Center. Those guys are voting in Trump and Sanders. Even now, the same thing is happening in Europe, but with one crucial difference, when a party like that raises it's head, all the others gang up on it immediately, like what happened in the local elections in France. The GOP took the German approach, "oh, we'll deal with him later", " oh, we need to consolidate", "oh, we can control him" . Yep, it's really the Stupid Party, alright !</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:31 PM::<comment>The rise of the Far-Right in Europe started in the 90's , as a reaction against the EU Burocracy. The Lehman meltdown gave it a lot of traction, just like the 1929 crash did. But again, in places who had a previous "experience" with Fascism, those parties rank lower, and countries that didn't, like France, or Belgium, or the Netherlands, they are a much bigger threat. But even so, there's a sort of "blood pact" between all the other parties, to do "whatever it takes" to fend them off. Translated to US politics, that would be GOP voters massively voting for a Dem candidate.</comment>

bdphd::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:11 PM::<comment>Actually, I think we'll see the same here--a new center-right candidate forming a new third party out of the ashes of the old, now tarnished, Republican party. But because we still have an essentially two-party system, that will translate into a Democratic win, at least for this election.</comment>

Américo Gonçalves::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:36 PM::<comment>Sorry to disagree, but there is no more Center. The people voting for Trump ARE the less conservative, less Evangelical portions of the GOP. The purists are going for Cruz. That leaves out a tiny slice for Rubio-Kasich, "Conservatism Classic". Can you see Ryan and McDonnell swallowing their pride and endorsing Cruz ? Me neither. It will be the Nationalists vs the Democrats.</comment>

CWB::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7:04 PM::<comment>Trump is a profligate liar, consummate self-promoter, and abully with NPD. Follow this link to hear what a real anti-establishmentconservative Republican Senator thinks based on Trump’s own words.https://www.facebook.com/sasse...The guy is a foul mouthed braggart and a fake Christian. Hemakes transparently impossible promises. His public speaking is at the elementaryschool level which I find insulting and demeaning. And his public speech isrife with racist, nativist and xenophobic statements.Julia Azari at 538 has a good question. There are two pathsfor #NeverTrump people: Is it more realistic to try to get to a one on onebetween Trump and a more ‘mainstream’ candidate, or for everyone to stay in andtries to prevent Trump from getting enough delegates to win prior to theconvention.A contested convention is every political junky and reporter/pundit’sdream. I think this is a very, very long shot. It is not impossible, but it’svery late, probably too late. This option doesn’t work in winner take all (oralmost) all states. Talk of a contested convention is just that, talk. And ifevery other candidate save one got out today, it is still too late to winoutright. The most likely scenario at this point is that Trump is the nominee.Move on.If you are really a #NeverTrump voter you have for choices:1) Vote for the Democrat. 2) Vote for any other candidate on the ballot orwrite in one of your choice. Or 3) don’t vote. All, at least to some extent, arefavorable to the D candidate (looks like Clinton), but 2 and 3 have the ‘virtue’of plausible deniability, the case that you not directly culpable if Trumpshould win: I didn’t vote for him.My wish is for the Republican Party to realign as aresponsible right of center party that has realistic policies to govern effectively,responsibly and fairly. Spin the hardcore militaristic, religious, and nativistnut-jobs off to some other party (Freedom/Tea, Nationalist, and Libertarian ona par with Independent, Socialist, Communist, and Labor parties).Early (very early) in our nation’s history there weren’t’political parties. They were thought (at least by governing elites) to be undesirableand a threat to democracy. Well sometimes they are all of that. But what’s thealternative?I think that most people are not wed to ideology whetherconservative or progressive. Here I speak of ideology and ideologues in thesame vein as fundamentalists and literalists. Yes, we accept the labels and weframe our politics as conservative, progressive and centrist. But a centristIMO is a pragmatic ideologue (forgive the oxymoron). We are conservative orprogressive until it doesn’t make sense, until the situation just feels reallywrong, until the expected consequences are bad, until the results of beingideologically pure are must worse than the results of compromise. In that sense,regardless of label, we become, a least to some degree, pragmatists andcentrists.The best case for not dismissing Trump out of hand is to chooseto believe that he has good intentions. To believe that his outrageous publicand political speech is all noble lies (gennaion pseudos) like the guardians ofPlato’s Republic who do great and benevolent things that the ignorant massescould not comprehend, so they must be dressed in lies to enlist the common man’sif not passionate at least willing support. The problem here is that if we areso ignorant to be misled by lies for our good, we are equally likely to bemisled to our disadvantage.How can anyone look at Trump’s present and past behavior andthink that he is a man of good character and strong conviction while thereasons to doubt are legion.</comment>

bdphd::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:05 PM::<comment>You could say this equally about Hillary, who talks about fighting for people and protecting people as much as Trump. Protection is a standard political pitch.No, Trump's message is simply that he will fight for the conservative working class and low-educated. His policies are all aimed at people with low levels of education, which is why a simplistic policy like building a wall has worked so well. He is a messenger of the disenfranchised, disempowered native white majority. Wall, trade, win. It's a simple message delivered by someone who speaks in uneducated terms.</comment>

In effect, the news agencies are not only marketing Trump's brand, they are also saving him millions of dollars in marketing and making him richer because more rich 1% customers will try his brand such as living in his vacation estates, etc.  SO, are you happy now that you and the corporate media and news agencies just made a REALITY TV STAR with ZERO government experience and ZERO foreign affairs experience  with 4 bankruptcies the next president of the USA?</comment>

T.C.::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:33 PM::<comment>The article is correct, but it fails to mention that popular objection to out-of-control immigration is a huge factor. GOP constituents have been flim-flammed on illegal immigration starting back in 1986. Reagan, Bush I & II heard their constituents object to out-of-control immigration, and flim-flammed them with talk of "immigration reform" which always materialized in amnesty if it materialized at all. The big bucks behind the "true conservative" agenda want the cheap exploitable labor. Trump has also gained support by offering to address the threat of terrorism by recognizing that it is is overwhelmingly associated with factions of Islam, and suggesting a policy to scrutinize immigrants who are associated with Islam and therefore part of the group from whence the problem springs.</comment>

sharpeshooter2::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:39 PM::<comment>Conservatives have long used immigration as a straw man issue to attract the low info conservative voter base, which has a long history of displaying and being attracted to bigotry. Even the terrorism issue was morphed into stopping refugees from coming into America. Trump simply used the tools that right wing Republicans have used for a generation, but he used them more skillfully.</comment>

Promises of food, warmth and security are more attractive than facing the reality of working for a living, paying for food, lodging and, yes taxes.Ironically, Trump challenges republican leadership to force it into the reality of modernity the majority of republicans will have to join democrats seeking Hilary as our savior from a disastrous Trump presidency.Trump also shows what happens when back-room politics keep competent republican  candidates from opportunities of leadership so that their favorites Bush, Cruz and Rubio are selected as their candidates for the white house.  Trump trumped their plan. </comment>

He appeals to the anger that mostly older white men feel towards Mexicans, women and other people of color taking jobs and changing our culture.  He says things many people think but wisely have chosen not to say out loud.People think he's a self made billionaire when his dad handed him the keys to the real estate empire.  They think he's smart, when he's mostly just rude.  They think he 'speaks his mind' and 'isnt politically correct' when most of what he says is unnecessarily insulting and mostly not true.  He speaks of grandiose ideas while leaving the implausible detals out, allowing everyone to fill those in the way they want to.  For example the "wall" that's already proven to be far more expensive than current estimates, which has been shown to be easily breached, add in the extra fact that the majority of illegal aliens come into the country on a legal visa and simply don't leave when it expires.That his followers tend to be well below average in education is also a telling point.</comment>

Trump has ZERO government experience. Why do you want a BILLIONAIRE in the government payroll? If Trump truly cares about the USA, then he will spend 4 years as mayor or Governor fixing Detroit & spend another 4 years as governor fixing Chicago. Otherwise, Trump (as a billionaire at the top 1%) is on the presidential ticket because he is POWER HUNGRY to change the laws to easily sue the press. He wants the business money & he is tapping into the taxpayers' money & make that flow as his lifetime government pension. He wants it all to himself (business money + government money + power to do any executive order). Be a mayor, then governor first then we will believe that he truly cares about the USA because Trump would have fixed the problems of Detroit and Chicago. Just watch all the full debates. All he does is insult everyone & be a troll. There is NO substance in his debates while the others discuss the issues seriously like scholars. Trump said it himself, "How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?" People actually believe his crap.All Trump did in his debates was shout out what he read in the news during the debates and people think he is making a point. The other candidates were scholarly and actually "discussed" the issues. The other candidates were forced to go down to Trump's middle school bully troll level so they could shut him up with his cheap shots.At the end of four years, Trump will be laughing his way to the bank with LIFETIME government pension while all of you are still poor with no progress and will be victims of his war.</comment>

Guest::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:53 PM::<comment>The Founding Fathers Fought Against Inequality. The government was created to get rid of the class warfare (rich vs poor).Thomas Jefferson wrote when visiting France:"I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. ... Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to TAX the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right."Alexander Hamilton argued for widespread ownership of assets, warning in 1782:"Whenever a discretionary power is lodged in any set of men over the property of their neighbors, they will abuse it."Hamilton argued that a strong middle class was needed to become energetic customers of businesses in the entire economy.John Adams feared that “monopolies of land” would destroy the nation and that an OLIGARCHY arising out of inequality would manipulate voters, creating “a system of subordination to all… The capricious will of one or a very few” dominating the rest.Adams wrote that – unless constrained – “the rich and the proud” would deploy economic and political power that “will destroy all the equality and liberty, with the consent and acclamations of the people themselves.” He therefore favored “preserving the balance of power on the side of equal liberty and public virtue (by making) … the acquisition of land easy to every member of society.”AND TRUMP IS THE OLIGARCHY THAT THE FOUNDING FOUNDERS ARE FIGHTING AGAINST. You are putting an oligarchy in the highest position of government? That oligarchy will further widen the gap between the rich and poor. Don't let the billionaire be a government employee, then collect LIFETIME government pension from the taxpayers after the 4 years is up. The billionaire knows that he will gain more for himself in the end with LIFETIME government pension benefits than what he puts in within the 4 years.</comment>

I tell my friends I'm much more concerned about a Cruz or even a Rubio presidency than a Trump presidency.  Is he a clown?  Sure.  But he's not an ideologue.  If it comes down to him and HRC, he's the one who doesn't want us stuck in the Syrian quagmire.  Who's the bigger fool?  I suspect there are other issues where he puts American interest ahead of ideology.

kathy_lowen::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:32 AM::<comment>Go tell that bit of "PC" to the GOP and conservatives, who routinely "stigmatize" just about everyone who "ain't like them" (welfare queens, ghetto thugs, the homa-sekchule agenda, femi-nazis, godless atheists, edumacated elites, Kalifornians, etc., etc.…)! Funny how y'all like to dish it out, but you can't take it!!</comment>

bsbechtel::Thursday, March 3, 2016 3:27 PM::<comment>Actually, I do, and GOP bad behavior still doesn't make your behavior ok, it just drives this country further apart. It also demonstrates you're no different than those you attack, even though you purport to be more educated.</comment>

ErikKengaard::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:44 PM::<comment>"The other candidates will adhere rigidly to ideology, even if it needlessly fails to protect millions of women from cancer. I won’t."" I am financing myself, so you can trust me to protect you because I will be beholden to no one other than the people who elected me. You can’t trust these other guys to protect you, no matter how good what they say might sound, because they will protect whoever paid for their campaigns. "Etc.Isn't that what many want in a president? Someone who is not an ideological extremist, right or left, but who would serve the interests of the middle class?All we really need to know is whether his actions will match his words.</comment>

Atman::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:09 PM::<comment>The author concludes, "To win over these voters, Trump’s opponents have to..."Mistake.  The Trump voters have made clear that they are absolutely impervious to facts, evidence, and reason.There is abundant evidence, available everywhere daily, of the low character, multiple business and personal failures, ideological incoherence and flip-flopping, and toxic narcissistic personality disorder of their hero.But as the Clown himself barked, he could stand in the middle of 5th Ave. and shoot random strangers and not lose a vote from his rage-engorged base.Cruz, Rubio, Clinton and anyone else who wants to save the republic from this comic-book Mussolini knockoff will need to concentrate on consolidating the votes of the other, more rational and decent 70% of the population.</comment>

B.J.D::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:11 PM::<comment>As opposed to our current dear leader using the IRS to do the same. You are all a bunch a whores and America doesn't give a flying f%&k what you think anymore.</comment>

BortzGinertz::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:11 PM::<comment>Good thing you don't speak for America.</comment>

B.J.D::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:17 PM::<comment>Well, we shall se come election time. My wife's family hasn't voted for a Republican for president ever. Almost all of them have Trump bumper stickers.</comment>

Atman::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:17 PM::<comment>Here's what annoys sane people about TrumpLogic:Point out one of the many obvious flaws in Trump's character or platform, and they respond with "But OBAMA!" or, more rarely, "But BUSH!"But that childish "I know you are but what am I?!" sort of response begs the obvious question:   If you really are outraged by the alleged anti-Constitutional actions of the current or previous Presidents, why on earth would you welcome more of the same??</comment>

BortzGinertz::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:20 PM::<comment>If I had to guess, it's a case of sauce for the goose, probably. You didn't actually think American conservatives (or at least Trump supporters) valued the Constitution, did you?</comment>

Atman::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:24 PM::<comment>That's it, I'm afraid.The Barking Ego-Clown promises to suppress free speech, to reinstate torture methods "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding", etc., and urges that peaceful protesters get "roughed up", but he'll only do it to "THOSE people".Hell of a basis for a democratic republic.</comment>

B.J.D::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:34 PM::<comment>This is a fun game, lets see if I can try.If you really are outraged by the alleged proposed anti-Constitutional actions of the presumptive GOP nominee, why on earth were you so silent about it when it happened before?I don't give a $hit about Trump's character or platform, I am a Ted Cruz guy. Don't get me wrong, if it comes down to it Ill vote for him over an 80 year old self professed commie or Hillary the crook. What I cant f-ing stand it the chattering classes going on and on about how we may elect the next Mussolini for flaws that are just as prevalent in their current lord messiah.</comment>

Atman::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:40 PM::<comment>Why do you presume I've been silent before?</comment>

BJOSEPHS::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:14 PM::<comment>With everyone but Trump the voters know they will get the same old thing, broken promises. The establishment only delivers for donors. With Trump there is at least a chance he will deliver on his promises; with the establishment zero chance.</comment>

KlugerRD::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:37 PM::<comment>"Protecting you is his prime directive"Protect? No. Control. Trump in his own company dictates and you had better agree with him.</comment>

Honey::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:44 PM::<comment>You got the message wrong. The average Republican is not looking to a govt figure to protect them or provide them with something or anything like that.It would be sufficient to just not get in our ways.We're not afraid of illegals. The laws are already on the books - don't pass something that will undermine us.Same with terrorists. I don't know anyone who is disrupting his/her life because of fear of terrorists. Use what we have to defeat them.</comment>

elastic jerk::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:56 PM::<comment>it is obvious that this terribly written and pointless article was published to smear Trump. no one agrees with everything Trump says or does, but some of the issues he speaks passionately about resonates deeply. you don't need an Ivy league degree to understand that. complicit and dishonest media! sad!</comment>

Jgury::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:57 PM::<comment>Hillary will wipe him out and they will lose both the house and senate. If the party allows this to happen they can only blame themselves for this debacle.</comment>
