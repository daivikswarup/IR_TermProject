A Frustrated Obama Returns to the 'Politics of Hope'


There was a moment in the middle of President Obama’s address to the Illinois state legislature on Wednesday when a look of fear briefly came over his face.Speaking to lawmakers with whom he used to serve, the president had been waxing nostalgic about his time as a state senator. Legislating in Springfield, as Obama described it, was nothing like the polarized Washington swamp. Sure, there was plenty of disagreement in Illinois, and the two parties debated the issues vigorously. But the political fights were civil. Republicans and Democrats played poker with each other, enjoyed rounds of golf together. They socialized. They didn’t call each other “idiots” or “fascists,” he said, “because then we would have to explain why we were playing poker with an idiot or a fascist who was trying to destroy America.”In the White House, Obama’s inability to change politics has become his greatest failure and, as he has conceded repeatedly, “one of my biggest regrets.” He had not, he told some of his former colleagues in Springfield, been able to close “the yawning gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics.”How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceBut everything was different in Illinois—or at least that’s how the president had remembered it when he left over a decade ago. Because as Obama was claiming credit for what he had accomplished in spite of all the partisan rancor, he saw that only the Democrats in the Illinois general assembly chamber were standing to applaud. The legislature was cleaving along party lines before his eyes, just like Congress does every year when he speaks in the Capitol.At first Obama smirked. “See, I didn’t want this to be a State of the Union speech where we have the standing up and the sitting down,” he interjected, drawing chuckles from the lawmakers. “C’mon guys, you know better than that,” he joked, pointing at his Democratic friends.But then instead of quieting down, the applause from Democrats grew louder, and cheers erupted. Now Obama was annoyed, and he looked momentarily afraid that he was losing control of the crowd. He put his hands up. “I’ve got a serious point to make here,” the president said. “I’ve got a serious point to make here, because this is part of the issue.”The members in the Illinois legislature were proving Obama’s point, and not in the way he wanted.This was intended as a grand homecoming for the president, coinciding with the ninth anniversary of the speech that launched his campaign for the White House. Joined by his close friends Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, and Senator Dick Durbin, Obama’s speech to the lawmakers and then a second one to supporters was part of a yearlong farewell tour of sorts that began with his State of the Union address. In returning to Springfield, the president was also returning to the place that had inspired his “politics of hope” message.He began his speech with inside jokes and friendly call-outs to members of both parties before turning to his assessment of politics in America. The address lasted over an hour, but by the end Obama had mostly said a lot of things he’s said in interviews, speeches, and press conferences throughout his tenure. He called for reducing “the corrosive influence of money in politics”; an end to gerrymandered congressional districts; same-day and automatic voter registration laws that make it easier, not harder, for citizens to cast ballots; and a greater commitment to civility in politics.Obama made only passing references to the presidential race, but it was hardly a coincidence that his call for civility came a day after the candidate of incivility, Donald Trump, had won a landslide victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary. “We can’t move forward if all we do is tear each other down,” he said. “We should insist on a higher form of discourse in our political life.” There were also lines that could have resonance in the Democratic race, as when Obama made a pitch for pragmatism and criticized groups in both parties who condemned compromise and demanded purity from their allies. (In a possible dig at Bernie Sanders, he knocked not only “union bashing” but also “corporate bashing.”) “That kind of politics means that the supporters will be perennially disappointed,” the president said. “It only adds to folks’ sense that the system is rigged. It’s one of the reasons why we see these big electoral swings every few years. It’s why people are so cynical.”Obama’s remarks drew kudos from government-reform advocates but a much harsher response from Republicans. “President Obama is uniquely unqualified to deliver this message and the Illinois legislature is uniquely unqualified to play host to a speech on bipartisanship,” complained Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican in Congress who served alongside Obama in the state Senate. “One thing in particular I’ve noticed about the president is his utter incapacity to be reflective about the weaknesses of his worldview.”Yet the most interesting dynamic in Obama’s speech was his continued frustration that the politicians he was addressing—these friends he was holding up as exemplars!—kept acting like politicians. He chastised the Republicans for cheering his call for gerrymandering reform in a state whose districts have been drawn by Democrats. And he tried in vain to stop Democrats from acting as his partisan cheerleaders. “Sit down, Democrats!” he snapped playfully at one point, sounding like a teacher scolding students he had riled up in the first place.It was all a little too symbolic at points, a president’s futile effort to keep a bunch of rowdy legislators in line. “One thing I’ve learned is that folks don’t change!” Obama ad-libbed when the lawmakers wouldn’t quiet down. In the moment, he was speaking of his former colleagues in Illinois, but it’s a sentiment the frustrated president could easily apply far more broadly than that.

About 20 million more Americans have health care due to the ACA. The TARP has been completely paid back, meaning the total cost to American taxpayer was zero. Finally, America is doing something about global warming. Thanks Obama!Not seeing the cliff, sorry.</comment>

isitjustme::Monday, February 15, 2016 8:23 PM::<comment>Every Obama policy has been anti business, anti growth. He has been aided by record deficit spending, quantitative easing by the fed and record low interest rates. Even with that growth has been tepid at best. The ACA has succeeding in raising healthcare costs for everyone except those who now get it as a gift from the tax payers. Global warming is a big 'so what'.</comment>

Terri Geer::Saturday, February 13, 2016 3:35 AM::<comment>So, you didn't actually pay any attention to all of the information on his background when he was running? His name was NEVER legally Barry Soetoro. However, like so many other step-children of the same era, he unofficially used his step-father's last name while his mother was married to him. But it was never legally changed.</comment>

Well, that never happened. Republicans made it perfectly clear from day one that they had no intention of working with him and have been true to their word no matter the cost to the country. So when people say they are disappointed with President Obama they should try working with obstructionist idiots who cared more about political games that doing what was right for the good of the country. I am proud of President Obama and what he has achieved even without the help of those useless pieces of crap in Congress. If they were in any other line of work shirking their duties as they have done they would have all been fired. Congress is an embarrassment to the country. Get paid good money with benefits for doing absolutely nothing of consequence and that in itself is a disgrace.</comment>

A_Packer::Friday, February 12, 2016 9:05 PM::<comment>I hear this all the time. People forget that his majority consisted of 58 Democratic and 2 Independent Senators, and this only lasted for roughly two months. Sen. Franken wasn't sworn in until the summer and Sen. Kennedy died 6 weeks later. In a Congress where filibustering has become the norm, he's votes short of passing any real legislation.This is why the ACA was passed through reconciliation and generated so much outrage for being undemocratic. Reconciliation votes can't be filibustered.</comment>

And the GOP/TP DID obstruct him and every other US citizen.When the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy were set to expire (remember that?) the GOP/TP refused to allow an extension to unemployment unless those tax cuts were made permanent. This was when we were still  struggling to get out of the mess that Bush left us.But the GOP/TP didn't care enough about the US to actually do well by it.</comment>

He showed no regard for Conservative thought or the Constitution, and his well-intended, Liberal agenda hurt the people he claimed it would help, as all well-intended, Liberal policies do.Now we can't even have a discussion because actual Socialist ideas and actual Trumpist ideas are being taken seriously, and subsequently worshiped by the dumb and unqualified.Obama's legacy will be mob rule and potentially even political violence.

He doesn't believe in Liberty. Our country was founded to limit the powers of government (the source of which is the consent of the governed) and to maximize the powers of the individual (the source of which is our "Creator"). He thinks it's his job to run our lives for us, but he's wrong. His job is to kill and punish people who harm Americans, and to leave us alone!"Educated" is not the right word. Liberals are schooled. They are taught what to think, and are given safe spaces to hide from the truth in. Liberals have completely hijacked the humanities because they aren't good enough to get real jobs. They can't produce anything people want to buy and are of no value to any employers. They are too lazy to achieve mastery in any academic disciplines, so they embrace post-modernism (participation trophy culture). They write some BS dissertations and eventually get tenure. Then they sit on their asses and tell kids about the world without ever having experienced it for themselves.And thank God for the Kochs. True patriots fighting for our Liberty every day. They are some of the kindest and most philanthropic people in America, and they employ 100,000 people at an average salary of $65k. They've donated $1.5 billion to various charities, museums, and arts centers. What have you ever done?Your God has never even had a job. He's a career politician. Every penny he owns was taken from taxpayers. He's a drain on society and should be flipping burgers like the lost generation of Communists he's cultivating. Post-millennials are going to outearn this generation by a staggering amount. I can't wait to see it.Your God won't straiten anything out. Rich people are smarter than him, and they will hide their money overseas. The poor will become poorer with fewer job opportunities, zero savings, terrible education, and no sense of responsibility.

We have Freedom of Speech, and we can participate in the political process. You don't get to rig the game in your favor.We are not a Democracy. We are a Constitutional Republic. We vote on who will represent us and defend our God-given Rights. We don't mob up like buffalo and push around the minority opinion.</comment>

TheSnorkeler::Saturday, February 13, 2016 4:52 AM::<comment>Common sense.Though the Liberal Seminaries, currently known as American universities, allow students to subjectively interpret what they read, every thinking person on the planet realizes that you are supposed to try to understand what the author means, not what it could mean out of context.Can you imagine if a small claims court judge decided to interpret laws his way instead of the way they were intended to be interpreted?</comment>

Jesse Taylor::Thursday, February 11, 2016 7:34 PM::<comment>Obama is a two bit hypocrite. All he did was rip Bush and the republicans apart blaming them for everything. His only accomplishments was to make this economy still suck and let his Muslim friends ISIS get away with murder more and more.</comment>

Terri Geer::Saturday, February 13, 2016 3:55 AM::<comment>No, he is not. The fact that over half the country elected him as President despite the bigots who fought with extremely dirty tactics are the ones who are responsible for dividing Americans and stirring unrest and resentment.</comment>

Heymaker::Thursday, February 11, 2016 9:44 PM::<comment>Obama is nostalgic for the 'Good Ol' Days' when the Democrats not only controlled the Illinois legislature, but the governorship as well. His memories might have been different had the Republican controlled one or both houses of the legislature.</comment>

PeterJakes::Thursday, February 11, 2016 9:50 PM::<comment>President Obama exacerbated the partisan divide rather than reduced it. Here was a politician who could not even reach out and work with Olympia Snow and Susan Collins! That shows he never really tried.</comment>

azt24::Thursday, February 11, 2016 10:57 PM::<comment>After hearing this crap for eight years, I have come to a very simple conclusion: Obama is delusional. He has this self-conception of himself as being the only adult in the room, the only reasonable man, that is just miles from the way he is perceived by everybody else, both his followers and his opponents.Obama is very, very partisan. So partisan that he is unable to engage with his opponents on the basis of ideas. Instead of contending with opposing ideas, he knocks down straw man versions of them. He cannot describe conservative ideas in any fashion that conservatives would acknowledge as their own. It's always "I want to solve this grave problem with some new government program, vs my opponents who want to do nothing" -- because his opponents don't want a new government program; they think it's a job for the private sector. But he can't imagine ever wanting to accomplish anything outside of the government. For Obama, the very purpose of rule is to increase government reach and power.Then he wonders why his opponents don't abandon their ideas and flock to him. He wonders why partisanship increases and civility declines.I'd tell Obama to look in the mirror, but I know all he sees there is an object of adoration.</comment>

channelclemente::Thursday, February 11, 2016 11:18 PM::<comment>I have a hunch that as this fractious group of Republican legislators ripens, you'll come to miss the logic of Obama's message, even if not the messenger.</comment>

VonKia::Thursday, February 11, 2016 11:28 PM::<comment>Obama never made an effort to work with Republicans and even with Congress in general.  From day one, his approach has been, "I'm right and you're wrong".Not only is Obama an ideological partisan but a narcissist who always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room and people who fail to agree with him deserve no consideration or respect.   This is why he can't understand why not everyone shares his point of view.  This is made worse by the fact that he's not a particularly smart or informed person. </comment>

past tense::Friday, February 12, 2016 12:52 AM::<comment>your comment is totally false; president obama's problem is that he spent *too* much time trying to "bring people together". when he was first elected, he had super majorities in both houses in congress; when he was pushing obamacare, he had no need to bother with republicans. instead, he spent too much time trying to offer olive branches to republicans thinking that he would "bring everyone together".what happened instead, is that the republicans took these offers as a sign of weakness. it became so ridiculous that republicans even withdrew support for legislation that the had previously sponsored once the president expressed support.</comment>

past tense::Friday, February 12, 2016 12:03 AM::<comment>i think that the biggest flaw in president obama's outlook on "compromise" is that he seems to believe in compromise is a way to avoid conflict; but the problem is that sometimes you have to have the conflict to get to the point where compromise is possible. wars typically end in some form of compromise - otherwise wars would be fought until one side was completely annihilated, and that generally happens. so the sides fight until they come to a realization that the costs of continued fighting are such that a compromise looks like the better way to go.when president obama came into office, it seemed that his approach was to look for "compromise" from day one. the problem was that the republicans weren't interested in compromise; they were interested in making the president look like a fool - and in the early years of president obama's administration, the republicans did unfortunately succeed in making the president look like a fool. this, coming from a person who considers himself to be a supporter of president obama.where bernie sanders has it right, in my view, is that you do have to have the conflict in order to change the system enough such that some form of compromise is possible. this is why the hillary clinton "democratic moderate" approach, won't work any better than it did when bill clinton was president.feel the bern...</comment>

u.r.tripping::Friday, February 12, 2016 2:40 AM::<comment>The system is rigged. Any criticism of President Obama's actions and you will be branded a racist. The system is rigged.</comment>

Aaron68::Friday, February 12, 2016 3:09 AM::<comment>9 years later, the President has still not figured out that politics is how Washington works, and to be successful, you need to be a good politician. He can market himself to the masses, but is utterly clueless when it comes to cutting deals and building alliances with other Washingtonians. Being the President is not enough to impress Senators and Representatives that have lived and worked in Washington for most of their adult lives.  Leadership requires respect, and respect must be earned. It is not a perk of holding the office.</comment>

ClausRasmussen::Friday, February 12, 2016 1:03 PM::<comment>I think the most damning testament to his "skills" as a politician is his relationship to the Democrats of Congress: He can't work with them either</comment>

future::Friday, February 12, 2016 4:03 PM::<comment>Obama has two major accomplishments.One is the Iran deal -- he avoided a new war and the possibility, one among many -- that humanity would nuke itself out of existence.The second was raising hopes that neither he nor the "free market" racket could fulfill.Now comes the hard part, the struggle over the real basics, not the old Republocrat con game.</comment>

Richard D::Saturday, February 13, 2016 10:10 PM::<comment>Obama's method has been, start in the middle and negotiate to the RIGHT. Republicans started WAY out on the right and stayed there. Not an effective way to govern if you are a progressive.</comment>
