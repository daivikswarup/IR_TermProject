The Senate Awaits Its Doomed Nominee 


Updated on February 16, 2016Within the next few weeks, President Obama will call up one of the nation’s top legal minds and initiate one of the trickier conversations of his presidency. He will offer him or her the honor of a lifetime—an appointment to the Supreme Court—and then he’ll share a caveat they already know: It’s a nomination that’s probably doomed from the start.Congratulations?That is one of the many awkward complications of the constitutional confrontation that has erupted in record time following the unexpected death on Saturday of Justice Antonin Scalia. Over the weekend, Senate Republicans up for reelection in 2016 largely fell in line behind Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s declaration that it should be “the next president” who appoints Scalia’s replacement on the high court. Their support dampens Democratic hopes that electoral pressure from Republicans in swing states would force McConnell to give Obama’s nominee a fair hearing and a floor vote in the several months.The president must now decide what kind of candidate to nominate. A centrist choice who has previously won Republican support and thus would be difficult for GOP senators to oppose? That could point to Sri Srinivasan, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge who was confirmed by a 97-0 vote just three years ago. Or it might point to another federal appellate judge in D.C., Merrick Garland, who has been singled out by Republicans in the past as the kind of consensus pick they could support.Yet knowing that Republicans would reject—or more likely, simply ignore—even the most unobjectionable nominee, Obama could go for a more liberal pick like Judges Patricia Ann Millett, who sits on the D.C. Circuit Court, or Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit. Both would add diversity to the high court and energize the Democratic base (Watford is African American), but both were also opposed by most conservatives when Obama appointed them to their current posts. The same is true of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, another rumored candidate.It’s also possible that none of these judges would actually want the nomination, realizing that they’d have to subject themselves to what amounts to a public colonoscopy with uncertain prospects of actually being confirmed to serve on the court. That’s why there’s speculation that a senator like Cory Booker of New Jersey or Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota could be Obama’s choice. Republicans might still refuse to confirm either Democrat, but as senators they are accustomed to scrutiny, and it’s more likely that their own colleagues would at least treat them gently on the way to a filibuster.At a press conference Tuesday afternoon in California, Obama offered few clues as to which way he was leaning other than to say he would nominate someone who was “indisputably qualified for the seat.” (He refused to take the bait when a reporter surmised from his words that he would go with “a moderate.” “No,” the president replied.) But as expected, Obama forcefully made the case that there was plenty of time for the Senate to consider and vote on a nominee, and he said there was “no unwritten law” that Supreme Court vacancies should only be filled in “off years.”“The Constitution is pretty clear on what should happen now,” the president said. “Historically, this has not been viewed as a question.” He said this debate was merely an extension of years worth of Senate slow-walking on judicial nominations to lower courts. “We’ve almost gotten accustomed to how obstructionist the Senate has become when it comes to nominations,” Obama said. He noted that the battles over judges often drew little notice outside the Beltway, but in a warning to Republicans, he promised this would be different: “This is the Supreme Court. It’s going to get some attention.”While Obama deliberated, the Senate descended into rather predictable charges of hypocrisy. Democrats accused McConnell and other top Republicans of disrespecting the president and willfully flouting their constitutional responsibility to provide “advice and consent” on a judicial nomination. “If my Republican colleagues proceed down this reckless path, they should know that this act alone will define their time in the majority,” Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, wrote in the Washington Post.Thinking otherwise is fantasy. If Republicans proceed, they will ensure that this Republican majority is remembered as the most nakedly partisan, obstructionist and irresponsible majority in history. All other impressions will be instantly and irretrievably swept away.Republicans have tried to suggest there is “an 80-year precedent” of the Senate not confirming Supreme Court nominees in an election year. In turn, Democrats point to the 98-0 vote installing Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice in 1988, in Ronald Reagan’s final year in office. But Republicans note that the vacancy that Kennedy filled actually occurred in the middle of 1987 and that the only reason a Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed him was that Reagan's previous two nominees—Robert Bork (rejected by the Senate) and Douglas Ginsburg (withdrew)—both failed.Conservatives have also highlighted a 2007 speech by Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader-in-waiting, who urged his party to block any potential Supreme Court nomination by George W. Bush in the final 18 months of his term. Schumer replied Tuesday in a post on Medium, writing that Republicans were “comparing apples to oranges” and that he was merely suggesting that Democrats “entertain voting no if the nominee [was] out of the mainstream.” He was not calling, he said, for Democrats to reject a Bush choice out of hand without a hearing or a vote.Obama also faced a question Tuesday about his vote as a senator to sustain a filibuster against Samuel Alito’s nomination to the high court in 2005. The president dodged the question and suggested that he, too, was voting politically; he noted that senators often vote to appease constituencies or for other “strategic reasons,” but he didn’t directly say whether that was his reason for opposing the conservative Alito.McConnell hasn’t explicitly ruled out allowing Obama’s nominee a hearing or even a vote; his only public statement since Scalia’s death said simply that “this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” Conservative activists are already mobilizing before Obama makes his pick, however, and they are concerned that GOP opposition will soften if the nominee is obviously qualified, potentially historic, or both. In the days since McConnell made his statement, Republican Senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have all backed him up and said Scalia’s replacement should wait until a new president takes office. All four are facing tough reelection battles this year.Two other centrist Republicans, Senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, issued more equivocal statements on a possible nomination. “In the past we’ve had a problem with certain Republican senators who are a little too eager to seem bipartisan right after a nominee is announced,” said Curt Levey, who as the former president of the Committee for Justice has been battling Supreme Court nominations for more than a decade. The group is now affiliated with FreedomWorks, and they are urging Republican senators to “keep their powder dry” when Obama makes his pick. “Don’t say anything,” he said Tuesday morning, summarizing his advice on a conference call with reporters. “When the time comes to have a vote or not have a vote, fine, but do not at this point talk about how you want to ‘work with the president’ and [say] ‘isn’t it wonderful that we have the first, you know, disabled female black nominee.’”The political strategy from conservatives is to argue against the nomination on process, not substance. Levey said Obama and the Senate “each have a constitutional role here. If the Senate decides that it doesn’t want to act, that’s as much within its constitutional role as Obama naming a nominee.” That decision could have ramifications in 2017 if a Democrat wins the presidency. A nominee who gets roughed up by Republicans now could be eliminated as a possible choice by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, who might not want to begin their terms with a difficult confirmation battle. But if conservatives stick to the procedural argument, then whoever Obama picks might become the frontrunner next year, almost a second running-mate for the Democratic nominee. And it could get more complicated still: Should Democrats win the Senate, Clinton or Sanders would be tempted to pick an even more liberal nominee, consigning Obama’s doomed selection to a footnote in history.All of which will likely make an awkward few months for whoever the president picks. “It’s an honor just to be nominated” might be an Oscar-season cliché. But this year it might sound most genuine coming from a distinguished federal judge.

lost in the stars::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:35 AM::<comment>That's the point of gallows humor. It is funny. The whole last year of a term issue is nonsense. This Senate would have done the same thing in 2015.A Republican-majority Senate hasn't confirmed a Democratic president's Supreme Court nominee since Harry Truman picked Sherman Minton in 1949. Democratic-majority Senates have approved nominations by Republican presidents fourteen times since then, the last time in 1991. National politics has gotten much nastier since then.Edit: True enough, RealityCheck. I'd have to go back to Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson to find pre-Truman Dem. Pres./Rep. Senate splits.</comment>

National politics has gotten much nastier since then.There were only eight years in that time frame where a Republican controlled senate and Democratic presidency coincided, all of them since 1995, and during these eight years, the president never actually nominated anyone for the Supreme Court.So, you could with equal truthfulness say that a Republican Senate hasn't rejected a candidate proposed by a Democratic president since the Buchanan administration.Meanwhile, during the time frame you proposed, the Democrat controlled senate rejected Clement Haynsworth, G. Harold Carswell and Robert Bork, and helped give us the notoriously ugly Clarence Thomas hearings.  If the Democrats have tough fight of this, it's not like they haven't been asking for it.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:00 AM::<comment>It's not only that the Democrats led the way by turning "Bork" into a verb, it is liberals who turned the judiciary into a third political branch.If the Supreme Court merely vetted laws for Constitutionality, the political leanings of justices would not matter all that much. But since the 60s, the courts have rewriting the Constitution from the bench to make it say what they think it ought to say, regardless of what it actually says, legal precedent, or the expressed will of the voters. This is always at the behest of liberals.</comment>

It supported the historical interpretation.It did not stop a state recount. It stopped the gameplaying by Democrat lawyers trying to recount Democrat strongholds. Gore should have demanded a full recount, which was in the rules.  What Gore did, was  not.  And Bush won in the actual recounts done by multiple newspapers, hoping to embarrass him.As for the War on Terror and Drugs..... judges from different ideologies have ruled problematically.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:08 PM::<comment>It is the very fact that Democrat leaning activist judges and Justices used the bench to write, that scared Democrats when faced with an originalist like Bork.Fortunately for the country, they took the borking so far, that the country was repulsed by what happened What happened to Thomas a few years later was a smaller Borking, but a borking nonetheless.Conservatives have memories.</comment>

The progressives stepped up their politicization of the nominations process, two steps beyond what they did with Haynesworth, Carswell, Bork, Thomas.

The 4 current democrat appointed justices vote like robots, actually they are more accurate than robots who occasionally will do unpredictable things, its the conservative justices who will occasionally vote against their predicted ideology, which by the way ALL justices are supposed to do .  There are way to many things on which a 5-4 liberal majority will do mass scale changes with 100% certainty, let American voters decide that in Nov if that's what they want. Love the concern trolling among press and liberals, the voter turnout among conservative voters in swing states of upper midwest with all those 5-4 rulings on the horizon will meet or exceed the turnout of liberal voters.</comment>

George::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:24 AM::<comment>I do agree turnout will be high, but recently, high turnout helps the left, while low turnout and voter suppression helps the right. It will be an interesting race. I just think the rules should be the same for both parties.</comment>

A_Packer::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:39 AM::<comment>I seem to remember great fear of required IDs from conservatives about 15 years ago. They conjured specters of police stopping people and asking, "Papers, please."Does it strike anyone else as odd that this has completely evaporated when it comes to deciding who gets to vote? Suddenly, it's absurd that everyone wouldn't have a government issued ID, and requiring you to pay for one is the most reasonable request.</comment>

jhp151::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:45 AM::<comment>Conservatives already lost the ID infringement battle in the area of gun ownership and as such generally consider the ID requirement to be the new default standard.  EG You need ID to buy a gun you should need ID to vote.  I concur that if ID is a requirement to use any constitutional right the ID should be free.</comment>

S deKay::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:51 AM::<comment>It depends what you mean by ID.  The problem is photo ID.  If for instance paid utility bills at a residence were accepted, very few if any legitimate voters be disqualified.  However, depending on the state 10-20% of eligible voters lack photo ID.  Those voters tend to belong to one or more of the following categories:  the young, the elderly, minorities and the poor. Since photo ID laws tend to be passed in states under Republican control and most of the legitimate voters who are excluded under these laws tend to vote for Democrats, the suspicion arises that these are really intended for voter suppression particularly as the ethnic groups growing as a percent of the population, Latino and Asian, have been recently voting heavily Democratic.  This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the kind of voter fraud prevented by ID laws is rare on the order of .000005 percent or less.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:19 AM::<comment>Every Photo ID law I know of includes a free state-issued ID with an affidavit. It doesn't matter. Dems scream racist voter suppression anyway, regardless of the law. The PA law took nine forms of ID plus a free state-issued ID. Dems ran to court and got a stay anyway.But there can be no doubt that Photo ID laws do suppress Dem voters -- the illegal aliens, the felons, the union members bused in to impersonate someone else, the cemeteries.Apparently these groups of voters are regarded as vital by the Democratic Party. Otherwise they wouldn't put themselves on the wrong side of an issue that is supported 75/25 by the public.</comment>

Mr. Fusion::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 10:47 PM::<comment>Every Photo ID law I know of includes a free state-issued ID with an affidavit.Nope Nadine is caught lying again. Several require payment. Some require payment to obtain the documentation. Some require one present themselves at a specific place at certain times; often once/wk or even mth.</comment>

S deKay::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 11:09 PM::<comment>I have not seen any report that all photo ID laws have a state issued ID;  many reports only describe what other IDs.  Also there is the issue of how the availability of the state issued ID.  If the only offices issuing them are many miles away and only open for a few hours on weekdays, it is hard for someone with a job and without a drivers license to pick one up.  Also see Mr. Fusion's post below.Felons who have paid their debt to society are allowed to vote in some states.  Otherwise the behavior you are describing occurred more than 75 years ago.  You need to show that it is occurring to any measurable extent today.Public opinion polls don't always show that the public supports the right side of an issue.  Had public opinion polls existed in the 1830s the abolition of slavery would have had the support of much less than 25% of the population.It is very interesting that these laws have been passed only in the last few years although their supporters never claim that voter fraud is more common than 10 years ago.</comment>

jhp151::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:03 PM::<comment>The new standard is the ID must  identify the individual in some way.  Utility bills do not do this.  Take the example of roommates.  The bill can be in the name of any one individual but all the roommates could easily use it as identification.  This is much harder with picture ID.Concerning the amount of in person voter fraud being exceedingly low, I do not think most conservative voters care.  Again using the gun issue, the amount of people murdered with legally purchased guns is far smaller (as a percentage of the total US population) than the percentage of in person voter fraud, however this does not seem stop gun control advocates from attempting additional restrictions.</comment>

Mr. Fusion::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 10:49 PM::<comment>I didn't know that utility bills were not all in a single person's name. So how could Jane smith use Erin Jone's electric bill as ID?</comment>

jhp151::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 11:12 PM::<comment>If Jane Smith lives with Erin Jone's  (eg roommate example) she could just show up with the utility bill.  Without a picture there is no way to distinguish that Erin is not Jane.  It could even be an honest mistake on Erin's part if she was informed that she just needed the utility bill from her place of residence.</comment>

S deKay::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 11:53 PM::<comment>I meant to use utility bills as an example not sufficient to identify everyone.  The bill is to an individual and that individual can present the bill as evidence of his or her ID without needing a photograph ID.  I agree with your second paragraph.  It reinforces my belief that the sole purpose is voter suppression as I discussed in more detail in my earlier post.</comment>

jhp151::Thursday, February 18, 2016 1:08 AM::<comment>Not voter suppression per se.  More that the standard for something being good enough to not tinker with has become 'near perfection' for several issues.</comment>

S deKay::Thursday, February 18, 2016 4:38 AM::<comment>What they used in the past and at different times I've voted in 4 states in every part of the country except the South is a good enough standard.   You may not want to call it voter suppression but under the photo ID laws a substantial number of eligible voters who are predominantly Democratic voters lose their votes and it amounts to that de facto.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Thursday, February 18, 2016 4:44 AM::<comment>You'll have to prove that Voter ID laws target democrats.</comment>

S deKay::Thursday, February 18, 2016 5:26 AM::<comment>Wait until the next election and interview those who were not permitted to vote because they lacked photo ID and voted regularly in the past.  Meanwhile, it's a good educated guess that they will be predominantly Democrats.  The  studies that have been done have identified characteristics of people who are more likely to vote Democratic.  They include the young, minorities and the poor although some may fall in more than one of these categories.  I suggest you contact Professor Richard Hasen of the University of Irvine Law School the most recognized expert on voting and the Brennan Center for Justice if you don't believe what I have just written.</comment>

cargosquid::Thursday, February 18, 2016 9:43 AM::<comment>I grew up in New Orleans. Voter fraud is rampant, just unproven.  Vans filled with people voting for $5 for each vote used to drive around town and even made the local news once.  Many districts in the last Presidential election reported more votes counted than were registered. I support voter ID because showing my ID protects my right to vote.</comment>

S deKay::Thursday, February 18, 2016 10:10 AM::<comment>Thanks for the information.  How recently did the vans drive around?  I notice you did not claim that it was still going on.  I'm not sure what you mean by districts.  Did you mean congressional districts, legislative districts, precincts or what?  Please provide the registration figures and total vote figures for the districts (whatever they are) where the latter exceeded the former.  Thanks.  In any event Romney carried the state by more than 300,000 votes so any such illegal activity had no practical effect.I don't object to ID which any legitimate voter would have but photo ID which substantial numbers of legitimate voters do not for reasons beyond their control.  I believe the right to vote is sacred and should not be taken away.  During the Civil Rights era a number of people died to obtain that right.</comment>

Some of them are tyrannical and there is no next election.Hitler was elected.Stalin was "technically" elected but I don't count it as real.Wilson was elected. He didn't kill millions, but he was the closet thing to a fascist that we've had.Carpet bombing is a valid military tactic. He was using hyperbole since it isn't necessary. Cruz's point is that if we are in a conflict...and Obama HAS entered us into another conflict, the only proper response is to win the damn war.  As we speak, while we have total control of the air, we allow ISIS to move about freely.  That's one of the problems.  Either win the war or don't get involved.</comment>

S deKay::Monday, February 22, 2016 2:57 AM::<comment>Unlike you I think it's unlikely that we'll have a dictatorship in this country.  Even Nixon didn't try to cancel elections and he was the only one who voiced the theory that whatever the President did was legal because he was the President.  If a war is stupid winning it is not possible.  Vietnam proved that.  However your comments about Cruz and winning a war show that the person you are likely to vote for is more likely to kill people.Your comment about Wilson being the closest thing to a fascist that we ever had is interesting.  He certainly was a racist. and we had a loss of civil liberties with the Red Scare of 1919, but at that time he was disabled with a stroke and we didn't have the 25th Amendment so his wife was really running the country.  His vice president refused to take over and was legally correct.  Please explain more fully.</comment>

We could have won Vietnam at any given moment, but the liberals decided that they did not want us to win.</comment>

S deKay::Monday, February 22, 2016 7:21 AM::<comment>We could not have won Vietnam.  It was a political struggle and our opponent was the George Washington of his country.

S deKay::Monday, February 22, 2016 11:39 AM::<comment>First I heard of this.  I googled effectiveness of bombing and there were a number of reports that the bombing did not prevent North Vietnam from supplying the NLF and that like most bombed populations such as Europeans in WWII bombing improved the morale of the North Vietnamese.

S deKay::Monday, February 22, 2016 11:21 PM::<comment>Thanks for the information which enabled me to find that there was an interview in 1996 of Giap with CNN.  In it he attributed their military victory to the Vietnamese courage, determination, wisdom, tactics, intelligence and sacrifices along with American ignorance of Vietnam and the Vietnamese but he said nothing about his side being about to give up before US protestors and news media changed the course of the war.  Snopes has rated this claim false.</comment>

John Crawford::Monday, February 22, 2016 9:21 PM::<comment>Whatever you googled gave you inaccurate information.  We did not bomb the North Vietnamese population.  Our politicians limited bombing to troop areas, and to very carefully selected military targets only.  Naturally, such bombings did still result in some civilian deaths.  But no deliberate bombing of civilian targets was done.  Had we actually bombed the NV infrastructure and population centers, its likely they would have been unable to formally surrender.Semper fi</comment>

S deKay::Monday, February 22, 2016 11:48 PM::<comment>Sorry if you misunderstood.  None of the sources went into where the bombs were supposed to go.  Of course it made sense and was true at the time as far as intent goes.  But even drones which are much more accurate occasionally kill civilians in addition to the terrorists so it is not surprising that there were people killed and injured and non-military property damaged and destroyed.  Since as you say we did not deliberately bomb infrastructure and property centers we will never know what the effect would have been regardless of what you believe.  However, in WWII in 1940 the Germans bombed British population centers and British morale rose.  Later in WWII the Allies saturation bombed Germany including infrastructure and population centers and historians tell us German morale rose.</comment>

John Crawford::Tuesday, February 23, 2016 1:04 AM::<comment>Drones don't kill anyone.  It is the controllers at the other end of the communication line that kill.  British morale rose.  German morale dropped when their cities were bombed, until the end.Semper fi</comment>

Attila Iskander::Saturday, February 20, 2016 1:37 AM::<comment>1) You can also kill yourself and others with a knife. And for the millenia before guns were around, knives were the weapon of choice for doing that. And even today, knives are still very popular and the primary tool when guns are not available. (Rwanda anyone ?)And yet no one is asking for ID to purchase knives..2) And right after knives we have clubs. Same historical use, even longer than knives.And yet no one is asking for ID to purchase clubs of any kind.3) As to elections, I wonder how many people all over the world, and not just the US died because elections were skewed by voter fraud..You want to start controlling guns, change the 2nd Amendment.But until you do stop trying to come up with excuses to infringe of the right of people to keep and bear arms for their defense.</comment>

S deKay::Saturday, February 20, 2016 1:57 AM::<comment>1 and 2 are irrelevant  The answer to #3 with regard to US elections (We are not discussing foreign elections.)  is 0.  I am assuming that only Presidential elections can lead to that kind of effect as individuals members of either house of Congress by themselves do not have enough influence and neither do individual state and local officials.  There are 2 Presidential elections 1876 and 2000 that were close enough to be potentially influenced by fraud but the 1876 election did not result in a war and if there were fraud in deciding the 2000 election which resulted in more than 4000 American deaths alone it was not the kind of fraud that could be prevented by photo ID.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Saturday, February 20, 2016 3:29 AM::<comment>Clearly, you have a problem with logic and rational argument.So let's make it real simple for you..1) Guns are arms2) The right to arms is protected by the 2nd Amendment. And that right is NOT contingent on being in a militia.The dicta of "shall not be infringed" is an absolute one that does NOT contain any "but" or "except for" in it.3) To require people to jump through hoops to "keep and bear arms" which also includes acquiring said arms, is an infringement which is forbidden by the 2nd Amendment.4) You also show a double standard in trying to justify infringement on one type of arm, and not for others that have a long history of use predating guns, AND are still in use today.---------------Regarding electionsPresidential elections are ONLY ONE of MANY elections that include1 President and members of Congress at the Federal level2) Governor members of Legislatures and Courts at the State level3) Mayors, Commissioners, Magistrates and a whole slew of other elected posts at the local level.ALL of the above elections can be and most likely have been affected by election fraudWhen one counts all the possible examples of electoral fraud at all levels, to fixate solely on Presidential elections, demonstrates a very, very narrow perspective---------------------------Ironically, most of the election fraud recorded and documented in recent times  has been on the Democrat side of the fence.And in the 2000 election, the MOST glaring attempt at fraud, was in Florida when Al Gore and an Florida Supreme Court tried to illegally and unconstitutionally modify the electoral rules regarding recounts.------------------------Bottom line.There is NO EXCUSE for even one person, of ANY political leaning to have their vote annuled by a fraudulent vote.There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON, NOT to have records verification to prevent ineligible people from voting illegally.The vary fact that multiple electoral districts have been found to have up to 150% more ballots cast than there are residents, not eligible voters, but RESIDENTS, in a district, is clear evidence that there is a problem with identifying who is qualified to vote in that district, and not in another.</comment>

S deKay::Saturday, February 20, 2016 5:35 AM::<comment>You seem to have a problem with reading comprehension.  You asked how many people in the world not just in the US died because elections were skewed because of voter fraud.  This obviously refers to military action abroad.  While there are all the offices you list that are elected,terms of causing deaths in the world not just the US, state and local offices cannot cause them nor can individual members of the House of Representatives or Senate.  Only a President could for example Bush 43 in Iran. As I mentioned there were only 2 elections for President that were close enough for a possible voter fraud to influence the outcome.  In one of them there was no military intervention abroad.  That leaves the 2000 election where there was military action abroad and thousands of deaths as a consequence.You have alleged fraud in the Florida Supreme Court and the Gore campaign asking for different rules for recording recounts.  Others have alleged fraud in the US Supreme Court intervening to prevent recounts however conducted.  Still others have alleged fraud in the Republican Secretary of State disqualifying voters as alleged felons using a program that the creators said was flawed simply because they had the same name as a felon.  These and others such as the infamous butterfly ballots are disputed in each case as to whether that constituted fraud, but even if all of them constituted fraud that alleged fraud could not have been prevented by what was under discussion the use of photo ID laws.  That is why I answered 0.Your points about the Second Amendment and gun buying are not relevant to a discussion about whether eligible voters are prevented from voting by photo ID laws.  We are not discussing whether gun users without mental illness who are not criminals are prevented from buying guns.Thank you for clarifying that you meant by districts election districts which are usually called precincts.  I am unaware of any precincts where the total vote exceeded by 50% the number of residents but I am willing to look up the data if you can provide enough information for me to look it up.  We need to know the date of the election, the office (I guess you are talking about votes for President in 2012 but I don't know this for sure) the state(s) involved, and enough information to identify the "election districts" to which you refer by specific location.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Friday, February 19, 2016 1:05 PM::<comment>Let's make this real simple1) Guns qualify as "arms"2) The 2nd protects the right of people to arms. Specifically ",, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"3) "to keep arms" and to "bear arms" first requires that you own those arms. Ergo the process of arming onself is also not infringeable.Thank you for playing</comment>

S deKay::Friday, February 19, 2016 11:19 PM::<comment>This is all a non-sequitur.  The discussion is about voting.  By the way you've left out part of the wording of the Second Amendment.  At the time there was not a standing army which was why a militia was needed.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Saturday, February 20, 2016 1:47 AM::<comment>1) Clearly you have NO CLUE as to what a non sequitur is.All I did was point out the double standard.You want ID to exercise the RKBAYou don't want ID to exercise the right to vote.DOUBLE STANDARD..2) The KEY part of the 2nd Amendment is the RKBA:".. the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."The first part is a "justificatory clause", It's sole purpose is to give a reason for the State NOT to infringe.That the State chooses not to have a "well regulated militia" in NO WAY diminishes the RKBAAnd the reason I left it out is simpleIt has ABSOLUTELY NO bearing, and in NO WAY restricts the RKBA(I hope that I was clear enough for you).</comment>

S deKay::Saturday, February 20, 2016 2:05 AM::<comment>Please reread your last paragraph.  You are making the same claim that I am when I write that bringing the second amendment into a discussion of people losing their right to vote as a result of photo ID laws.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Saturday, February 20, 2016 3:47 AM::<comment>No, I am NOT making the same claimI am pointing out the hypocritical double standard YOU have enunciated by claiming that it's an infringement on voting rights to expect ID to show you have the right to vote, while claiming it is NOT an infringement to demand ID to exercise the right to keep (and purchase) and bear arms.Good for the Goose is good for the ganderThere is NO real evidence to show that people "lost their right to vote" due to voter ID laws.If anything they chose NOT to exercise their right to vote, by not insuring that they were registered to vote.For example, I am legally entitled to vote in 3 countries because of multiple citizenships.And in 2 cases there is NO REQUIREMENT of residency to vote.But UNLESS, I do not go to the trouble of registering for the next election, I effectively cede my right to vote by default.That is NOT the same as "losing the right to vote".And to claim so is a lie.</comment>

S deKay::Saturday, February 20, 2016 5:58 AM::<comment>Since we're ostensibly discussing photo ID laws that is why buying guns is a non-sequitur.  Many if not most states and I have at different times voted in 4 of them do not require annual registration.  Once you meet the requirements for registration you are permanently registered unless you die or move or by repeatedly not voting are purged from the rolls.  So these voters are already registered but because they lack photo ID are not allowed to vote.</comment>

jhp151::Friday, February 19, 2016 7:45 PM::<comment>I am countering your claim that Heller changes 200+ years of jurisprudence.  Heller codified the Second Amendment as an individual right but it did not overrule pre-existing case law.  In Presser v Illinois (1886) the court ruled that the second amendment granted an individual right but that laws restricting government control of such right only applied to the Federal Government and not to State Governments.  The next SJC case was United States v Miller (1939) which made no ruling on an individual right followed by DC v Heller (2008).Concerning local restrictions of Constitutional rights (incorporation doctrine).  That legal standard changed independent of SJC second amendment case law.</comment>

cargosquid::Thursday, February 18, 2016 2:39 AM::<comment>Actually, yes it was. And various judges stated it was so. See Cruikshank. See Taney's pronouncement on the right to keep and carry arms in Dred Scott. See the Framers and Founders writings.NO jurisprudence made it a collective right. It was merely not enforced on the states because of the idiotic incorporation philosophy pushed by the courts.</comment>

Mr. Fusion::Friday, February 19, 2016 6:11 PM::<comment>Well, I guess you don't know what Cruikshank was about then. It specifically stated that firearms could be regulated by the local jurisdiction.

cargosquid::Friday, February 19, 2016 6:39 PM::<comment>You might want to research that a bit more.the Justices held that the Second Amendment restricts only the powers of the national government, and that it does not restrict private citizens from denying other citizens the right to keep and bear arms, or any other right in the Bill of Rights. The Justices held that the right of the people to keep and bear arms exists, and that it is a right that exists without the Constitution granting such a right, by stating "Neither is it [the right to keep and bear arms] in any manner dependent upon that instrument [the Constitution] for its existence."It held that the right cannot be affected by the government. At the time, the 2nd had not been incorporated.  It held that the limitations on government are not restrictions on private action.</comment>

But seriously, it doesn't matter how the Voter ID law is written, how many forms of ID it accepts, how easy it makes it to get a free state-issued ID.Without fail, the Dems scream, "Racist Voter Suppression!" anyway. And then they run to court with a bag of made up numbers to get a stay. Their favorite ploy is to wave around the Voter Roll Total less the Drivers License Total to claim "500,000 voters will be disenfranchised!!!!" or whatever the number is. The media repeats the claim like a stenographer.What the media don't point out is that drivers license rolls are kept up to date, but the voter rolls are not. The voter rolls are full of the names of people who have died or moved out of state long ago. (Those names can come in real handy in close elections, doncha know) So the 500,000 number is bogus, a database artifact. But that doesn't matter when you've got the media on your side, and a few handy liberal judges to issue a stay.</comment>

Tulse::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:27 PM::<comment>How many instances of voter impersonation fraud have there been in recent years?  And how many legitimate voters have been disenfranchised by voter ID laws?  I am willing to bet that the latter number vastly outweighs the former.  There simply is no major problem, and the "solution" distorts the actual will of the voting public far more so than that alleged issue itself.And let's be clear -- various Republican have explicitly said that voter ID laws are intended to reduce voting in poor and minority groups.In an ideal world, where states work vigorously to ensure that all its citizens have voter ID provided for free and without substantive barriers to obtaining it, I wouldn't object.  But that is not what we have.  State offices that provide non-driver ID are often open very short hours, in relatively few locations, and can be nearly impossible to get to for those who are working jobs that don't provide time off.So voter ID laws are an alleged solution to a problem that really doesn't exist, and are actually intended to disenfranchise groups that the Republicans don't want voting.  It's pretty straightforward.</comment>

Mr. Fusion::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 10:57 PM::<comment>Still wrong. Texas charges $16 for the voter ID. More if you need to find a birth certificate.</comment>

Adrian::Thursday, February 18, 2016 7:13 AM::<comment>The incidence of in-person voter fraud, which is the only thing voter ID laws protect against, is exceedingly low. Somewhere on the order of 0.0001% or so. Also, you may have noticed that the voter IDs accepted are not only inconsistent, but also often tend to favor conservatives. College ID? No way--too likely to be a liberal. Hunting license? Sure thing--likely to belong to conservatives! Meanwhile, Ohio doesn't accept US passports, which are one of the only IDs which prove both identity AND citizenship. Why not accept them? Using a fraudulent passport is a crime in and of itself, not to mention the additional crime of voter fraud.If you're concerned about election fraud, worry about insecure voting machines. Worry about disenfranchising eligible voters. Worry about simultaneously requiring, say, a driver's license or state ID, while also closing DMV offices, making it harder to obtain the very ID they're requiring. And, if in-person voter fraud is such a concern to conservatives, it ought to be something worth spending some money on, like paying to provide every single eligible voter with a valid ID. Put your money where your mouth is. That would show that you actually, sincerely care about, and that it's not about disenfranchising eligible Democrat/liberal/progressive voters who are likely to be unable to afford the IDs.</comment>

Adrian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:08 AM::<comment>Yeah, you try convincing all the militiamen, right-wing conspiracy theorists, etc., that the government should be allowed to, what, scan their irises?

Adrian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:01 AM::<comment>Americans already decided in 2012 that we wanted Pres. Obama to be the person nominating to fill judicial vacancies. Any and all vacancies, through the end of 2016. Since when do Presidents only get to exercise their presidential powers for three of the four years in a term?</comment>

indocon::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 4:23 AM::<comment>And they gave Republicans biggest congressional majorities in 2014 since 1950's</comment>

Adrian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:18 AM::<comment>That may be, but my statement still stands. There's still the issue that the President, in this case, President Obama, is the President, and is obligated to nominate someone to fill the vacancy. The Senate doesn't have to confirm his nominee, but they should be expected to hold the hearings and put the person to a vote, so they can be held to account if the nominee is qualified.So, to say that the President can't, or shouldn't, even nominate a candidate to fill the vacancy, is to ignore his constitutional duties. The Senate's duty is to give advice and consent. That's AND, meaning  both. It doesn't say advice OR consent. So, for instance, Sen. Cruz saying that the Senate is fulfilling its duties by advising the President that his nominee, whoever that may end up being, won't be confirmed, is just plain wrong. It meets neither the letter nor the spirit of the clause. So, not only are certain people saying that the President can't fulfill his constitutional duties, but they are also advocating that the Senate abdicate its constitutional duties as well.</comment>

indocon::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 7:09 AM::<comment>They should hold the hearings and vote, that most people will agree on.</comment>

Adrian::Thursday, February 18, 2016 6:24 AM::<comment>Well, except those who don't. For instance, Sen. Cruz. And anyone saying they'll hold the hearings and votes, but won't confirm anyone, is basically saying they'll hold the hearings and votes in bad faith, at which point why even bother? Not holding hearing and votes, in good faith, is basically the same as refusing to hold them in the first place, and ought to be treated the same, both by voters, and by the Democrats.</comment>

Terry::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 7:57 AM::<comment>you're a bit off on the wording of the appointments clause and it matters.It does not say that the senate will give advise and consent, it says that the appointment is made with the advise and consent of the Senate.In other words, without the advise and consent of the senate, there is no appointment.  If they do nothing, they are fulfilling their duty,</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 4:38 PM::<comment>Just a nitpickThe wording is "with, and by"Which in fact is an even stronger definition that puts the Senate in full veto power mode if it so chooses.In effect, the President proposes, the Senate disposes.</comment>

Adrian::Thursday, February 18, 2016 6:57 AM::<comment>Well, fair enough, but, to that same point, those saying Pres. Obama can't, or shouldn't, nominate an appointment are doing the same, or worse.ConstitutionThat's not permissive language; it's mandatory. He shall nominate, and he shall appoint Supreme Court judges. He's obligated to do so, by the Constitution conservatives so claim to know and love. There's no conditional clause, saying "unless it's an election year." It also doesn't allow the Senate to withhold its advice. Consent, obviously, must be able to be withheld, otherwise it's meaningless. But I think a strong argument can be made that they're obligated to put their consent to a vote; that they can't just say they won't consent, but have to actually withhold their consent. They should put their consent (or lack thereof) on the record, so they can be held to account by the voters.</comment>

Terry::Thursday, February 18, 2016 8:35 AM::<comment>Sorry but this is well understood Constitutional law and tradition, most recently SCOTUS unanimously agreed that the Senate is under no obligation to consent to nominees even when by holding them up, the function of the NLRB could not be performed because it lacked a quorum.See National Labor Relations Board v. Noel CanningLikewise, the President cannot be forced to nominate (again common understanding).You are missing the logic that the founders used in putting this together and need to realize that there is a balance of power between the three co-equal branches that makes it nearly impossible for one branch to force another to do  anything.  It is working the way it was intended to.BTW the politics around it is also fine, they all know that the President can nominate anyone, any time he wants, Obama knows that he cannot force a vote or a hearing, they can all say what they want.Obama was fine with filibustering Alito, Shumer told Bush a year and a half before his term was up that he wasn't doing any more Judges.  It's just politics.</comment>

Adrian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:57 AM::<comment>One can only hope. I think the GOP is in a tough spot with this. They obviously don't want to let Obama appoint a new justice, but leaving a vacancy hurts them in the meantime (both as far as judicial decisions, as well as politically, by making them look like partisan obstructionists), and also could turn out the Democratic vote in November. And they could end up with an even more liberal nominee if Clinton, or especially Sanders, ends up being elected. Plus, the GOP will have set the precedent that it's ok to block Supreme Court nominations during an election year, and it will come back to bite them. It's not a question of if, but when.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 9:05 AM::<comment>I don't think the GOP needs to worry about the concern-trolling of the New York Times. Activist liberal judges who think they are a permanent ad-hoc Constitutional Convention are a burning issue with conservatives.Obama will make what political hay he can of this, but Ted Cruz will make more.</comment>

Adrian::Thursday, February 18, 2016 7:50 AM::<comment>And conservatives will be punished at the polls for this, too. Even many conservatives acknowledge that the President has the right and duty to nominate an appointee, and the necessity of having a full complement of justices on the Supreme Court. I have conservative friends who recognize the peril you're putting yourselves in with this tactic. They'd rather have moderate Obama appointee Justice so-and-so, and maybe have a shot at President Republican, than end up with President Democrat and extremely-liberal President Democrat Justice so-and-so.Not only that, but keeping the vacancy open hurts conservatives in the short term: any close decisions which end up in a tie will let the lower court's ruling stand, and most of the circuits lean liberal. Basically, you'll win almost nothing at the Supreme Court level, and will lose a lot. Anything with a decisive win (5-3 or better) wouldn't have been changed by allowing an appointment anyway, because, at worst, it would've been 5-4, which wouldn't change the outcome. Ties break for Democrats in like 9 of the circuits. And it will only pay off for you if you win both the White House and keep the Senate, which becomes less likely the longer they delay, and even more so if they reject an obviously qualified nominee.So, you'll most likely end up cutting off your nose to spite your face, rejecting a moderate Obama nominee, and ending up with an even more liberal Clinton or Sanders nominee, and likely lacking the power to block the nominee from being confirmed. And, even if you do, you can't just keep the vacancy open indefinitely. Like I said, ties don't really resolve any issues. Different regions of the country, under different Circuits, will have different binding law, and circuit splits won't be able to be resolved unless by a 5-3 decision or better. Refuse to fill a Clinton or Sanders appointment, and you'll be punished even more heavily in the 2018 midterms, resulting in an even more liberal appointee. Oh, and while all that is going on, there are three other Justices likely to retire or die before 2024, with at least one, and maybe two, likely before 2020. In the extreme, you lose Kennedy, the swing vote, who gets replaced by a liberal. RBG and Breyer are both liberal, and will be replaced by liberals, too. Then, you'll be left with only Thomas, Alito, and Roberts, so you'll only win if two of the liberal justices can be convinced to vote their way. And all the most senior justices, and probably oldest justices, will all be conservatives, so you'll have to hope you control the White House and Senate so that Thomas can retire, or in case he dies.Not to mention, all these shenanigans are screwing over the country for partisan reasons. You won't win any moderates, and won't get any liberal defectors. But, what will happen is, you'll alienate your own base, who, the longer you drag this on, will become less and less likely to support your obstructionist efforts. The longer it goes on, and the more and bigger wins by the Democrats, the stronger the mandate to nominate and confirm a very liberal Scalia replacement. And, the minute there's a Democrat majority in the Senate, you run the risk of losing the filibuster, in which case you end up with the most liberal justice the 50th least liberal Senator can be convinced to support.You may win the battle (though that's not even a given), but you'll lose the war, and you will have brought it upon yourselves. And then the GOP voters will punish you for having so thoroughly wrongly having read the situation and f*cking them over. So, on second thought, just go for it.</comment>

Lay aside right and wrong for a moment, and look simply at whether the candidate supports your side or not. Scalia was our guy, and there's no way we're going to see him replaced with one of your guys without a fight. We wouldn't expect anything less from you if you were in our shoes.Now, add to that the nasty hearings for Bork and Thomas, and you might get a sense for why Republicans don't really care how Democrats feel about this. We'll give you Kagan and Sotomayor; we don't always agree with them, but they're competent and don't seem evil. But try to fill Scalia's seat with Lynch? Yeah, that's going to be war.</comment>

FireWraith::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:28 AM::<comment>Just keep in mind - that was never how the Constitution was supposed to work.

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 11:12 AM::<comment>Defamation, really?  what did Joe and Ted say about his positions that were untrue?In any case, you and other Republicans are welcome to commit your own scurrilous campaign of character assassination against whoever Obama nominates.  That kind of thing is expected really, particularly from Republicans.  But simply refusing to even consider any nominee on any terms , leaving a seat vacant for the next 13-15 months, is irresponsible.  And again demonstrates Republicans have no actual interest in governance, only point scoring.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 12:40 PM::<comment>Oh, that Bork would see to it that women would be dying in alleyways across the country, but he didn't care because he was a horrible mean conservative who hated women? Stuff like that.As for leaving the seat vacant, it's been done before -- the seat Bork was supposed to fill was vacant for almost a year. In fact, the GOP can do nothing in this case for which Harry Reid has not set ample precedent. Reid sat on Bush's nominations for years, starting in 2001.</comment>

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:05 PM::<comment>Bork would have overturned Roe allowing abortion to be made illegal again, leading to illegal and unsafe abortions, just like happens in every other country where abortions are illegal.  Again, what is the lie?  That Bork wanted it that way?  What is the lie in judging a man by the results he encompasses.Bork's seat was vacant for a year because Reagan attempted to put a doctrinaire right wing conservative in it, was rejected, and then had to go to a second choice, Kennedy, who was unanimously confirmed if I remember correctly.And according to statistics, Republicans are blockading all judicial nominees at an ununpredecented rate.  Which is immaterial because there is no precedent, at all, for refusing to even consider a president's nomination for the Supreme Court which even you, in your partisan fervor, would admit I think is different from a lower court position.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:28 PM::<comment>So just because Bork thought the Courts shouldn't go around pulling newly invented Constitutional rights out their backsides, based on nothing but a desired result (esp. the right to commit what fully half the population regards as infanticide), that justifies defaming him as a killer who hates women?Spoken like typical progressive. Means always justify ends for you lot.</comment>

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:16 PM::<comment>And this from somebody who justifies the means (complete abandonment of the Senate's constitutional responsibility to advise on a nomination) based on an end - getting a justice they fully agree with on every doctrinal point.  Yeesh.As for Bork - He opposed Roe.  If Roe is overturned there will be more illegal abortions.  if he helped overturned Roe he is then responsible in part for those illegal and unsafe abortions.  What part of that equation is difficult for you to comprehend?I recall in 1970 a referendum on abortion in Washington state.  On one side of the campaign were people with pictures of babies, all of them born.  On the other side were people with pictures of coat hangers.  I asked my mother why the coat hangers.  She told me.By the way, I doubt you consider abortion infanticide as I doubt you will advocate publicly for prosecuting doctors and women as murderers.  But perhaps you do.  The Handmaid's Tale is pretty popular in some quarters.</comment>

English grammar is not your strong suit, is it?As for the future, given that the current Republican demand, pretty much unanimous is that they would only deign to even consider confirming a Justice just like Scalia, who hated Roe, predictions about the future are also pretty safe regarding any nominee Republicans would confirm.</comment>

MacCheerful::Thursday, February 18, 2016 4:29 PM::<comment>There you go, using the term as a verb.Anyway, if, as you argue so repeatedly, it would be impossible to tell beforehand how Bork would have voted on any particular issue, because his testimony in Senate hearings and his prior writings would apparently be no guide, what difference does it make that some people said something mean about him 30 years ago?  If the consequences of his being voted down are some imponderable mystery why hold the grudge?It's like you saw somebody kick a puppy in 1984 and somehow the memory still haunts you.Oh, and since we have somehow strayed back into a substantive discussion of Bork (Thanks!  I was starting to wonder where this was headed)  can you remind me, again, what is it that the Democrats said about him that was inaccurate?</comment>

Attila Iskander::Thursday, February 18, 2016 4:52 PM::<comment>There you go being ignorant againhttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki...The biggest problem most people like you have is the conflation of a person's personal views and that of their "professional" views.Do you have ANY data to show that Bork ever stepped over the line in his legal judgments and tried to impose his personal views into those judgments ?I'm willing to be that there is ABSOLUTELY NO such evidence.Or even a suggestion of such evidence, EXCEPT in the minds of people like you who do NOT grasp that it is possible to make a separation between professional (ex legal) opinions relating to law, and personal opinions relating to those same laws.Scalia is a perfect example of that, where in some decisions, the went with the law and NOT his personal opinions, because he was acting as a judge and not an individual citizen.Far too many on the left presumes that since they are NOT able to make that separation, it follows that no one else is.They, and you  are wrong.</comment>

MacCheerful::Thursday, February 18, 2016 4:59 PM::<comment>Imagine for a moment that I am too busy to chase down your wiki and select one example of Somebody accusing Bork of something inaccurate.I have read Kennedy's speech.  He described, accurately, the results of Bork's substantive legal position, which seems like a good reason to vote against him.Or are you arguing that a judicial nominee's substantive legal positions, his view that Roe was wrongly decided, that Brown v. Board contained legal errors, that the 9th Amendment is the rough equivalent of an ink blot and there is no such thing as a right to privacy - is it your position that a Senator should not consider such things in a vote?Scalia's personal opinions, by the way, riddled his decisions. You might take a look at Posner's recent writing on that point. But he was pretty good at pretending otherwise.So you still leave me at a loss as to what the great crime of the Borking actually was.  Rejecting a nominee based on their substantive legal views?  Isn't that what the Republican party is happy to do today, except that they have decided that anybody nominated by a Democrat will ipso facto have repellent views, as opposed to hearing them out.?Or is the great crime of Borking saying mean things about somebody to make a point.  Well, that is a terrible thing.  I am glad Republicans never do it.</comment>

MacCheerful::Thursday, February 18, 2016 5:06 PM::<comment>But was it inaccurate?And do you agree that the 9th Amendment was the rough equivalent of an ink blot and there is no right to privacy?</comment>

Attila Iskander::Thursday, February 18, 2016 5:15 PM::<comment>Do you even know the meaning of the word "smear" ?As I wrote, since you don't even get that, further discussion is pointless.</comment>

MacCheerful::Thursday, February 18, 2016 5:47 PM::<comment>Sure, a smear is an inaccurate statement regarding someone for the purpose of discrediting them.  To this point you have yet to point out something said about Bork that was in accurate.Of course you may have your own definition of smear, something along the line so saying something accurate but harsh about somebody.  That doesn't seem to be the mainstream understanding, but perhaps is how it's translated in whatever is your native language.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:55 PM::<comment>Well, you see that's where the Republicans differ from the Democrats.Instead of mounting a scurrilous campaign of defamation, all they intend to do is sit on their hands and do nothing.A far more elegant solution, that will also make any potential nominees think about wasting their time a la Miguel Estrada.</comment>

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:58 PM::<comment>Remind me, what was defamatory about the statements made about Bork?  If he had become justice instead of Kennedy women would be having illegal abortions, and some would be dying, and same sex couples would still not be able to get married.And note this "campaign of defamation" did not actually prevent an up or down vote in the Senate, where 5 Republican senators voted against Bork.As for the elegance of the Republicans refusing to actually govern by sitting on their hands and doing nothing - well only another Republican would apparently find that somehow a responsible thing for adults to do who swore an oath to defend the Constitution.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 7:45 PM::<comment>YAWN !Idiots swallowing the FUD of their masters is boring.There is NOTHING in the Constitution that can force the Senate to even consider a candidate put up by the PresidentUnfortunately for you, recent actions by the Democrats set that precedent.Now you're going to reap what you sowed.Deal with it.</comment>

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:17 PM::<comment>so you got nothing vis a vis Bork being defamed.And being butt hurt about Bork for over 30 some years has got to be a record in butt hurtness.  You guys cling to God guns and grievances but not in that order.And there are no recent actions by Democrats refusing to consider Supreme Court nominees.And if you want to prattle on about lower court nominees consider that since January 2015 the Senate has approved exactly one, and that was only after Toomey begged McConnell to relent.  Currently the door is now closed on the Senate doing anything so responsible as helping to fill judicial vacancies.You guys hate government.  You also hate governance. And payback is the only ethical principle you honor.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:31 PM::<comment>Read what teddy kennedy had to say immediately after Bork was nominated.Easily found on the web.  Go see the wiki in Bork.The rest of your screed is just stupid ideological diarrhea.</comment>

MacCheerful::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 8:34 PM::<comment>I've read the speech. Point to me something in it that is inaccurate.And of course, invective.  You really don't have much else.  Apparently the worst thing to happen in politics ever was 30 years ago when somebody said something mean about Bork.</comment>

mfw13::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:35 AM::<comment>Fine. But at least Bork & Thomas got hearings. Right now, the GOP is refusing to even fulfill its Constitutional duty by giving the nominee a proper hearing.</comment>

Bill Santagata::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:45 AM::<comment>Not only was Bork extremely conservative, he was also involved in the Watergate scandal. Still, the Democratic Senate never told Reagan that they would flat out refuse to consider any nominee he put forward. They gave him a confirmation hearing and ultimately appointed a moderate.No one expects Obama to get another Ginsburg on the Court; but he should at least be given the decency and respect as President of the United States to get a hearing and up-and-down vote for his nominee.</comment>

Toxteth O'Grady::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:48 AM::<comment>Instead of laying aside right and wrong, how about laying aside left and right.</comment>

Darrell Imaginarian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:07 AM::<comment>The Democratic Senate confirmed Scalia in the first place.  Only one party pursues power through the lens of nihilistic Machiavellianism.</comment>

SlapHappyDude::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:12 AM::<comment>I suppose it's like Miers vs. Roberts.</comment>

Jeff G::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:29 AM::<comment>Scalia was the most ideologically extreme conservative justice in the last 100 years at least, but was confirmed unanimously by a Democratically controlled Senate. </comment>

JillinNYC::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:50 AM::<comment>Yes, because George HW Bush was so respectful by giving us a scowling, silent, robotic ideologue of questionable character as a replacement for civil rights hero Thurgood Marshall.  Uh yeah.</comment>

Erik Lonnrot::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 5:56 AM::<comment>My fear is that you represent a reasonable strain of conservatism that isn't going to carry the day in an election year. If the roles were reversed I would want the senate to approve a qualified nominee but reject an unqualified one. I have a feeling that a not insignificant number of republican senators would define "unqualified" as nominated by a democratic president. Supreme court appointments should be above petty tribalism (from both sides). When you have senators saying that they'll oppose any nominee they are failing to live up to their constitutional responsibilities. As the article points out, there is no guarantee that republicans will have more leverage after the election than they do now.</comment>

azt24::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 9:09 AM::<comment>If the roles were reversed there is zero chance a GOP nominee would go through, especially to replace a liberal judge. A Democratic Senate might refuse to act, or they might Bork the nominee. But no way in hell would they approve him or her, no matter how qualified.</comment>

Hunterst::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 6:50 AM::<comment>This post sums up why political appointments to courts is a bad idea in general I think.</comment>

Attila Iskander::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 4:13 PM::<comment>The fillibuster of Miguel Estrada for 2 years has set a nice precedent, for the Senate to sit on it's hands and do nothing.</comment>

Damascusdean::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:38 AM::<comment>It won't be different except they will have a majority block. Elections do have consequences.</comment>

SlapHappyDude::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:11 AM::<comment>Actually the Conservatives were a more reliable bloc than the liberals, with Anthony Kennedy providing a legitimate moderate swing vote. It was very rare for Scalia-Alito-Thomas to break rank from each other, with Roberts occasionally taking his own path.A second moderate would certainly complicate things, but also of course tilt the scales more towards the liberal side of things.</comment>

BobbyBarker::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:01 AM::<comment>So have the conservative justices.   Your point?</comment>

AnnieOMG::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:33 AM::<comment>Republicans know full well had it been one of their own in the White House and this happened they would have had a justice nominated within days! No way would they wait until the next president was elected especially with over a year still left in office. They would have cried bloody murder had Democrats disrespected Justice Scalia like they did before the poor mans body was even cold before they started playing political games. It really is shameful but I expected nothing less of them. They did the exact same thing over Benghazi. Use the deaths of four people to raise money. The party of no shame, it's disgraceful behavior.</comment>

Adrian::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:19 AM::<comment>They may very well have just made a recess appointment, since the Senate was on recess when Scalia died, and still is.</comment>

mfw13::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:34 AM::<comment>The Republicans made a serious and huge political error by coming our within hours of Scalia's death and saying that they would refuse to even fulfill their Constitutional duty and grant the nominee a proper hearing and vote. Just makes them look like unreasonable idiots, and will seriously hurt them in close races throughout the year.They could have accomplished the exact same objective (i.e. denying an Obama nominee a place on the Supreme Court) by being polite and granting Obama's nominee a proper and full hearing and then voting him or her down on party lines (since the GOP holds a majority in the Senate).</comment>

Bill Hornbeck::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:41 AM::<comment>That will happen if Obama does nominate a replacement and the GOP wins the election</comment>

mfw13::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:56 AM::<comment>Yes. But being so unreasonable is going to hurt them so badly politically (especially in swing states) that they not only will have no chance at winning the presidential election, but also are increasingly likely to lose control of the Senate as well.Huge political miscalculation....</comment>

Bill Hornbeck::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 3:18 PM::<comment>Democrats aren't motivated to vote by SCOTUS nominations, it will be a much bigger is motivator on the Republican side.</comment>

SlapHappyDude::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:02 AM::<comment>I think it's a tactical error, but not a huge one. The average American swing voter doesn't care a lot about the Supreme court. Their main objective right now is keeping their base mobilized and engaged (and donating money for the General Election).Realistically Mark Kirk is going to have to break from his party if he wants a prayer of winning re-election, and behind the scenes I imagine he'll have the party's blessing as long as he does so quietly. With 54 votes, the Republicans have the luxury of letting a couple of their vulnerable members look reasonable.Bottom line, I'm not sure how much the average swing voter cares if the Republicans delay a vote to fill a Supreme Court seat.</comment>

wjca::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 2:14 AM::<comment>The average swing voter might not have cared about a Supreme Court nomination.  But having made it a big issue, the GOP can't count on the usual level of indifference.</comment>

Terry::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 7:45 AM::<comment>there is no constitutional duty to grant the nominee a proper hearing and vote, that is made up.</comment>

Damascusdean::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:36 AM::<comment>If Republicans had half a brain among them, they would welcome a moderate nominee by Obama. They would then drag the hearings out until well into the fall election, and if it looked like Hil or Bernie was going to be the next president and/or Republicans were going to lose the Senate majority, they would confirm the moderate choice.But they seem to lack anything other than the brainstem.</comment>

Bill Hornbeck::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:39 AM::<comment>I think that's exactly what will happen. These will be the longest hearings ever</comment>

Phranqlin::Wednesday, February 17, 2016 1:52 AM::<comment>Yup.  All that they're doing is making it more likely that President Hillary will nominate former president Barack Obama to fill Scalia's seat.</comment>
