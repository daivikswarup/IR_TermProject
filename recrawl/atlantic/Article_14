A Changing Latino Electorate 


Donald Trump walked away from the Nevada Republican caucuses with a victory—and a new talking point for the campaign trail. CNN’s entrance polls found that 8 percent of caucus goers were Latino—and that 45 percent of them backed the real-estate mogul. The two Cuban American senators also seeking the Republican nomination trailed far behind. “You know what I am really happy about? I've been saying it for a long time: 46 percent with Hispanics, number one with Hispanics,” Trump exulted.Latinos also made up 19 percent of Democratic caucus goers. The entrance polls showed Sanders appearing to take the lead among Latinos, coming out eight points ahead of Clinton. Shortly after the results rolled in, the Sanders camp sent a release to reporters titled “Sanders Wins Latino Vote in Nevada.”Both boasts proved problematic. Edison Research, which conducted the Nevada entrance polls, interviewed people at 25 polling places across the state. Like other such polls, it’s subject to selection biases and problems with its sample sizes, which grow more acute for smaller subgroups like Latino voters. And an analysis by Nate Cohn at The New York Times found that in areas of Nevada where there was a greater concentration of Latinos, Clinton took the vote—strongly suggesting that the Democratic entrance poll got it backward.But one thing Nevada clearly showed was that no candidate could afford to take Latino support for granted.The first two contests of the race were in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are predominantly white states. The Republican primary in South Carolina similarly featured an electorate that was 96 percent white. The candidates are now facing a Latino electorate, that will factor significantly into both contests, and again in November. In Nevada, Latino voters, who comprised just 5 percent of Republican voters in 2012, were back up to their 2008 level of 8 percent on Tuesday night.The NALEO Educational Fund projects a 17 percent increase in Latino voter turnout for the general election—a nearly 9 percent jump from 2012. That bump reflects an electorate with a new swath of Millennials, who make up 44 percent of Latino eligible voters expected in 2016. The median age of U.S.-born Latinos is 19, according to the Pew Research Center. Univision, a Spanish-language news outlet, is working to encourage increased voter turnout through a series of initiatives, like advertisements on their video and digital platforms, according to a New York Times report. Several states lie ahead where Latino voters could prove decisive, particularly Texas and Colorado, where they make up a large portion of the population.On the Democratic side, Sanders will try to ramp up support among minorities by appealing to Millennials in an effort to close in on Clinton, who has fared well with Latinos and African Americans. In Nevada, Sanders did particularly well among Latinos younger than 45, garnering 70 percent of their support versus Clinton’s 27 percent. For Republicans, renewed efforts to court Latinos are also likely as the primary progresses into states like Texas. But if Nevada provides any lesson, it’s that Cruz and Rubio can’t just bank on their on Cuban heritage to win Latino voters.In 2012, 71 percent of Latinos backed Obama, and just 27 percent favored Mitt Romney. With their share of the electorate projected to increase this November, all the candidates will be trying their best to win them over.

They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”'</comment>

They are likely to remain alienated and blame outside factors like the same factors that kept them down in Mexico: racism, exclusion, discrimination, lack of social cohesion..."More than any other factor, Telles and Ortiz said, education accounted for the slow assimilation of Mexican Americans in most social dimensions. The low educational levels of Mexican Americans have impeded most other types of integration."Their limited schooling locks many of them into a future of low socioeconomic status," they said. "Low levels of education also predict lower rates of intermarriage, a weaker American identity, and a lower likelihood of registering to vote and voting."Second-, third- and fourth-generation Mexican Americans speak English fluently, and most prefer American music. They are increasingly Protestant, and some may even vote for a Republican candidate.However, many Mexican Americans in these later generations do not graduate from college, and they continue to live in majority Hispanic neighborhoods. Most marry other Hispanics and think of themselves as "Mexican" or "Mexican American."…The study's authors, UCLA sociologists Edward E. Telles and Vilma Ortiz, examined various markers of integration among Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas, including educational attainment, economic advancement, English and Spanish proficiency, residential integration, intermarriage, ethnic identity and political involvement.Key findings from "Generations of Exclusion" include:• The educational levels of second-generation Mexican Americans improved dramatically. But the third and fourth generations failed to surpass, and to some extent fell behind, the educational level of the second generation. Moreover, the educational levels of all Mexican Americans still lag behind the national average.• Economic status improved from the first to second generation but stalled in the third and fourth generation. Earnings, occupational status and homeownership were still alarmingly low for later generations. Low levels of schooling among Mexican Americans were the main reason for lower income, occupational status and other indicators of socioeconomic status.• Adult Mexican Americans in the third and fourth generation lived in more segregated neighborhoods than they did as youths. This was due to the high number of Latinos and immigrants moving into these neighborhoods, the researchers said.• Most Mexican Americans identified as "Mexican" or "Mexican American," even into the fourth generation. Only about 10 percent identified as "American." Moreover, many Mexican Americans felt their ethnicity was very important and many said they would like to pass it along to their children.• Among Hispanic 16- to 24-year-olds in the United States, 17.6 percent were high school dropouts in 2009, compared with 9.3 percent of African-Americans and 5.2 percent of whites in the same age group, although the rate for Hispanics has steadily improved, according to The Condition of Education 2011, published by the U.S. Department of Education.♦ EDWeek.org♦ Barbara A.

Marlene J Looney::Thursday, February 25, 2016 4:04 AM::<comment>I'm Cuban American and will not be voting for Cruz or Rubio. If you believe that folks of Latin American origin will vote for someone sharing the same language but not similar views, you are not well informed on this very diverse (not monolithic) group.   Frankly, most Latinos for well founded and not well founded reasons don't particularly like Cubans.  I could bore you with specifics.Stone Soup:  don't understand your premise that Hispanic citizens are more disenfranchised by immigration. Yes, a significant percentage of undocumented may come from Latin America but not all. And many of us "Hispanics" as we are collectively called but frankly do not identify with, are highly educated (Bachelos, Masters, PhDs, etc) and do not "compete" for the low wage jobs that these folks are willing to take since most US natives feel to far above to do (like pick the vegetables that end up at your dinner table).To Redneck sensei:  There may be Latinos who support Trump but I highly doubt your reason.  One of the reasons that you "Dial 1 for English and 2 for Spanish" is because unlike the waves of immigrants from Europe in the 1880s-1920s, Latinos do bring their country of origin with them. They do not discard their identities; instead they fuse their origins with their new land.  Many do not want to leave their homelands. They leave for economic reasons and faithfully send their earnings from their meager wages to family back home.   Let me know how many of us you truly know.Finally, to Beelzebub:  only people that insult others in the fashion you have employed do so because by putting others below you gives you the perception that you are above. Your caps demonstrate your anger and your choice of epitaphs demonstrates your degree of ignorance. </comment>

You do not represent most Hispanic voters who vote with the tribe against imaginary or real external enemies.This is by the Pew Hispanic Research Center, pro illegal data: Educational attainment. Mexicans have lower levels of education than the Hispanic population overall. Some 10% of Mexicans ages 25 and older—compared with 13% of all U.S. Hispanics—have obtained at least a bachelor’s degree. Mexicans born in the U.S. are almost three times more likely to have earned a bachelor’s degree than those born in Mexico—15% vs. 6% respectively. About six-in-ten Mexican immigrants have not earned a high school diploma (59%), compared with 21% of Mexicans born in the U.S.You see, the positive narrative changes not reality.</comment>

White Latinos of Spanish descent of which there are going to be millions both sides of the border are more likely to be Conservative.  They are also going to be familiar and have a great deal of fear about the other 'latinos' ie the full blood and mixed blood mestizo gangbanging welfare dependent La Raza supporters who see the Democrats as their ticket to flood America with their rat breeding brothers sisters and cousins. That's about the gist of the situation.</comment>

Marlene J Looney::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:26 PM::<comment>To all that responded to Cuban gal....Truth be said, we all have valid points in this discussion.  I appreciate the respect that we can demonstrate to each other as we posit our views.To Courageous:  No one said that White Europeans haven't kept their roots.  It is purely observational, but as many of Europeans migrating over to the US made a conscious decision to abandon their native language as soon as they arrived. Granted they all spoke different languages unlike Latin Americans who share a common language.  I spoke to nothing else but this observation.  Of course, as generations are removed from that first immigrant, they further assimilate as well as add to what is the new culture but slowly move away from the language and customs of the original immigrant.  I can't expect my son nor did I ever want to inculcate in him my "Cubaness".  Yet, there are customs that my mother and I brought with us that I continue to uphold but have fused with customs and mores of the culture I've lived and participated in.  And once he visited Cuba and his Cuban family, he found a deep love and attraction for that side of his heritage.   This came from him organically.To Antony Palmer:  correctTo Alec:  Please refer to The Immigration Act of 1965 that changed the pattern of predominantly letting in White of European background (there are 34 ethnic groups comprising the label of "white") to accepting all nationalities (which of course is identification along the lines of nation states) on a roughly equal basis.  You are on the mark on the issue of authoritarian tendencies both Dem and GOP and how Trump is leveraging these tendencies.  Beware, we may end up having reverse immigration going back to ancestral lands.  You are right that intermarriage does not erase or blur the lines.  This is quite evident along racial (Black, White, Mulato, Mestizo) Latin Americans and Europeans who (in the case of Latin America as I can only speak to this) who find us-the children of the Europeans who came to the New World (Criollos), less than.To Stone Soup:  "Hispanics" "Latinos"-terms that for the most part we do not label ourselves with as we are diverse despite sharing a common language, probably won't be co-opted by Blacks.  It is not social order but political power that drives social order.  Look at the Cubans as an example.  We represent 3% of the "Hispanic" population and yet the political power that has kept an immoral blockade (refer to Lester Mallory Assistant Secretary of Western Hemisphere April 6, 1961 referring that the objective of the embargo should be to "cause hunger, starvation, depreciation in real wages for the Cuban people") against a small (yet geopolitically and geographically strategic land mass) island in effect for more than 54 years has come from the very Cubans (Batistianos) that left the island losing all of their power then and hoping to restore it through its machinations and narrative.  The very Cubans who are the nephews of Fidel Castro in the US Congress and more.  It is their power that has driven countless of Presidential hopefuls to Versaille Restaurant in Little Havana to pander to the power brokers who finance them.  So, a blanket statement on Latin Americans in the US (as we are Americans too) is not fully descriptive.Thanks to all for a lively, healthy and respectful discussion.  I hope that as I pass along my perspective, others learn as well as I learn from others perspectives.  .</comment>
