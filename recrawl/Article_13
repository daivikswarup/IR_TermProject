Does Ben Carson Suspect His Campaign Was a Scam?


For months, reporters and political operatives (including me) have been pointing out that Ben Carson’s campaign bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam operation. Now Carson seems to agree. On CNN on Tuesday, Carson discussed his year-end staff shake-up:“We had people who didn't really seem to understand finances," a laughing Carson told CNN's Poppy Harlow on "CNN Newsroom," adding, "or maybe they did—maybe they were doing it on purpose."It’s a remarkable statement—especially because he’s so blithe about it.Carson has taken in incredible amounts of money during the race. His campaign has raised more than any other Republican presidential  rival, though they’ve raised more when super PACs are included. But he’s also spent more than any of them, so that despite his prolific fundraising, he has barely $4 million in cash on hand.Where Is Ben Carson's Money Going? That’s because Team Carson has been plowing a huge portion of the money it raises back into fundraising, using costly direct-mail and telemarketing tactics. Pretty much every campaign uses those tools, but the extent to which Carson was using it raised eyebrows around politics. First, many of the companies being paid millions and millions of dollars are run by top campaign officials or their friends and relations, meaning those people are making a mint. Second, many of the contributions are coming from small-dollar donors. If that money is being given by well-meaning grassroots conservatives for a campaign that’s designed not to win but to produce revenue for venders, isn’t it just a grift?These questions have been circling since last summer. If they're right, the most sympathetic interpretation is that Carson, like his donors, was being taken for a ride by his aides, and wasn’t in on the scam. Carson seemed to suggest as much on Tuesday, implying he was taken advantage of by aides who treated the campaign as an ATM. That doesn’t necessarily reflect well on him, though. If Carson couldn’t see what was going on in his own campaign, is he ready to run the country?The question is also nearly obsolete. Carson’s polling was in a tailspin even before he sacked several top advisers, and it hasn’t gotten any better since. While he insists he’s staying in the race for the long haul, there doesn’t appear to be much reason for him to do so. Besides, he’s likely to run out of cash soon: Carson spent significantly more than he brought in during January. Whatever else you can say about the old team, they kept the money rolling in.


CWB::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 4:41 PM::<comment>Ben's problem is endemic to charitable fund raising generally. Don't respond to direct mail or phone solicitations. Yes, they tug on you heart strings. That's the tool they use to extract your money. The percent that actually goes to the cause is very low to negligible. If there is a cause that you believe in donate directly.</comment>

phil::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 5:34 PM::<comment>All this hit-piece tells us is that Ben Carson is still a viable threat in the mind of the author. Otherwise why even write it? ( I love the faux compassion for the small dollar donor.)  Ben Carson is probably the most upright man you will ever do a story on.</comment>

Guinnessmonkey::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 5:42 PM::<comment>Because whether or not Carson was in on the scam that was his campaign is still up for debate, and evidence to the contrary is news.</comment>

Epithet::Thursday, February 25, 2016 4:52 AM::<comment>A team put together spur of the moment cost more up front than those that have been planning a race all along (which is everybody else). He picked people that have been successful and they took advantage of him. Dr. Carson decided to let them go (and now they work for trump to try and improve their image). Carson has the highest favorability rating than any other candidate and have polled the best against the Democrats.  The media along with his ex campaign staffers (Bennett and watts) have done a number on carson and, yes they are trying to make sure he stays down. Trump is how the Democrats want to face in the general. But for trump he has been underestimated this whole cycle and may not be the push over they thought he would be. </comment>

You know "nice guys"finish last as the saying goes. remember republican 'nice guy' Romney, loser  and his super loss. The "nice" guys can take it home and look in the mirror and feel good, but they can't take it to bank as winners of the debate for top dog.

Maybe the American people will even be able to afford clothes made here, once our jobs are restored and our economy starts humming again.

George Neidorf::Thursday, February 25, 2016 2:36 PM::<comment>to bring jobs home there have to be manufacturers with plants set up and ready to go and that won't happen because they can't predict sales and don't know what the wage scale will be so they don't know how much to charge for their products. "maybe" is not enough to build an economy. America thrived on exports and working americans being able to buy the products they made. those days are gone. the u.s. cannot match chinese and southeast asian wages. there are very few separate economies, nearly the entire world is economically linked. the "good old days" are long gone and there's no going back.

LiLa::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:29 PM::<comment>NUMEROUS Reasons to Vote for Trump in 2016:1.Trump Is Not a Career Politician. Career politicians have failed the people of the United States and it’s time to seek an alternative leader. It will take a long time to fix all the harm that Obama and Bush caused, but Trump is a smart man and he can do it.2.No One Owns Trump. Trump’s presidential campaign is self funded and he has no lobbyists or special interests groups telling him what to do. Trump’s loyalty will only be to America and Americans, not any political party, special interest group or foreign entity.3.Trump Is Not Politically Correct. Trump isn’t afraid to say what he thinks, and he can definitely voice his opinion. Trump does not back down or apologize for speaking his mind, and If he has a problem with you, you will know it.4.Trump Will Stop Illegal Immigration. Illegal immigration is killing the United States and hurting hard working American families. Trump loves America and will definitely stop the flow of illegal immigrants pouring into this great nation. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are pouring into Europe and their people can’t stop it. Trump will not let that happen here at home.5.Trump Has Excellent Negotiation Skills. Trump’s not a politician. He’s an very successful billionaire businessman. He’s a problem solver, and that’s why he’s leading in all the polls. He’s an amazing negotiator, probably the best in history. Trump will deal with trade and deal with issues without being bullied.6.Trump Will Create More U.S. Jobs and Fix the Economy. Trump will be the greatest jobs president ever elected. He will bring back jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, and many other countries. Bringing the jobs back will also bring the money back to the United States.7.No One Will Be Tougher on Terrorism Than Donald Trump. Trump has already been saying things publicly that our military started doing after he said it. Trump is a true leader, and will bring back our best people, or find the best people to get the job done.8.Trump Will Build the Military Back Up so It Is the Strongest in the World. Trump has already called for a military buildup so broad that no foe would ever dare challenge the United States, as well as a new health care deal for veterans stuck on waiting lists in hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs.9.Trump Supports the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is America’s first freedom. That’s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment. Protecting that freedom is imperative.10.Trump Will Make America Great Again. It sure seems that Donald Trump is the one holding all the cards. From stopping illegal immigration and fighting terrorism, to protecting your Second Amendment rights, Donald Trump owns the polls. Americans are sick and tired of bought and paid for politicians and it is showing.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MORE reasons to vote for Donald Trump:1. He is a PROUD Christian husband, father and grandfather.2. Mr. Trump really has a great sense of humor.3. He is NOT DISHONEST in any way.4. He means what he says and says what he means.5. He genuinely loves America and Americans.6. He is not racist or sexist in any way, shape or form.7. His supporters are loyal only to him.8. He unites Democrats, Independents and Republicans very easily.9. He will bomb and defeat ISIS by taking the oil they sell to support themselves.10. He will support the Constitution without question.11. He will support and defend the 2nd Amendment, build up our military, build a border wall and support our Veterans.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~29 MORE REASONS TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP:http://www.empirestatenews.net...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TRUMP 2016!!

What exactly do you think someone like that is going to do for the working stiffs of this country? It's the guys like him that have been shipping all our good jobs overseas and leaving nothing but the minimum wage jobs here. He talks down the Mexicans and practically every other immigrant that's here (totally forgetting the FACT that we are ALL immigrants, well, except for the Native Americans, that is), yet he uses Mexicans for all his landscaping jobs and for construction of any of his buildings. So, doesn't that make him the ultimate hypocrite? I think so, and I also think that you have been sold a bill of goods by a snake-oil salesman.</comment>

NashvilleVaper::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:04 PM::<comment>12. He will magically accomplish things by himself that the Constitution says Congress must initiate or approve, while "supporting the Constitution" at the same time.  Including "taking out the families" of terrorists, which would be a war crime that Congress would most certainly not support.Some other observations:As for #4, "He means what he says and says what he means", that is a silly reason to vote for him.  First of all, deluded people mean what they say, but it is only evidence of their delusion.  Secondly, he is saying what he knows a sizable percentage of the population want to hear, using overly simplistic language.  He is continually vague, giving no specifics about plans, because he knows his target audience aren't interested in details, have short attention spans, and are motivated by emotion over substance.  Thirdly, insulting the disabled, trashing a war veteran as a loser because he was captured by the enemy, and using vulgar language in front of a crowd is not "telling it like it is" or evidence of honesty.  Rather, it is evidence of a defective character.  Anyone who cannot understand the difference should not vote.  One can resist being politically correct without being a demeaning, arrogant jackass.  Of course, raging narcissists only and always see themselves in a positive light and believe that their way is the only way simply because it is their way.  As a prominent psychiatrist once put it, "a narcissist has never seen a mirror they don't love" and consider the sound of their own voice as the epitome of beautiful music.But, all that doesn't matter in terms of the election.  Trump will be the GOP nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the most corrupt politician in a generation (at least) will be the Democrat nominee.  This is not only the year of the angry voter, it is also the year where a sizable percentage of the electorate are willing to support a candidate despite all evidence of their unsuitability for office.</comment>

You have to choose the path you believe in. I remember as a child, feeling freedoms that are no longer felt anymore... I remember the illusion of what America was founded to be, and it isn't/wasn't the suppressing government overreach big government has imposed on the people, with their mandatory Obamacare, lest you get fined.

57girl::Friday, February 26, 2016 10:20 AM::<comment>Study some of the key points in history, and suddenly some of those 'conspiracy theories' begin to make a whole lot of sense.  It becomes apparent as to how the 'establishment' get away with the things that it does.Between the incorporation of America 150 years ago, tweaking a few definitions ... one of the biggies ... turning corporations into people, the manipulation of the Federal Reserve. the founding of the IRS, taking gold and silver off of the table, NAFTA .... blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.,Corporate America is a far cry from our Founding Father's ideals, I am sure. But they must have known, because they tired to warn us, as did various figures throughout history. Eisenhower tried to warn us of the Military Industrial Complex, JFK tried to warn us about 'shadow governments' lingering behind the scenes and he tried to bring competition to the Federal Reserve by issuing the Silver Certificate. That didn't last long. And look at where it got him, may JFK RIP. Then, though not a President, Ron Paul has been pushing for a Fed Audit since the 1970s ... the Federal Reserve enables the wars to go on at the banker's delight. There is a reason for Conspiracy Theorists to distrust the Government and there is even better reason that these theories exist ...  connect the dots.When the IMF absorbs the Federal reserve's debt, America will be under the thumb of one-world bankers.  Coming soon. If we were smart, America would declare bankruptcy, reclaim the power of the national purse and kick the Federal Reserve (and the IRS) to the curb. Iceland jailed their bankers in 2010 (or there abouts) and reclaimed their economy. After two or three years their economy was thriving, less the middleman who sits back and collects interest on the national debt.The founding of the DOJ (legislative) which is overseen by the President (executive) is the reason Congress has been hobbled.We need to blow the dust off of our Declaration of Independence and exercise our Duties within.  I doubt this generation has even read it though. Sad.</comment>

kf::Friday, February 26, 2016 12:21 AM::<comment>Why won't Trump the 'great American' release his tax returns? He said he would but has not. Even the great patriot Romney is calling him out on this. Also, Trump a great businessman? Please. Economists have shown that he could have invested the 40 million (or more) he inherited in a conservative indexed fund and sat back and made billions by now. Maybe even more than he has. The only thing Trump is good at is having the biggest ego in the world.Your made in America argument is anti-free market, anti-free trade, and anti-capitalism. We can't compete with the Bangladesh's of the world when it comes to clothing industry wages. That is unless you want government interference in the free market. Do you want the government to raise the minimum wage so people could raise a family on this salary? I bet not and there is no way Trump would. Do you want the government to step in and slap tariffs on incoming clothing in yet another role for big government? If you want big government in each of these situations you probably want to consider Bernie Sanders and not some philandering tycoon on his third wife.Whose 'merit' (as you say) is the U.S. thriving on? Russia's? China's? What is merit other than an extremely vague term? We have the biggest economy in the world (and will still be the biggest by at least 2030 according to Bloomberg), the most advanced military (by far), and one of the highest Human Development Index scores in the world. I know its a common conservative (especially Trump with his 'Make America Great Again' slogan) narrative to say the country is falling apart but its not. You make outlandish statements but cannot back it up with any real evidence. President Obama guided the country through a recovery fro the Bush fiasco. The big auto manufacturers are having record years having almost gone belly-up in the previous administration, home sales prices, GDP, consumer spending, are all up. We still have a long way to go and there are many that have given up looking for a job. The budget deficit he inherited from Bush was about 1.4 trillion and it went down steadily from 2009-2014 (I don't have post '14 data).You comment above that the President wants to erase our borders. What evidence do you have of this outrageous statement other than some knee-jerk opinion from any number of right-wing radio lunatics? Is your evidence that he doesn't invade the wrong country like Bush? Because he doesn't drop bombs on every country that looks at us funny?</comment>

57girl::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:28 AM::<comment>"That is unless you want government interference in the free market." ....I was laughing so hard when I got to this point, I didn't bother with the rest of you ludicrous comment.You should google NAFTA, CAFTA, the SPP, the TPP, and on and on ... you NWO guppies crack me up. If Free Trade were left in the hands of private businesses, and overseen on a local basis through the Cities, States and other local government offices, less the 'FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS' that have outsourced our  jobs to the favor of everyone, except ourselves, America would still be thriving ... Hence, Make America great again ...  We need to bring our jobs back to America and kick start our own economy. Today's government has betrayed the people through their 'interference' and they've been doing it for 150 years. I'm surprised you haven't noticed by now.Free Trade has been blowing out the window, since America Incorporated. Then, in the early 1990's, Billy Boy came along and turned the fan on with NAFTA.  It is about time somebody shut the damned window.Touching on your final question ... google the North American Union (NAU) ... or the CFR (look at their mission statement). The evidence is everywhere ... GWB went to Mexico in 2005 and signed a Treaty with Mexico and Canada to merge borders with the Untied States (the NAU). Look at our illegal immigration problem and our failing economy ... wait until the IMF swallows the Federal Reserve with their one-world currency. Our borders  and our National Sovereignty are fading fast. Do some research, Google it!</comment>

Obviously, you've never heard of it.Start paying the guy behind the counter at McDonald's $15.00 an hour and watch the price of a hamburger jump in turn.  And I suspect, if a company is forced to pay $15.00/Hr for an employee, they will be hiring the cream of the crop to get the most for their money. That is going to leave a whole bunch of people who don't have enough self-respect or ambition  to seek the skills to become employable left in the cold, or with hours cut to part time to avoid having to pay insurance, don't you think? Actually, I suspect most fast food chains and such are already doing the part-time thing to stay competitive and keep their prices affordable as it is.</comment>

57girl::Friday, February 26, 2016 9:38 AM::<comment>Actually, I am. I was a little girl, during the Civil Rights movement.  I remember the peace felt among the races. People got along and they respected each other, prior to the civil rights movement. Families were happy, and both Mom and Dad ran the household (under the same roof, no less). I grew up in a small country community where everybody knew their neighbors, in spite of the miles between us, black or white.  As time went by, I also remember some angry black youth walking up to me in Jr. High School chanting that my parents kept their parents as slaves, which was absolutely ludicrous. The Civil Rights Movement had begun. I don't know why the people waited for so long. The Civil War had been over for a hundred years by then. My parent's weren't even born in the same century, and I dare say that today's generation can not, nor should it have to, be held responsible for a war that was fought 150 years ago over. It is over.I remember when families were close, and loving, and clean, and most households had both Mom and Dad at home. Dad worked, and mom took care of the household and as a family, they managed to live quite comfortably on one income. Very few families had a two family income, nor did they need one. Now everybody is so busy chasing a frigging dollar to pay for taxes, and Obamacare, and this fee, and that fine, and ya de da de da ... it is no wonder there are so many one parent households, many of which are living on welfare, and in some cases, for generations.America's hope and its pride have been stolen. If you are young, then I don't expect you to realize the feeling of at least 'feeling' free of government overreach. It was a time when people had self respect and self assurance. They were too busy working for their keep to get into trouble. Before there was any such thing as welfare and or social security (both had already been implemented by the time I was born), I hear tell families took care of each other from one generation to the next. Families were close and they stood by each other. Today, it seems they kill each other.Anyone born in this Century, or perhaps the late 90's will have nothing to compare then and now with. But, I have, and I am telling you ... America is getting ready to jump track. Our economy is getting ready to crash, and from what I have read, the IMF is prepared to take over and save the day. The IMF handles SDRs (a one world currency). If they hijack our economy, you can compare today's America with the NAU in the coming years. Another option, go ahead and go bankrupt and restructure our economy like Iceland did in 2012. They broke free of the IMF and reclaimed the power of their purse, and have been thriving ever since.You can go to Wikipedia and look up SDRs and read all about them. I don't people have connected the dots. We are on the verge of losing our National Sovereignty. Trump can't stop the crash, but I think he'd be the best suited to pick up the pieces and put America back on track in the aftermath of the chaos ... which is why the establishment is in a panic.Like Trump, or not ... he is the only one who has focused on resurrecting our borders. And I think he has every intention of doing it, if it is not too late already.</comment>

57girl::Friday, February 26, 2016 4:09 AM::<comment>So who are you rooting for, Hillary the criminal, or Bernie the Socialist?On the Republican side, all you have to choose from is a Canadian born Dual Citizen, accompanied by his CFR wife, or Rubio ... who's eligibility is questionable, since his parents were not American citizens at the time of his birth,even though Marko himself was born on US soil. That would make him an Anchor baby, not a natural born citizen ... which used to be a prerequisite to the Presidency per our US Constituion ... the original version.As much of a gentleman as Dr. Carson is, I don't see him standing a snowball's chance at making it for more than a month, given the poll numbers ... he may as well save his money, unless he's making money under the table with his campaign, which I doubt he is. Dr. Carson does not 'appear' to be the same old sleaze most of them are, but he is too soft spoken to be a strong leader.Then there is Donald Trump, who puts the cards face up on the table and doesn't care whose toes he steps on in the process ... as long as he wins. That is exactly the personality we need to negotiate on behalf of America's better interest.Trump has admitted he's played both sides of the fence. Where's the lie? He's been there, done that, and knows how the game is played. I am sure, with his negotiation skills, President Trump will put America back in the black, unless of course the economy crashes all together and the IMF comes riding in on their white horse to save the day with their SDRs.You can call me all of the names your little heart desires if it makes you day, but I am willing to take a chance on Trump above the rest, simply because he has not sold his sold to the lobbyists, if anything he has bought THEM. No matter, America is a corporation, and that is not apt to change anytime soon, so we may as well elect a smart, cunning CEO who is the only one standing on stage with the ability and the balls to resurrect America's sovereignty and secure our borders while we still have borders to secure.</comment>

William Viteri::Sunday, February 28, 2016 11:18 AM::<comment>57Girl, I am going for Rubio.   He has 16 years of government experience - 2 as West Palm Beach City Commissioner, 8 years as a Florida legislator and now 6 years as senator.  Rubio is on 10 committees in the senate.  Obama only had 10 years experience before he launched his candidacy for president.  As comparison,  John F. Kennedy had 8 years experience as a congressman and 6 years as senator. He ran for president in the fourth year as senator.  Obama ran for president only after 1.5 years as senator.  As far as absence,  Rubio does better than Kennedy while campaigning for President.  Rubio has missed 40% to Kennedy's 49%.   Obama's absentee record was 58%.  Hilary was 65% and Kerr's was 88%.  Rubio's overall presence was 88%.   As far as Trump's record, he has no government experience to deal with politicians which is a negative.  His business record is atrocious with 4 bankruptcies plus two of his enterprises closed like Trump University and Trump Airlines.  As per Bloomberg news, he has numerous  lawsuits against him, some in the US and some overseas. New York Times research indicated and Rubio cited that  Trump has hired illegals from Poland and for that he was fined by the government $1 million.  He currently employs over 100 from Romania at his club in Florida.  If he is for the American workers and against illegals, why does he continue to go overseas to get employees?   He has 4 class action lawsuits (2 in California, 1 in New York  and 1 in Florida) against him for fraud with respect to Trump University  by former students who paid as much as $35 thousand for a University study in Real Estate that was not even accredited.  Trump's record of cheating, deceiving and lying can only be described as a con artist.  Can we afford having this type of character- Trumpie, as our president.  Absolutely not.</comment>

William Viteri::Sunday, February 28, 2016 11:31 AM::<comment>57Girl:  The US Supreme Court in the case of US VS Wong Kim Ark (169 US 649), on March 28th, 1898 decided that "Children born in the United States of foreigners permanently domiciled and resident in the U.S. at the time of birth automatically acquire U.S. citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."    Rubio's parents were legal permanent residents of the US, and as per  US Supreme Court Decision of 1898, Rubio is a  US natural born citizen as per the 14th Amendment clause.  So that argument about Rubio not qualifying is invalid as the US Supreme Court Decision.</comment>

TravisJSays::Thursday, February 25, 2016 9:53 AM::<comment>The comparison is simple. While Obama is a progressive, and Trump has no discernable ideology except caring about his money, both have run similar campaigns based on empty promises and cult of personality, convincing gullible voters that redemption comes from making the candidate their leader. Neither man had any proven record to prove they could deliver.Also, btw, babbling about CFR shows your ignorance. Obama's leftwing views are what is dangerous, not CFR and Obama's not a 'puppet' but a willing leftist. Trump is as establishment insider as anyone.</comment>

According to the website YouGuv and the organization Public Policy Polling, a recent survey of Trump supporters in South Carolina showed that 70% wanted the return of the Confederate flag to the state capitol, 38% wish that the South had won the Civil War, and nearly 20% disagreed with the thrust of the Emancipation Proclamation.  While about 78% of all Republican voters disagreed with the statement that whites are racially superior to blacks, only 69% of Trump supporters held that belief.  So the man, whatever his populist leanings, tends to attract racists and xenophobes.  Not a particularly "American" way to run a respectable campaign.</comment>

So it appears that he gave his staff too much leadway before letting them go for not being financially responsible, like he is. He probably waited too long, but regardless, he's focused on his campaign policies and has done a good job of that, as evidenced on his website ( bencarson.com ). Whether he wins or loses in this Presidential campaign, he's performed as an honest, straight forward American. That's what has drawn so many people to him. The MSMedia, and particularly this website and many of its followers, can only speculate and lie in their attempts to put Dr Carson in a bad light. Your attacks are transparent and foolish. None of the mud you throw will stick to him.    When all is said and done, whether he succeeds or not in his attempt to be President, he'll be met by his family and friends, those who know him best with the loving acceptance of "well done, good and faithful" follower of Jesus. And when he crosses over into Heaven, Jesus himself will say the same thing, because it's true.</comment>

NumbersUSA could stop amnesty as a concept if they did things the smart way, but that would also mean Roy Beck and his son would be out of a job.</comment>

beavertank::Thursday, February 25, 2016 3:04 AM::<comment>It's funny that you scoff at the evidence presented, then quote a portion of the piece that doesn't actually touch on the evidence... but giving you the benefit of the doubt:The evidence that his campaign is a scam is the sheer volume of money that has been paid to campaign insiders. And not just supporters (which is a pretty normal, if unfortunate, part of politics) but people in key decision making positions within the campaign who are either paid exorbitant amounts for their services (like Dean Parker, the "finance chair" whose position was mainly honorary, who was drawing $20k/month as a salary before quitting after that fact was brought to light) or who send significant amounts of paid-campaign business to their own enterprises (like the $4.7 million of business, in the last quarter alone, that went to Eleventy Marketing Group, which just so happens to be owned by the campaign's chief marketing advisor).And those are just two quick examples. Digging into the campaign's FEC filing turns up plenty more of the same kind of thing.So THAT is why his campaign "bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam".As for his "still being in the race"? It's true that he hasn't suspended his campaign. But consistently coming in at the bottom of the polls without any meaningful improvement almost certainly means he has no chance at getting the nomination, so he's not really "in the race" in that he has no hope of winning and there's no consolation prize for sticking it through to the bitter end.</comment>

beavertank::Friday, February 26, 2016 1:26 AM::<comment>The more I see of Ben Carson The Candidate today, compared to the Ben Carson Whiz Surgeon of yesteryear, the more I'm convinced there's something legitimately medically wrong with him. His oddly sleepy demeanor, his strange lines of reasoning, and the fact that two teeth just fell out of his head in a campaign stop in May... None of that points to "brilliant surgeon". And yet, he once was a brilliant surgeon, and there's no debating that. Something has changed.I also have a feeling the man himself knows there's something wrong, which is why he quit performing surgeries entirely, but hasn't seen a doctor to get an actual diagnosis. Which is a pretty common thing among doctors. They make the worst patients, and are usually happy to diagnose themselves and not seek out additional opinions....so no, I don't think he would make a very good surgeon general, and not just because I disagree with all of the policy positions I've seen coming from him. I don't think it's appropriate to appoint someone apparently suffering from a disease causing mental decline to a position like that.</comment>

Alex::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:06 AM::<comment>You're in denial buddy. Carson hasn't been a viable candidate since Iowa. He has a dedicated 5%, and has negative momentum, is running out of $ and the only press he has been getting for the past 3 weeks has been negative. My guess is the 5% he is retaining are the dopes who got grifted by his aide-de-pimps and there MLM fundraising scheme.The only thing Carson staying in the campaign is doing is possibly keeping Trump from gaining another 2.5% of the votes, while Cruz, Rubio & Kasich would fight over the remaining 2.5% up for grabs. Basically, Carson's supporters are folks who are fed up with DC insiders but who don't want to vote for Trump because they're either minorities, or they just dislike Trump, which is more than understandable.To back my assertion, 4-5 days ago, Carson himself said (paraphrasing) "I'm getting a lot of pressure to stay in this race".</comment>

ano333::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:07 PM::<comment>Consider withholding your vote from the nominee (Trump) and instead casting it for Carson even though he will be dropping out soon...</comment>

JaneJones::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:25 PM::<comment>Carson never fought on a level playing field either--he is an affirmative action doctor.</comment>

Crz::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:34 PM::<comment>What is an affirmative action doctor? is that like someone who has a quota of how many people of each race he'll treat? You make no sense.</comment>

Crz::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:33 PM::<comment>Liam might be choking on the words, but you can't even get the words out! Here in grownup-land we don't spell words as if we're texting our besties.</comment>

What Are You Looking At?::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 6:57 PM::<comment>Look, I would have voted for Carson if he made it to the finals, but it's looking like he won't, so I'm not speaking from a hostile viewpoint. But how can he run the country if he can't run a campaign?</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:07 PM::<comment>ppl are crooked, can't change that.  Carson has guts enough to deal with it w/out degrading anyone. Real leadership. If elected, Carson expose the trickery/deception in Washington. That's why ppl are coming against him so bad. No fluff and pretense with him. He WILL deal with Washington. </comment>

ano333::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:08 PM::<comment>"If elected, Carson expose the trickery/deception in Washington."But he didn't see the trickery in his own campaign?</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:23 PM::<comment>When he did, he dealt with it. Some things are a bit more obvious (Washington) bc we've been seeing it for years. Nonetheless, Carson is fighting for your rights and mine, even if ppl don't like him. </comment>

JaneJones::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:26 PM::<comment>Are you kidding me? The worst grifters and incompetents are still inside his campaign. It was the most competent ones who bailed his sinking ship.</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:38 PM::<comment>Who are they then and what did they do?</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:43 PM::<comment>Carson's biggest character flaw is that he fails to recognize his own egregious shortcomings.  This man is not fit to run for Dog-Catcher, much less POTUS.</comment>

Josh Jasper::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:07 PM::<comment>If Carson ever did become prez, the whole gov would be exposed of the deception and changed. Alex Jones much?</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:18 PM::<comment>So, I take it your okay with how Washington is being run? And if you are, that's ok. That's ur right. </comment>

Josh Jasper::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:22 PM::<comment>I take it you worry about chemtrails. That's also your right.Uh... i maen also ur right.</comment>

ThunderLizard::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:43 PM::<comment>Maybe if Carson wasn't self-medicating he would have been more savvy to these saboteurs.</comment>

MindGame::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:13 PM::<comment>It was all the glyconutrients' fault!!!</comment>

HIIIPower::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:49 PM::<comment>who is going to prosecute them and on what charges?</comment>

Bonegirl06::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 11:01 PM::<comment>Seems very odd that a person would let people run his campaign who were obviously trying to sabotage it.  The more likely explanation is that he's trying to cover up his own incompetence.</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 11:15 PM::<comment>Sometimes we can trust people, only to find we've been stabbed in the back. Can happen to anyone, but, when it came to light, he dealt with it. </comment>

Bonegirl06::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 11:23 PM::<comment>Except you said you've been hearing about it for months.  And you'd think he would have more grasp on where the money for his own campaign was going.  That he didn't is problematic, to say the least.</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 11:39 PM::<comment>It was from people who I speak with personally. People whose politcal views can absolutely be trusted. Never publicized in main stream media that I seen, anyways. Carson has done well in dealing with his campaign. At least he has not turned a blind eye to it and let it continue. Besides, IF Carson was in the wrong, name one candidate who hasn't made any errors, whether by accident or purposefully. </comment>

Bonegirl06::Thursday, February 25, 2016 1:52 AM::<comment>If people not even connected with his campaign can see that it's corrupt, then people actually in the campaign should be able to see it too.  He turned a blind eye to it for many months.  Surely he wasn't ignorant of the media's questioning and the investigation into his campaign finances.  No one is saying Carson can't make mistakes, but to be this blindsided by something going on right under one's nose doesn't exactly speak of someone ready to take on the highest office in the nation.</comment>

bindino_7::Thursday, February 25, 2016 2:34 AM::<comment>Oftentimes, those on the outside can see more clearly than those in the midst of the fire. A leader MUST be able able to rely on trusted advisors. One man alone is not a know all, be all. I think he handled his campaign very admirably.  :)</comment>

Bonegirl06::Thursday, February 25, 2016 6:32 AM::<comment>Somehow I get the feeling you would think that regardless.</comment>

MZale::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 6:29 PM::<comment>At least there's finally some explanation as to why he's still in the race.</comment>

Alesis::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:36 PM::<comment>Half of the GOP primaries candidacies were or are scams. This is literally a party of pyramid schemers.</comment>

spud8meister::Thursday, February 25, 2016 12:16 AM::<comment>That's why they "suspend " rather then "end" campaigns . People still get paid, and the candidate retains some discretion on use of funds</comment>

dott::Thursday, February 25, 2016 8:35 AM::<comment>Who paid off Hillary's last massive campaign debts?  Hmm.</comment>

spudwhisperer::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 6:48 PM::<comment>I kind of feel bad about Ben Carson.  He's clearly a brilliant man within his field - but I suspect that his scientific brilliance does not translate well to anything outside science.You really have to be a good generalist to be a good POTUS.</comment>

bindino_7::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 6:58 PM::<comment>This race has nothing to do with his brilliance, but with our culture and how ppl are looking more for entertainment vs substance. </comment>

MindGame::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:14 PM::<comment>You're right, Carson was pretty damn entertaining.</comment>

JaneJones::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:27 PM::<comment>"Brilliant" people do not need affirmative action.</comment>

spudwhisperer::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 7:36 PM::<comment>Obama needed affirmative action - but I am not aware that Carson got any.In any event - look at his accomplishments compared to Obama. Carson was the first surgeon to successfully separate Siamese twins joined at the head.No white surgeon ever did that before.  Carson proved his brilliance and innovation in the field.Obama has never had an original idea in his entire life - he is merely a professional verbiage guy.</comment>

jt::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:16 PM::<comment>How does brain surgery translate to politics? Obama ran several successful campaigns and is currently living in the white house.  Carson is running a campaign that does nothing more than steal money from people who think he is actually running for office. Why not try an objective apples to apples comparison of Obama to Carson's relevant accomplishments and get back to us with the results.</comment>

spudwhisperer::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:19 PM::<comment>Obama did not accomplish anything except having a pleasant appearance and speaking voice - and being mixed-race, to give average Ellen and Oprah-watching middle Americans some comfort zone feelings.</comment>

mediakitty::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:31 PM::<comment>> Obama did not accomplish anything except having a pleasant appearance and speaking voiceHow does an adult only accomplish that? Stop being a liar.</comment>

jt::Wednesday, February 24, 2016 8:35 PM::<comment>So one for Obama and none for Carson?</comment>
