How Math Beat Rubio


As polls closed on Super Tuesday, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz were the only candidates worth discussing. Trump's seven-state win—and his raucous speech-meets-press conference, haunted by the specter of Chris Christie—carried the news, while Cruz’s more modest showing earned him network coverage of his victory speech and an interview with Wolf Blitzer.Marco Rubio, on the other hand, was off TV for most of the night. If not for a last-minute win in Minnesota, he'd be firmly in the also-ran column with John Kasich and Ben Carson. He now trails Trump and Cruz in delegates by a wide margin.Not so good for the guy who many pundits reckoned to have the best chance to beat Trump. How-the-mighty-have-fallen is one of the most reliable tropes in American politics, and so it's easy to write off Rubio's thrashing as regrettable, but probably well-earned. You had your shot, Marco; quit complaining.But the truth is that Rubio didn't deserve this.By all accounts, it appears he finished a respectable third nationwide. Real Clear Politics calculates he won 22 percent of the Super Tuesday vote, compared to 30 percent for Cruz and 35 percent for Trump. But somehow Rubio ended up with just 17 percent of the delegates.The trouble, as I've written before, lies in the delegate math. Take Texas, where he finished in third place with 18 percent of the vote. In a truly proportional system, that would entitle him to around 26 delegates—more than he picked up over the four previous primaries combined.Instead, he got three.Some of the blame for that goes to Texas's statewide cutoff, which requires a candidate to receive 20 percent or more of the vote before they can grab any of the state's 47 at-large delegates. That's damaging enough, and relatively widespread among Super Tuesday states, but you can see the logic. It forces candidates to demonstrate that they can appeal to a substantial chunk of the state’s overall electorate.The same rules apply to the other two-thirds of the delegates, who are awarded based on the tallies in each congressional district. In Texas, candidates can claim a maximum of three delegates per district, for a total of 108.But here's the wrinkle: Even if candidates get more than 20 percent in a particular district, Texas only awards delegates to the top two candidates. If they’re in third place, they get nothing.That's exactly what happened to Rubio. In six districts, he passed the 20 percent threshold but still trailed second-place Trump, often by less than 2 percent. Accordingly, he got nothing. In the end, he won his three delegates from three different districts, each time narrowly beating Trump for that coveted second slot.All this can seem like small potatoes. But 502,000 people voted for Marco Rubio in Texas. Only 54,000 of them lived in districts where he won a delegate. The other 89 percent of his supporters? Their votes were useless.And if that doesn't scare you, consider that Alabama and Georgia had nearly identical rules. Oklahoma and Tennessee had different cutoffs, but essentially the same system.Only Virginia employed a truly proportional system of allocation. And it’s not coincidence that it’s where Rubio claimed his largest share of delegates on Tuesday night.

John Straka::Thursday, March 3, 2016 5:33 PM::<comment>I would argue that 100% of the votes cast for the Florida senator are useless.</comment>

The Professor::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:28 PM::<comment>Rubio is gaining very useful knowledge and experience which will help him next time.</comment>

David::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:41 PM::<comment>Yes, I am sure that four years hence, the vastly improved Rubiotronic ios will be much better.</comment>

jagiela::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:45 PM::<comment>Rubio backers are as disgusting as the little boy.  Rubio told everyone he would win because Florida was winner take all and he'd get all 99 delegates.  Rubio is just a loser, a nasty nasty man</comment>

CAinDC::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:01 PM::<comment>Part of the problem with primaries is there is an inherent tension between having a quick and orderly primary where the one who can get large cross faction appeal, and a system where delegates are awards proportionally.Without some people decisively winning delegates because of well, winning, you will end up with either a very long two person race, or a three person (or similar) race where no one gets close to 50%</comment>

David::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:43 PM::<comment>That works well in a parliamentary system, but not so much in a presidential one. But what's scary in parliamentary systems is that a 35% share of the vote can run the entire government.</comment>

Martin Shkreli Trump::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:24 PM::<comment>Rubio is one of the last gasps of the Old Order. His struggles are both amusing and sad.</comment>

Lev Bronshtein::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:41 PM::<comment>But his foam parties are on the cutting edge, I hear.</comment>

David::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:44 PM::<comment>Rubio is the bastard love child of HW Bush... I mean what else can explain his love of voodoo economics and long discredited supply-side, neo-con teaparty bullshit.</comment>

Pierce Moffett::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:33 PM::<comment>I can't wait to see him get shellacked by Trump in his home state of Florida.But say what you will about the republican primary rules, at least they don't have as many superdelegates as the dems do.</comment>

David::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:45 PM::<comment>True. And the reason(s) for that are: Jimmy Carter, George McGovern.</comment>

Pierce Moffett::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:47 PM::<comment>The Rs may consider adopting the same system after this election.</comment>

David::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:40 PM::<comment>Fox News can do the math; Rubio is toast. If he is quick, he can get a role as a Tribune of Trump. Embrace the crazy!</comment>

CSmith::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:08 AM::<comment>Is that a Silver Surfer reference?</comment>

f3nan::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:53 PM::<comment>Oh..yeah..Rules are the problem, not the candidate.!Everyone absolutely agrees with that.</comment>

SmartAlec::Thursday, March 3, 2016 11:50 PM::<comment>Now the ground is not fair. Losers crib about rules which are known in advance</comment>

Robert Henry Eller::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:38 AM::<comment>The Republican establishment at both Federal and State levels designed their primary rules on the assumption that not only would the leading vote-getters be the candidates the establishment favored, but that the establishment could control primary outcomes. Both assumptions have proved false in these primaries. The Republican establishment has only itself to blame.</comment>

clubchampion::Friday, March 4, 2016 2:33 AM::<comment>The party gets to make whatever rules they want in these primaries/caucuses.  There's nothing scary about it.  Heck, Florida is an all or nothing state.</comment>

dookieboot2::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:40 AM::<comment>Maaath? We don't need no stinking maaath!</comment>

TimothyLane::Friday, March 4, 2016 4:24 AM::<comment>Rubio knew the rules in all those states -- unless he had an incompetent team.  His own state is winner-take-all, so if he ends up with 1000 fewer votes than Trump, he will get nothing (and he trails far worse than that in the polls).</comment>

bdphd::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:28 AM::<comment>I don't see why we should be "scared" of a proportional system that cuts out also-ran candidates from delegate accumulation. We don't have a proportional system nationally or in any state, and for good reason, because it leads to splintered, ineffective parties continually chasing new coalitions. It works under a certain set of rules, but for the most part, I'm happy with a two-party system. Even if we just considered the primary selection process, I'm not sure why we should favor a system that keeps the electorate split like this by encouraging non-viable candidates to stay in. It's exactly what's happening in the GOP race, where it should have reduced to Cruz and Trump by now.</comment>
