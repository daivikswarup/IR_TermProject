The Right to Abortion—and Religious Freedom


When the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, it reasoned that women have a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. What it left open, though, is “issue of the unborn’s humanity,” according to the University of Illinois philosophy professor Peter Wenz. In part because of this ambiguity, case upon case has been litigated to test the limits of the Court’s decision. But what if the justices had decided the case in terms of the First Amendment instead, arguing that abortion rights are a matter of religious freedom?How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceHere’s why this question is relevant: Even though the Burger Court avoided ruling on the question of fetal personhood in Roe, that issue has featured prominently in subsequent political activism and court decisions related to abortion restrictions. In many of these cases, courts have tried to draw a line after which a woman’s right to an abortion might be outweighed by the state’s interest in protecting the life, or potential life, of a fetus. But, as Wenz argued in a 1992 book declaring abortion rights to be a matter of religious freedom, the definition of fetal personhood is wholly dependent on religious beliefs. So if the government endorses one particular conception of when life begins, it is arguably violating the Establishment Clause by favoring certain religious viewpoints over others—or religion over non-religion, for that matter.When Roe was argued before the Supreme Court, Catholics comprised almost all of the active opposition to abortion. Many evangelical Christian groups still believed abortion to be a deeply personal matter. It wasn’t until the late 1970s that many of them began to oppose abortion in all cases, except in the most extreme circumstances. After the Roe decision, Catholic groups not only sought allies in other religious communities to bolster their claims against abortion but began to frame those arguments in secular rather than religious terms. Over the course of 30 years, those alliances formed into a veritable political and cultural movement.Yet, not all religious groups agree with these interpretations of the morality of abortion. Some Jewish traditions teach that abortion is permissible in cases where the health of the mother is at risk, while others allow for abortion in a number of different circumstances. In other denominations like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, even providing abortion services can lead to excommunication.In a 2014 Pew Research Center study, the percentage of adults polled who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases varied tremendously by religious affiliation. Eighty-two percent of those who identified as Buddhist and 73 percent of those who identified as Jewish favored legality, compared to only 18 percent of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 27 percent of Mormons, and 33 percent of evangelical protestants.The discrepancy in views among religious groups was highlighted in a recent amicus brief filed by a group of theologians and ethicists on behalf of an abortion clinic, Whole Women’s Health, in its Supreme Court challenge of a Texas law that imposes severe restrictions on facilities and doctors. The law would require doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles from where they perform abortions and clinic to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers. “Because there exists no unified religious or moral position on abortion even within major religions, a state’s attempt to restrict the accessibility of abortion necessarily impinges on the religious and moral decisions of some individuals,” the brief says.But the religious-freedom argument isn’t often used by those who support abortion rights—the term is most often used by groups who are staunchly pro-life. In 2009, for example, a group of Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and evangelical Christians institutions drafted the Manhattan Declaration, a “call of Christian conscience” declaring their “obligation” to support "the sanctity of life, traditional marriage, and religious liberty." Since then, signatories have spoken about these causes as if they are inherently linked to one another. And in a number of recent high-profile cases related to abortion and contraception—including 2014’s Hobby Lobby case and the upcoming challenge in Zubik v. Burwell—conservative groups have lobbied for businesses and non-profits to get certain exemptions from federal health-care requirements on religious-freedom grounds.Some progressive and moderate religious groups feel they have been made invisible by religious conservatives’ claim on the idea of religious freedom. The United Church of Christ, which traces its roots back to the Congregational churches of New England, frequently finds itself explaining to surprised outsiders and newcomers that it supports women’s right to abortion, according to Sandy Sorenson, the director of the UCC’s Justice and Witness Ministries office in Washington D.C. “When you say ‘religious liberty’ nowadays, people think that it means it includes the right to discriminate against people who engage in activities I oppose on a moral basis, or even people’s ways of being that I object to,” Sorenson said. “That’s a huge problem.” The UCC is one of over 25 member organizations in the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, a group that includes Jewish, Catholic, Methodist, Episcopal, and other religious groups advocating for access to abortion.But the notion of religious freedom may have become so politically charged that progressive groups are reluctant to invoke it. According to Borgmann, a “very big shift” would be needed for the mainstream reproductive-rights movement to begin using arguments linked to freedom of religion. “I think it’s probably a combination of it being such a big paradigm shift and a fear of alienating people who aren’t motivated by religion,” she said. “The problem when you’re trying to be really inclusive is that religion can seem very exclusionary or off-putting.” Heather Kimmel, an attorney for the United Church of Christ, agreed. “At this point it’s primarily an intellectual exercise to see what would happen,” she said.Legally, though, abortion rights based on the First Amendment, rather than the Fourteenth, might be on more solid footing, argue scholars like Wenz. For example: In a concurring and dissenting opinion in the case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that a Missouri law restricting the use of state funds for abortions violated the Establishment Clause. The law did not violate the clause because it coincided with certain religious viewpoints, he argued, but because there was no “secular purpose” for the law’s assertions.  On the other hand, nine years earlier in Harris v. McRae, a divided Supreme Court ruled in part that the Hyde Amendment, which restricts government funding of abortion services, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment just because the law “may coincide with the religious tenets of the Roman Catholic Church.”It’s likely, though, that there won’t be many chances to test this theory, particularly in upcoming cases. Pro-choice groups seem loath to use religious-freedom arguments for abortion rights—and today’s left-leaning judges may be equally unenthusiastic. The First Amendment case for abortion rights is a “non-starter,” said Linda Greenhouse, who covered the Supreme Court as a journalist for 30 years and is now a senior research scholar at Yale Law School. “It's an argument that judges just don't want to hear.”

Pezdrake::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:20 AM::<comment>No, I just know that each person spending on their own individual medical care doesn't work.  That's why insurance was created to begin with (and private insurance is NOT everyone paying for their own medical care, it's collectivist theory made profitable by the marketplace).  No one would pay for insurance if they didn't need it.  Everyone HATES insurance.  It's also why Medicare was created.  Because the private marketplace failed when it came to senior health care and only government could make it work well.</comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:43 AM::<comment>I used to have good insurance when companies had to compete for business. With government mandates, costs continue to increase. High premiums and deductibles don't provide health care.</comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 2:41 AM::<comment>I don't have Medicare. I have no insurance at all. I already said I pay out of pocket to see a doctor. I was only explaining how it works. I've helped others choose their Medicare Advantage plan which covers the gaps. Medicare recipients don't have employee-provided insurance if they're retired.</comment>

Pezdrake::Saturday, March 5, 2016 2:49 AM::<comment>I'm sorry to hear about your lack of health insurance.  Medicare Advantage doesn't cover "gaps" it's just an extra optional level of coverage that covers additional services. Medicare Advantage is actually the most wasteful, least cost efficient part of Medicare but Congress keeps pushing it like it's going to suddenly become more efficient.  Medigap is what covers Medicare gaps, and it doesn't apply to all beneficiaries. Yes, obviously recipients who are not employed don't have employer provided insurance, although some of that may be employer-sponsored retirement plans that still pay out post-retirement.</comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 3:11 AM::<comment>Those who have it pay no more for it than for Medicare alone. It covers everything Medicare covers and the gaps. I only know this as I help them choose a plan. Medigap only covers the gaps and must be paid for in addition to the Medicare premium.</comment>

Pezdrake::Saturday, March 5, 2016 3:38 AM::<comment>The taxpayers pay for most of the additional Advantage plan costs but there are higher copays for Advantage plan members for the additional services. </comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 5:13 AM::<comment>Those I know who use it pay an average of $20 per doctor visit. Medicare Part A is at no cost as it's said to have been covered by payroll deductions. Parts B and D require extra premiums as well as Medigap. With a Medicare Advantage plan, all portions of Medicare are covered for the same cost as Part B.</comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:50 AM::<comment>I don't know anything about the type of insurance policy you chose for your children. I can only say what I paid for mine. At $80 a month, $2,500 deducible and 80/20 coverage I had a very good policy. It also included dental at 50% coverage and no cost outpatient surgery. It's a good thing I had such a policy when I had a tubal ligation at no cost to me. Try to get something like that now. It would be impossible. The ACA has turned the entire medical establishment upside down. Many insurance companies are opting out and many doctors are leaving their practice.</comment>

Or those wonderful parents you've mentioned before destroy their life savings paying for your treatment.</comment>

SoSuMi::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:56 AM::<comment>A few years ago, I had thousands of dollars worth of tests done at the hospital as an outpatient and made payments until it was paid off.

The people trying to punish women for having sex want people to think this is frequent and done willy-nilly when in fact it's an agonizing, rare decision.</comment>

Dr. Preobrazhensky::Friday, March 4, 2016 6:26 AM::<comment>That's still over a thousand every year.Tiller's words:"We have some experience with late terminations; about 10,000 patients between 24 and 36 weeks and something like 800 fetal anomalies between 26 and 36 weeks in the past 5 years."factcheck.org:http://www.factcheck.org/2015/...The study’s primary finding was that “[i]n many ways, women who had later abortions were similar to those who obtained first-trimester procedures.” It found that those who delayed abortions until later in their pregnancies were more likely to be younger women, those with limited financial resources and those who experienced logistical delays such as the need for extended travel to an abortion provider.Though the study did not include medically necessary late-term abortions, it at least illustrates that there are women receiving abortions after 20 weeks who do so for non-medical reasons.One of the authors of that paper, Diana Greene Foster, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco’s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, told us in an email that “[t]here aren’t good data on how often later abortions are for medical reasons.”   She said based on limited research and discussions with researchers in the field that abortions for fetal anomaly “make up a small minority of later abortions,” Is there a real difference between killing a baby while it's still in a womb, 3 weeks before the due date, and killing it seconds after it's born 3 weeks before the due date?</comment>

S deKay::Friday, March 4, 2016 11:40 PM::<comment>The medical consensus is that the fetus is viable at 26 weeks so abortions at that time or later in the pregnancy would be done for the reasons I mentioned and every effort would be made to keep any fetus expelled alive if signs of life are present.  The study as you say did not include medically necessary late term abortions which would include presumably those with a threat to the mother's life.

Dr. Preobrazhensky::Saturday, March 5, 2016 12:28 AM::<comment> "The medical consensus is that the fetus is viable at 26 weeks About a third of babies born at 23 weeks survive, half of babies born at 24 weeks survive, and 90% of babies born at 26 weeks survive. "so abortions at that time or later in the pregnancy would be done for the reasons I mentioned and every effort would be made to keep any fetus expelled alive if signs of life are present. That's why they are euthanized while still in the uterus.  If somehow this gets botched and the baby is born alive than it must be kept alive.  That's how arbitrary the line between abortion and murder is, in these late-term abortions. "The study as you say did not include medically necessary late term abortions which would include presumably those with a threat to the mother's life. Therefore the study cannot be used to test the accuracy of the statement in my post. You claimed that "almost all" late-term abortions were done in order to either save the woman's life or because the fetus had catastrophic abnormalities.  If indeed "almost all" abortions were done for these reasons the study would not have shown that among non-medically necessary abortions, few abortions involved fetal abnormalities. "If I understand your last sentence you think stillbirths are evidence of murder.No more than someone dying of a heart attack in their sleep is evidence of a murder.  My question was clear: is euthanizing an infant in the womb, 3 weeks before it is born, really different than euthanizing an infant born 3 weeks premature immediately after birth?</comment>

Grumpy::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:07 AM::<comment>Your hypothetical 'euthanization' of a fetus 3 week prior to birth is problematic as a dead fetus in the mother is a serious health risk to the mother.  It doesn't work as part of your hypothesis because no one would ever do it unless they are trying to kill the mother too.  Check the relatively recent incident in Ireland for evidence.</comment>

Dr. Preobrazhensky::Saturday, March 5, 2016 9:25 AM::<comment>Typically the fetus is euthanized immediately prior to removal, by a needle guided into the fetal heart by ultrasound.  In about 5% of cases the fetus survives this attempt.  The removal then becomes rather gruesome.  From wiki:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Once the cervix is sufficiently dilated, the doctor uses an ultrasound and forceps to grasp the fetus's leg. The fetus is turned to a breech position, if necessary, and the doctor pulls one or both legs out of the cervix, which some refer to as "partial birth" of the fetus. The doctor subsequently extracts the rest of the fetus, leaving only the head still inside the uterus. An incision is made at the base of the skull, a blunt dissector (such as a Kelly clamp) is inserted into the incision and opened to widen the opening,[4] and then a suction catheter is inserted into the opening. The brain is suctioned out, which causes the skull to collapse and allows the fetus to pass more easily through the cervix.</comment>

S deKay::Saturday, March 5, 2016 1:27 AM::<comment>The figure for 23 weeks seems to be about 10% too high but the other 2 figures seem about right. To save a woman's life sounds like medical necessity to me.  Thank you for clarifying the last sentence.</comment>

All contraceptives are known to have failures.Furthermore, for many different reasons, she may not have chosen to have sex, so much as consented to avoid other problems.Or, she and her partner might have had unprotected sex while thinking she was in an infertile period.Or...And, if you think about it at all, having sex is not tantamount to deciding to become a parent. That is true for both men and women.</comment>

SoSuMi::Friday, March 4, 2016 4:56 AM::<comment>I don't believe those who use failed contraceptives as an excuse. If you use multiple forms of birth control, it's highly unlikely to result in pregnancy. If you're using birth control, is doesn't matter whether or not you happened to choose to have sex or not as you would already be protected from pregnancy.</comment>

(Supreme Court of Canada, Morgenthaler, 1988)”Pregnant women are NOT unpersons ineligible for treatment as persons. They do not become unpersons because they are pregnant.What worth does a woman's right to life or personhood have if, upon becoming pregnant, her identity as a person with rights is taken away from her as you and other self-identified pro-life people in the U.S.are trying to do? If she is not permitted to make decisions about herself as a person, if we shatter the integrity of her identity, which we do when we take away her powers of morally deciding what is best for her, her family, her life, her biology, her physical integrity, her pyschological integrity, her social identity, and her economic freedom, then no one can safeguard themselves from any violation of their personhood thereafter.Western civilization as we know it has stood upon liberty of conscience subject to reasonable restraints, not unreasonable ones that effectively deny her personhood or her moral agency as a person.</comment>

Sarita La Cubanita::Friday, March 4, 2016 8:48 AM::<comment>Actually, no.  I'm pro-abortion, and the bible nuts are winning, unfortunately.  I believe that each person's body is to do with as he/she wants, and that it's nobody's damned business what that person does with his/her body, yet the bible nuts insist on shoving their religious interpretation down our throats.  Their interpretation of the New Testament is simply that, an interpretation.  Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere in the NT does it talk about abortion.  The bible nuts made the whole damned thing up.  And yet they keep pushing this.  Hell, the fact they keep pushing it makes me want to go have an abortion and tell them about it just to piss them off.What's really really sad however, is that underage girls are @#$#ng boys like crazy, getting pregnant, and guess what?  These underage girls use the bible nuts' excuse for carrying the thing to term and ending up with a child, when they themselves are children.  I think that's sad.  And yet that's what the bible nuts have created, a society in which children are increasingly opting to keep the fertile egg in there to bring ever more offspring into the world, as if they were heifers.  Watch any of those stupid reality shows about teen pregnancy and you'll see.  These incredibly stupid teen girls are using this "let's keep the baby" BS to bring another mouth to feed that they will then raise BADLY to get pregnant too.Very sad.  I don't know what the solution is, frankly.</comment>

JohnJMac::Thursday, March 3, 2016 6:26 PM::<comment>Abortion clinics are shutting down all over the place, not just in Texas:It seems like the business model of the abortion industry is changing. Many of the clinics that have closed in the past five years no longer make enough money to cover expenses. In fact, almost 40 of the clinics that have closed since 2011 cited business or financial reasons for closing. Decreased demand is part of the reason why. Between 2010 to 2014, the abortion rate has dropped by 12 percent.A closer look at the numbers Bloomberg provided appear to show that abortion clinics are consolidating. About 19 percent of the clinics that closed were located in areas with fewer than 100,000 people. Looking at Bloomberg’s map, it appears that all of the 21 clinics that have opened in recent years are located in urban areas. Planned Parenthood owns three-fourths of these. In short, abortion clinics are moving out of the country and into the city, and most of these are operated by Planned Parenthood.http://thefederalist.com/2016/...</comment>

FireWraith::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:41 PM::<comment>And I'm sure that has _nothing_ to do with the passage of laws like the ones in Texas and many other states.

What Are You Looking At?::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:55 AM::<comment>I stated my thought badly. Why shouldn't abortion clinics be made to meet what seem to be rather basic health standards?</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:00 AM::<comment>Because they aren't basic health standards.  The safety around an abortion procedure is 99.97%, far higher than more risky procedures such as plastic surgery which has no similar safety requirement.</comment>

RichardOwens::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:04 AM::<comment>One Justice asked if admitting privileges were required to take a cancer drug (versus RU486).read the questions"That's odd that you point to the New Mexico facility," said Ginsburg. How could Texas argue that the HB 2 provisions are essential to women's health, while also arguing that Texas women aren't burdened by HB 2 because they can access abortions in New Mexico, where clinics aren't subject to HB 2-like provisions? "Send them off to New Mexico, where they don't get either, no admitting privileges, no ASC," said Ginsburg, referring to ambulatory surgical centers. "And that's perfectly all right. Well, if that's all right for the women in the El Paso area, why isn't it right for the rest of the women in Texas?" "</comment>

Mr. Fusion::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:35 AM::<comment>No other health procedure requires those stringent standards, including all the procedures that are much more dangerous.</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:58 AM::<comment>Actually it seems MORE reasonable to require hospitals to grant admitting privileges to obstetricians who perform abortions.  That is, if a woman's health is the concern.</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:09 AM::<comment>Why would the doctor need to be set up to work at the hospital, why couldn't an ER doctor or other doctor already affiliated with the hospital handle it if the woman needed to transfer?</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:34 AM::<comment>They can, I am just pointing out that the faux concern is hypocritical.  If the worry is whether women can get service in the event of some emergency, the burden should be on the hospitals, not the obstetricians in another practice.</comment>

FireWraith::Friday, March 4, 2016 2:24 AM::<comment>Because they were requiring that for even taking a pill. Because they didn't require that for any number of procedures that were far more dangerous and had many more instances of complications, like colonoscopies. Because they couldn't point to one definitive instance where a doctor having actual admitting privileges, rather than just a transfer agreement, would have made the difference in a case. Because they argued that the people affected by the clinic closing in El Paso could just go to the one across the border, despite the fact that New Mexico doesn't have any of those requirements that they claim is absolutely necessary to protect womens' health.</comment>

Gn8 the Questioner::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:55 AM::<comment>You left out -very conveniently I might add- some context regarding those numbers, there were 161 clinics that closed since 2011, that means 3/4ths of the closures were not related to business or financial reasons -at least as reported by the clinics.

Sarah5::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:03 PM::<comment>Abortion to unwanted pregnancy is one of the last things responsible people think about. If women find themselves without $$ to pay for a possible abortion, maybe they should use extra precautions with birth control. Just keeping up with ovulation is pretty simple. There are plenty of donors of women's healthcare, like Warren Buffett's massive foundation. We need more conservative counseling for these irresponsible people rather than liberal enabling of them for the sole purpose of Democratic power. Is this how liberals raise their own children? This issue should not be used as a political pawn any longer. </comment>

carolannie::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:07 PM::<comment>Well, sweetie, I would feel that the usual reasons for abortion (failure of birth control) might pre-empt your argument. Also, note that your co-religionist forced-birthers want to get rid of all contraception too. Hence your argument is pretty lame</comment>

Sarah5::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:31 PM::<comment>What they want and what reality is are two different things. Contraception is widely available and there are lots of donor funds available as well.

FireWraith::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:45 PM::<comment>Nevermind that they aren't willing to do things to empower or encourage women to choose to have a baby, like paying for healthcare. One of the reasons many poor women feel like they have to have abortions is because they already have kids, and can't affford to pay to take care of any more. Oh, wait, but they don't want poor people having kids because welfare leeches or something, so I guess the only answer the Republicans are okay with is that those horrible poor people should just stop having sex or something.</comment>

Dani::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:44 AM::<comment>While it seems clear that you are a TROLL, you seem to be confused about the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being  used for abortions. So your argument is sort of garbage and was solved, oh I don't know, forever ago. And secondly, IF you are a real person, you certainly aren't capable and mature enough to be making decisions for other people, as evident in your rhetoric. Nice try honey.</comment>

I have only taken 1 selfie, fully clothed. I'm amazed at women quite a bit older than me  taking bathing suit selfies or nudies, or other narcissistic photos.

Sarah5::Friday, March 4, 2016 12:15 AM::<comment>Yes but apparently "Mr Wonderful" is sometimes just as irresponsible and would rather chance it. The pill or free IUDs are more reliable. It's all pretty easy. Women need to take responsible for themselves because some men, obviously, won't stick around if a pregnancy and even childbirth occur. Many male pigs out there. </comment>

Gn8 the Questioner::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:02 AM::<comment>So I take it you would be against Republican efforts to limit access to or education about contraceptives?</comment>

Sarah5::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:06 AM::<comment>Not at all. I'm all for contraception, but middle school girls should be taught to refrain from sexual activity out of respect for their body and lack of maturity. My school taught this in high school. </comment>

Gn8 the Questioner::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:16 AM::<comment>Do you think that being taught restraint is incompatible with more modern sex-ed? I was also taught that in school, however a close neighboring school (which had the same curriculum) had one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the region, so telling teens "just don't do 'X'" alone, is not a viable solution.</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:47 AM::<comment>I keep telling you you have won and you keep being upset as though you haven't got your way.  You are the victor, not the victim.  Zero tax dollars have funded a single abortion since 1976.</comment>

Sarah5::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:55 AM::<comment>No you did not tell me I won. You kept missing my point. Donors are best suited for these issues. Take it out of politics. It's a boring issue nowadays - too ideological and personal choice oriented. </comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 3:59 AM::<comment>Oh Lord.  Yes I agree, it SHOULD be as political as appendectomies but we don't have a party saying that appendectomies shouldn't be taxpayer funded.  We don't have one party trying to make appendectomies more difficult to obtain.  So yes, it has been politicized, but not by the left.A clear fact: You don't want your taxes to pay for abortions.  You won, they are not. They are paid for by donors (and patients and their insurers)  just like you want.</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 4:17 AM::<comment>Not a single tax dollar can go for abortions.  Funds for that must be kept separate by law.  If you don't think so then there is no point in keeping the Hyde Amendment and I beg you to please contact your Congressman and ask them to get rid of it.</comment>

Sarah5::Friday, March 4, 2016 4:17 AM::<comment>Insurance companies decide what is necessary and customary. Unplanned pregnancies are a direct result of poor choices, no gray areas about it. Appendectomies are not. Not a logical comparison.Morning after pill is cheap and smart.</comment>

Pezdrake::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:36 AM::<comment>Actually it's not.  Having unprotected sex or protected sex is a gamble whether it will lead to a viable pregnancy.  There's as much direct choice as not wearing a bike helmet.</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:31 AM::<comment>The choice to be raped is an interesting one.  The choice to get sick, take antibiotics and have your birth control fail because of it is also an interesting one.  The choice to purchase a birth control product from a company that had manufacturing failures is also a very interesting choice.  If you don't understand that everything before this sentence was sarcasm I prove my earlier point that you are too ignorant to participate in political debate.</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:28 AM::<comment>It has always been ideological vs personal choice.  This article covers that clinics are being closed all over the place in Texas, you understood that right?  That it has gone to the supreme court of the United States because it is viewed by one side of the issue as an undue restriction on a womans right to abort?  How is a poor woman in a small town in rural Texas supposed to find these donors that are willing to send her to New Mexico?</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:25 AM::<comment>Sarah really really doesn't understand anything here.  But in her world it's pretty awesome because apparently poor young women have rich parents.</comment>

Sarah5::Friday, March 4, 2016 1:29 AM::<comment>Hmm not familiar with it, but I've heard of it. There are many alternatives, even for those against contraception. Ovulation temp tests and women just being familiar with their own cycle can be easy, assuming they have normal cycles.</comment>

rite4forlife::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:24 PM::<comment>“We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.  And the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”– Margaret Sanger’s December 19, 1939 letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble, 255 Adams Street, Milton, Massachusetts.</comment>

Sagrav::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:46 PM::<comment>That quote isn't very relevant.  If you're trying to imply that Margaret Sanger actually wanted to exterminate black people, your quote contradicts this.  She is talking about employing members of the black religious community of the time to reach out and explain that her goal isn't the extermination of their race.  It seems that this rumor was just as strong then as it is now.</comment>

Whateveryousay::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:29 PM::<comment>Basically the party of no solution has a loud mouth. These idiots don't realize a majority of those not getting an abortion, would end up getting welfare, and if in the inner cities, would grow up without a father and be a part of "thug" culture. That is everything they stand against. So basically for irrational people like that it's all about being angry, not look for solutions, and point fingers angrily. I say let the poor women of color get abortions so that later on those "non-aborted" kids don't become a societal problem. They don't join gangs. They don't sell drugs. They don't grow up without a dad or both parents. They don't become a liability for society.</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 5:35 AM::<comment>Hey, my white daughter's kids might become thugs too, let her have an abortion if she wants one!</comment>

Whateveryousay::Friday, March 4, 2016 6:48 PM::<comment>Here's the thing Grumpy. If she wants one, it's her decision. The only other person she should talk to is the father of the baby.</comment>

Grumpy::Friday, March 4, 2016 11:28 PM::<comment>I question your use of the word 'should' but otherwise agree with this statement whole heartedly.  Should is too strong, it's gonna depend on her relationship with they guy.  My thought on it has always been that if a guy doesn't keep close enough tabs on a woman he has had sex with to know that he knocked her up he probably doesn't deserve to be a father anyway.</comment>

Whateveryousay::Saturday, March 5, 2016 12:13 AM::<comment>Well I'm only suggesting she talk to him, not let him have a say in what she should do. But I think a father, that's ready to be there, should at least get some sort of communication from the mother. I mean I would probably feel bad if I knew my kid was being aborted and I would like to have some form of communication and closure. I wouldn't try to force her to keep it obviously since I support pro-choice.</comment>
