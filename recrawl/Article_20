Ted Cruz's Alaska Win 


U.S. Senator Ted Cruz is projected to have won the Republican presidential caucuses in Alaska.With all the precincts reporting, Cruz narrowly defeated Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, 7,973 votes (36.4 percent) to 7,346 (33.5 percent), according to the Associated Press.Alaska will send 28 delegates to the Republican convention in Cleveland on July 18. The win gives Cruz 12 delegates. Trump, who had secured the support of Sarah Palin, the state’s former governor, will take home 11. Marco Rubio, the U.S. senator from Florida, who finished third in the state, will get five. Alaska Dispatch News reported that, in all, 21,930 votes were cast.Cruz won in 24 of the state’s 40 legislative districts. Trump won 15. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, took one; Rubio none.His second-place finish in Alaska notwithstanding, Donald Trump had a very super Tuesday. He won in seven states, including much of the South. Cruz won three, including his home state of Texas, and Oklahoma. Rubio was projected to win in Minnesota.Trump now has 285 delegates; Cruz has 161; Rubio 87. The first to secure 1,237 delegates will win the presidential nomination.You can read our full coverage of Super Tuesday here.


Américo Gonçalves::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:35 PM::<comment>Finally, the question has been answered: "How valuable is a Sarah Palin's endorsement ? " It's worth "nutin".</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:38 PM::<comment>Not much of a victory for the Texan Cubanadian; he won 12 delegates, but Trump won 11 delegates and Rubio snagged 5. Not a whole lot of bragging rights for Cruz here.</comment>

Martin Shkreli Trump::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:38 PM::<comment>Ted Cruz cheated in Alaska.  It's that simple. HE CHEATED.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:40 PM::<comment>That would not surprise me after the dirty trick he pulled on Carson.  Cruz is the most unsavory clown in the GOP clown car... he just comes off as a slime ball.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:46 PM::<comment>Sore loser.If Trump can't handle Cruz, why should anyone trust Trump against the Clinton Leviathan?</comment>

Martin Shkreli Trump::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:35 AM::<comment>Guy who supports someone with less than half of Trump's delegates calls someone else a "loser."Classy.</comment>

GIJ::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:49 PM::<comment>Well, that means Cruz managed to win one Super Tuesday state which borders his native country.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 5:51 PM::<comment>Texas and Cuba share a border?  Texas and Canada share a border?</comment>

John Straka::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:08 PM::<comment>This article is about Alaska.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:11 PM::<comment>I see... Alaska and Canada share a border... Cruz is an Canadian anchor baby.</comment>

neoritter::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:12 AM::<comment>If you're going to use a political term for a joke, you could at least know what I means.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:23 PM::<comment>My bad, I was thinking about Cruz winning Texas.</comment>

Queequeg::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:42 PM::<comment>It borders Canada, where Cruz was born. </comment>

Openuris::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:32 PM::<comment>He had a lot of help from Texas democrats to boot. I know a ton who voted for him instead of the democratic primary just to go against Trump.</comment>

Social Glimpse::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:10 PM::<comment>Bible thumpers worked their muscle and thawed for Cruz, but consider the source, far outpost of our empire...producing, wait for it...Palin? "yeah!, lets shout for Jesus now to swoop us up"...please sweep them up ! Enough white trash!</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:14 PM::<comment>It's still dark in Alaska at this time of year... cabin fever has set in.</comment>

AK_Pleb::Thursday, March 3, 2016 12:16 AM::<comment>Don't blame us for Palin.  We voted for her as Governor.Just because someone works as a small time manager doesn't mean we want them as the CEO.</comment>

Social Glimpse::Thursday, March 3, 2016 2:13 AM::<comment>Live with it! equivocating  much?, feel the squirm, it's public now dude.</comment>

John832::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:30 AM::<comment>Jesus is far more likely to save you than populist rhetoric from an oligarch with a record of differing positions than the ones he is spouting now.</comment>

Social Glimpse::Thursday, March 3, 2016 2:22 AM::<comment>Hold on bub, that one is shopping for Biblical verse to spring more exceptional America by divine righteousness? and the other steers in secular tones on dem side, your no friend of Jefferson are ya? No worries bub,Oh yeah, and as your recommending Jesus? as the answer, know this, "Hell is full of preachers" John 3:16 let it be a comfort and stop trolling.</comment>

John832::Thursday, March 3, 2016 5:18 AM::<comment>Actually I was more not recommending a blustering oligarch of questionable ideological stability.</comment>

jpaulmercurio::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 6:51 PM::<comment>Where is everyone getting their delegate counts from?  CNN is reporting Trump 315, Cruz 205, Rubio 106.  FiveThirtyEight estimates 262, 215, 93.  The Atlantic (va Google) reports 285, 161, 87.Only 538 gives any prominence that their numbers are estimates.  Are the differences based on opaque party rules and no official "score keeper"?</comment>

orangeglacier::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7:38 PM::<comment>I've recently seen reports that even in New Hampshire from a month ago, one of Rubio's delegates was misassigned to Trump by the party.  If even the party can't get its counts right, the media has no chance.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7:49 PM::<comment>Excellent question.  Apparently this vote counting really is rocket science.</comment>

RichardOwens::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:24 PM::<comment>After watching the Rules Committee run the House of Representatives every stinking day, it is obvious Republicans are used to operating a controlled environment free of any real democracy.The RNC is a crime family that has found itself in an awkward situation with a different "Don".</comment>

OpulentFatcat::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7:05 PM::<comment>All his fellow vampires can get out and vote since it's always dark up there.</comment>

YourSupremeCommander::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7:57 PM::<comment>Cruz winning Alaska is as important as you finding a quarter on the sidewalk.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:20 PM::<comment>Cruz can see Russia now?</comment>

Toxteth O'Grady::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 8:58 PM::<comment>Didn't Palin endorse Trump?So no one listens to her in Alaska either.</comment>

new_york_loner::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:01 PM::<comment>Not true.  Cruz got 12 delegates, Trump won 11.  Looks like 49% of Alaskans did listen to Palin.</comment>

neoritter::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:13 AM::<comment>At least do like a 5 second look at Bing. 33% of Alaskans. 11+12 != 28</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:40 PM::<comment>Ted keeps racking up wins.  Go Ted!</comment>

Queequeg::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:41 PM::<comment>Cruz is actually worse than Trump. If he got the nomination, the Republicans would be going from terrible to truly terrifyingly horrible. </comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 9:45 PM::<comment>Libbies hate Ted.What a surprise.  Yet another reason to pull for Ted.</comment>

RichardOwens::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:16 PM::<comment>Just a little question about your handle:Do you have bodies of children in the crawl space under your home like the other Wayne Gacy, or is he just someone you admire?</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:24 PM::<comment>I've already answered this question.  Search my history if you care.Bottom line: libbies SHOULD fear Ted Cruz.</comment>

RichardOwens::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:33 PM::<comment>liar.  just more hate in your comments.  You even hated on limoman calling him a limousine liberal.You seem to be a waste of skin and a vile hateful excuse for a human being.But maybe you're faking that.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:41 PM::<comment>From a month ago in my history:"I don't like John Wayne Gacy. The point is that you can't be uncomfortable doing hard things, and taking hard steps. Hilary Clinton is ruthless. Ted Cruz is ruthless. We need ruthless to keep the country together and to move us back towards conservative principles.Besides, people say nasty things about Cruz all the time. Libbies call him a "psycho." What I'm doing is re-appropriating that insult; it's a tactic the libbies should understand."Also from a month ago (after the above comment):"I've already answered this question. Liberals have whined about Ted Cruz being a "serial killer." They're afraid of him. AND THEY SHOULD BE. I'm using their BS against them."Also from a month ago:"I've already explained this. It's a re-appropriation of a liberal meme. I'm using their hypocrisy against them."LEARN TO READ, Dick.</comment>

RichardOwens::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:27 PM::<comment>Your posts are cruel, and they are void of any value whatsoever, except to the forces of evil.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:54 PM::<comment>Perhaps.</comment>

Jim::Thursday, March 3, 2016 2:35 AM::<comment>We liberal love Ted and hope he gets the nomination, because Clinton will eviscerate him in the general election.</comment>

unboundried::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:30 PM::<comment>I'm struggling to understand the rationale used to publish the most irrelevant thing about Super Tuesday. Regardless, Ted's win was more about what Alaskans think about Sarah Palin than Ted.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:43 PM::<comment>Ted also won Texas and Oklahoma.  Downplay it all you want.  Cruz is doing just fine.</comment>

unboundried::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:48 PM::<comment>Other than losing Super Tuesday by a large margin.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:50 PM::<comment>Donald is up to about 15% of the delegates he needs.  It's barely half way through the first quarter and the Trump Marching Band is already walking on the field.</comment>

unboundried::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:54 PM::<comment>If it were a basketball game I would flip channels. Just because the buzzer hasn't sounded doesn't mean that the game isn't over.</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:57 PM::<comment>In that case, feel free to stop commenting about politics.  You obviously don't care enough to watch the whole show.</comment>

unboundried::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 10:58 PM::<comment>Guys like you make it entertaining. :)</comment>

Ted Wayne Gacy::Wednesday, March 2, 2016 11:03 PM::<comment>It must make you laugh to see a liberal like Trump trying to fool America.  You're pro-socialism, I guess.</comment>

Ming On Mongo::Thursday, March 3, 2016 7:55 AM::<comment>What really makes us laugh is watching the GOP's circular firing squad!</comment>

neoritter::Thursday, March 3, 2016 1:10 AM::<comment>It's probably the fact that until about a few hours ago, Trump was projected and listed as winning Alaska.</comment>

Uncle Luie::Thursday, March 3, 2016 4:29 AM::<comment>Its nice that he finally found someone to support him, too bad she is brainless.</comment>

AnnieOMG::Thursday, March 3, 2016 2:10 AM::<comment>Ted Cruz stands there trying to look so presidential. In reality he is as cunning as a fox and as slimy as snail. He's far too radical for the general population. His kind of talk goes down well with his base but it won't wash with the rest of the country. He lives in another world one where only Christians are looked upon as wholesome and others of any other faith must be cast to the side. He's arrogant and most certainly will never be POTUS. Plus Cruz was a proud Canadian until he wasn't and realized he loved America so much he had to give Canada the boot. America will be giving him the boot soon enough alongside Rubio and Trump. No more Republicans running the country. They only run the country into the ground. That they do very very well.</comment>

Midwest::Thursday, March 3, 2016 8:09 AM::<comment>How about the guy who called McConnell a liar now asking for the GOP to unite behind him?  What a hypocrite. </comment>

RichardOwens::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:32 PM::<comment>Funny, though.  McConnell has five sides to his mouth.</comment>

Theodore Wirth::Thursday, March 3, 2016 9:39 AM::<comment>BFHD (figure the acronym out for yourself or vote for Cruz in an election near you). Now the Canadian tail gunner can join the crew that can see Russia from their bedroom windows.</comment>
